'''''Suillus placidus''''', is a species of fungus in the genus ''[[Suillus]]''. It is an edible [[Boletales|pored mushroom]] found in European and North American coniferous forests, growing in association with several species of [[Pinus|pine]] of the subgenus ''Strobus''.

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''Suillus placidus'' is hemispherical when young, later becoming convex. It is ivory white in colour and very slimy, growing to 10&nbsp;cm in diameter. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is slender, ringless and ivory white with grey granular dots or blotches near the top. The soft [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is yellowish white with a mild taste. The [[spore]]s are ochre.<ref name=Garnweidner1994/>

==Ecology==
''Suillus placidus'' is found in Asia, Europe and North America occurring exclusively alongside species of five-needled [[Pinus|pine]] of the subgenus ''Strobus''. The [[Mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] association is beneficial for both fungus and tree, and is a form of [[symbiosis]].

In Asia, it is known to occur in the [[Russian Far East]] with [[Siberian pine]] (''Pinus sibirica''), [[Siberian dwarf pine]] (''P. pumila'') and [[Korean pine]] (''P. koraiensis'').<ref name=MirRastenii/> It has also been reported in [[China]].<ref name=Guangdong/>

It is rarely seen in Europe, where it is known to form ectomycorrhizal associations with [[Swiss pine]] (''Pinus cembra'') and introduced [[eastern white pine]] (''P. strobus'').<ref name=Deconchat2002/><ref name=Laessoe1996/> In north-eastern North America, its range coincides with that of the native eastern white pine (''P. strobus'').

The fungus fruits in summer and autumn with fruiting bodies occurring singly or in small groups.

==Edibility==
''Suillus placidus'' is reportedly edible,<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil |url-access=registration |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil/page/291 291]}}</ref> but of mediocre quality.<ref name=Deconchat2002/><ref name=Laessoe1996/>
