'''''Rhodocybe gemina''''' is a [[species]] of [[fungus]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Entolomataceae]]. It has the recommended English name of '''tan pinkgill'''<ref name="BMS"/> and produces [[agaric|agaricoid]] [[basidiocarps]] (fruit bodies) that are fleshy and cream when young, becoming brownish when mature.

==Taxonomy==
The species was originally named ''Hypophyllum geminum'' in 1793 by French [[mycologist]] [[Jean-Jacques Paulet]] and transferred to the [[genus]] ''[[Rhodocybe]]'' in 1987.<ref name="Noord1987"/> Prior to this, the species was commonly known as ''Rhodocybe truncata'' (Schaeff.) [[Rolf Singer|Singer]], based on ''Agaricus truncatus'' described by [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] in 1774. No original specimen of Schäffer's species exists, however, and the original description is so ambiguous that it has also been referred to the genus ''[[Hebeloma]]'' (as ''Hebeloma truncatum''  (Schaeff.) [[P. Kumm.]]) by some authorities.<ref name="Noord1987"/> ''Rhodocybe truncata'' is now considered a [[nomen dubium]] and is no longer in use.<ref name="Mattock2005"/>

In 2009, as a result of [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] research, based on [[cladistic]] analysis of [[DNA sequences]], CoDavid et al. included ''Rhodocybe gemina'' in their expanded concept of ''[[Clitopilus]]''.<ref name=CoDavid/> Subsequent research showed, however, that ''Rhodocybe'' is a [[monophyletic]] (natural) genus and that ''R. gemina'' belongs within it.<ref name="Kluting 2014"/>

==Description==
The [[pileipellis|skin]] of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is matt, not slimy or shiny. The cap is up to 120 mm wide, at first somewhat [[umbo (mycology)|umbonate]], later becoming irregular and flattened, and brownish ochre to pinkish ochre. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] to [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]] in attachment and the stem is whitish – often lighter than the gills and relatively short, but always lacking a [[partial veil|veil]] or [[volva (mycology)|volva]]. The [[spore print]] is flesh-coloured to salmon-pink. Microscopically the spores are angular when viewed on end; when viewed from the side they are irregularly warted.<ref name="Mattock2005"/>

A [[saprotrophic]] species, it generally grows in woodlands, both [[deciduous forest|broadleaved]] and occasionally [[coniferous forest|coniferous]], but also in grassland and scrub.<ref name="Mattock2005"/>
