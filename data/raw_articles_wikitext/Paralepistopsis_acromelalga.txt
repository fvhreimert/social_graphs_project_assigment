'''''Paralepistopsis acromelalga''''' is a [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] in the [[Tricholomataceae]] family. It was formerly classified as ''Clitocybe'' ''acromelalga''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Species Fungorum - Paralepistopsis acromelalga (Ichimura) Vizzini, Mycotaxon 120: 261 (2012) |url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=564342 |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=www.speciesfungorum.org}}</ref>

== Taxonomy ==
It was first [[Species description|described]] in 1918 by the mycologist [[T. Ichimura]] and classified as ''Clitocybe'' ''acromelalga''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Species Fungorum - Clitocybe acromelalga Ichimura, Bot. Gaz., Chicago 65: 110 (1918) |url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=208518 |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=www.speciesfungorum.org}}</ref>

The ''[[Paralepistopsis]]'' genus was created in 2012 by the Italian mycologist [[Alfredo Vizzini]] to better classify two rare toxic species formerly located in the ''[[Clitocybe]]'' genus and this species was subsequently reclassified.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal |last1=Vizzini |first1=Alfredo |last2=Ercole |first2=Enrico |date=2012-09-28 |title=Paralepistopsis gen. nov. and Paralepista (Basidiomycota, Agaricales) |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=120 |issue=1 |pages=253–267 |doi=10.5248/120.253|doi-access=free |hdl=2318/124414 |hdl-access=free }}</ref>

== Habitat and distribution ==
It has been found in Japan, South Korea and Mexico <ref name=":02"/>

== Toxicity ==
It was discovered to be poisonous in 1918, when symptoms of [[mushroom poisoning]] occurred within three days of consumption. It had been mistaken for the edible tawny funnel cap (''[[Paralepista flaccida]]'' formerly ''Lepista flaccida'').<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ichimura  |first=J |year=1918|title=A new poisonous mushroom |journal=Bot Gaz (Tokyo) |volume=65 |pages=10911}}</ref>

Consumption of a related species, ''[[Paralepistopsis amoenolens]]'', from France has resulted in the same condition.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Saviuc PF, Danel VC, Moreau PA, Guez DR, Claustre AM, Carpentier PH, Mallaret MP, Ducluzeau R |year=2001|title=Erythromelalgia and mushroom poisoning |journal=J Toxicol Clin Toxicol |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=403–07|doi=10.1081/CLT-100105162 |pmid=11527236|s2cid=32805160 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Diaz |first=James H.|date=February 2005 |title=Syndromic diagnosis and management of confirmed mushroom poisonings

That species is commonly known as the paralysis cap and has been shown to contain acromelic acids including [[acromelic acid A]] which is a potent [[neurotoxin]] with the chemical formula of {{chem2|C13H14N2O7}} and is associated with causing paralysis and seizures<ref>{{Cite web |last=PubChem |title=Acromelic acid A |url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/108086 |access-date=2022-07-19 |website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |language=en}}</ref>
