'''''Amanita crocea''''', the '''saffron ringless amanita''',<ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> is a species of ''[[Amanita]]'' widely distributed in [[Europe]]. It is edible but not recommended for consumption due to its similarity to [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species of the genus.

==Description==
]]

* '''Cap''': The cap is free of rings with the [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] and has a diameter of {{Convert|5–10|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}}, yellow-orange in colour with an apricot tinge at the centre. It expands to become flat or sometimes convex at the [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]], a  small raised central area.
* '''Volva''': Thick, white, at least {{Convert|4–10|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} wide, saffron orange or a little browner than that in colour in the centre when fresh and paler at the margin.
* '''Gills''': [[Gills]] are free and cream in mass (sometimes with a slight salmon or pinkish reflection, and 2–3± millimetres broad.)
* '''Stem/stipe''': The stem or stipe is {{Convert|10–15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long and 1–1.5&nbsp;cm in diameter, tapering, decorated with paler [[fibril]]s in a "flame" pattern, with the decoration later becoming orange or brown-orange (darker than the underlying stipe surface) with a membranous sack-like volva at the base.
*'''Spores''': The white spores measure (8.0-) 9.4 - 11.8 (-18.8) x (7.5-) 8.5 - 11.0 (-16.0) μm.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/croceas.html |title=Amanita crocea |access-date=2010-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714185658/http://www.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/croceas.html |archive-date=2011-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>http://www.first-nature.com/fungi/id_guide/amanitaceae/amanita_crocea.php {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226055532/http://www.first-nature.com/fungi/id_guide/amanitaceae/amanita_crocea.php |date=2010-12-26 }} Amanita crocea-Pictures, habitat and identification guide.</ref>

It is similar to ''[[Amanita fulva]]'' (orange-brown ringless amanita or tawny grisette) and ''[[Amanita caesarea|A. caesarea]]'' (Caesar's mushroom), belonging to the ''Vaginatae'' and ''[[Caesareae]]'' sections of the ''[[Amanita]]'' genus, respectively.

The edible tawny grisette is a [[basidiomycete]] [[mushroom]] located in [[North America]] and [[Europe]].<ref>http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5539.asp {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221200708/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5539.asp |date=2016-12-21 }} Rogers mushrooms.</ref> It is easily confused with the '[[death cap]]', though is not as substantial. The structure is relatively flimsy and the hollow stem often breaks, even when handled very gently.<ref>http://www.wildaboutbritain.co.uk/tawny-grisette {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716111904/http://www.wildaboutbritain.co.uk/tawny-grisette|date=2011-07-16}} Tawny Grisette | Wild About Britain.</ref> It has fibres on its stalk usually.<ref>http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/Taxa/Amanifulva22.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610120826/http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/Taxa/Amanifulva22.html |date=2011-06-10 }} Amanita fulva</ref>

The second similar species, the Caesar's mushroom, is the [[type species]] (a species to which the name of a genus is permanently linked) of the ''Caesareae'' section of the genus ''Amanita''. It has a distinctive orange cap, yellow gills and stem. Similar orange-capped species occur in North America and India.<ref>Amanita caesarea. http://alphagamma.150m.com/Amanita_caesarea.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707055156/http://alphagamma.150m.com/Amanita_caesarea.html|date=2011-07-07}}</ref><ref>http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/caesarea.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104330/http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/caesarea.html|date=2011-07-16}} by R.E. Tulloss.</ref>

==Ecology==
The fungi can occur infrequently between July and October in [[mycorrhiza]]l with hardwood trees, particularly birch and beech in clearings. Its odour is sweet-smelling and it has a mildly nutty sweet taste.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.first-nature.com/fungi/id_guide/amanitaceae/amanita_crocea.php |title=Amanita crocea |access-date=2010-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226055532/http://www.first-nature.com/fungi/id_guide/amanitaceae/amanita_crocea.php |archive-date=2010-12-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It has also been reported from Iran.<ref name=bahram>{{cite journal|last=Bahram|first=M|author2=Asef, M.

== Uses ==
While edible, guides advise not to eat it as many similar-looking ''Amanitas'' are very [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=22}}</ref>
