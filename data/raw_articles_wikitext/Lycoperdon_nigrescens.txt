'''''Lycoperdon nigrescens''''', with the synonym '''''Lycoperdon foetidum''''', commonly known as the '''dusky puffball''',<ref name="Phillips 2013"/> is a type of [[puffball]] mushroom in the genus ''[[Lycoperdon]]''. It was first [[species description|described]] scientifically in 1794 by the Swedish naturalist [[Göran Wahlenberg]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Lycoperdon nigrescens"/>

The fruit body grows up to {{Convert|6|cm|frac=4}} tall and {{Convert|4|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide.<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/692/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, California |pages=692-93 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> The caps are shaped somewhat like pears, with spines ranging in brightness, which later break off.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last1=Trudell |first1=Steve |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest |last2=Ammirati |first2=Joe |publisher=Timber Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5 |series=Timber Press Field Guides |location=Portland, OR |pages=269 |language=en}}</ref> The surface is dark between the spines.

It appears from summer to fall in both [[conifer]] and [[hardwood]] forests, in addition to alpine areas.<ref name=":0" /> Its edibility is unknown, but related puffballs are edible in youth, when still firm and white inside.<ref name="Arora1986" />
