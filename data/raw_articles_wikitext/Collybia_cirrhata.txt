'''''Collybia cirrhata''''' is a [[species]] of [[fungus]] in the family [[Tricholomataceae]] of the order [[Agaricales]] (gilled [[mushroom]]s). The species was first [[species description|described]] in the scientific literature in 1786, but was not [[valid name (botany)|validly]] named until 1803. Found in Europe, Northern Eurasia, and North America, it is known from [[temperate]], [[subarctic climate|boreal]], and [[alpine climate|alpine]] or [[climate of the Arctic|arctic]] habitats. It is a [[saprobic]] species that grows in clusters on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are small, with whitish convex to flattened [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|11|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=8}} in diameter, narrow white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], and slender whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] {{convert|8|–|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} long and up to {{convert|2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick. ''C.&nbsp;cirrhata'' can be distinguished from the other two members of ''[[Collybia]]'' by the absence of a [[sclerotium]] at the base of the stem. 

A 2023 chemical analysis found that this mushroom contains 17 to 56 mg/kg of the mycotoxin muscarine.   <ref name="l910">{{cite journal | last1=He | first1=Zheng-Mi | last2=Chen | first2=Zuo-Hong | last3=Bau | first3=Tolgor | last4=Wang | first4=Geng-Shen | last5=Yang | first5=Zhu L. | title=Systematic arrangement within the family Clitocybaceae (Tricholomatineae, Agaricales): phylogenetic and phylogenomic evidence, morphological data and muscarine-producing innovation | journal=Fungal Diversity | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=123 | issue=1 | year=2023 | issn=1560-2745 | doi=10.1007/s13225-023-00527-2 | pages=1–47}}</ref>

The species first appeared in the scientific literature in 1786 as ''Agaricus amanitae'' by [[August Johann Georg Karl Batsch]];<ref name=Batsch1786/> ''Agaricus amanitae'' subsp. ''cirrhatus'', proposed by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1800,<ref name=Persoon1799/> is considered [[synonym (biology)|synonymous]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Collybia cirrhata"/> A later combination based on this name, ''Collybia amanitae'', was published by [[Hanns Kreisel]] in 1987.<ref name=Kreisel1987/> However, Kreisel noted the combination to be "''ined.''",<ref name=Kasuya2009/> indicating that he did not believe the name to be [[validly published name|validly]] published, according to article 34.1 of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|rules for botanical nomenclature]], which states: "A name is not validly published ... when it is not accepted by the author in the original publication."<ref name="Vienna Code 34.1"/>

The first valid name was published in 1803 by [[Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher]], who called the species ''Agaricus cirrhatus''.<ref name=Schumacher1803/> French mycologist [[Lucien Quélet]] transferred it to ''Collybia'' in 1879,<ref name=Quelet1872/> resulting in the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial]] by which it is currently known. The species had also been transferred to ''Microcollybia'' by [[Georges Métrod]] in 1952<ref name=Metrod1952/> and again by Lennox in 1979 (because Métrod's transfer was considered a ''[[nomen nudum]]'', and thus invalid according to nomenclatural rules);<ref name=Lennox1979/> the genus ''Microcollybia'' has since been wrapped into ''Collybia''.<ref name=Kirk2008/>

[[Molecular phylogenetics]] have shown that ''C.&nbsp;cirrhata'' forms a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]] with the remaining two species of ''Collybia''. Because ''C.&nbsp;cirrhata'' is the only one of the three ''Collybia'' species lacking [[sclerotia]], it has been suggested that this character trait is an ''[[anapomorphy]]''—that is, unique to a single, terminal species within a clade.<ref name=Hughes2001/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] {{lang|la|cirrata}}, meaning "curled".<ref name=Rea1922/> [[Charles Horton Peck]] called it the "fringed-rooted Collybia".<ref name=Peck1888/> In the United Kingdom, it is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "piggyback shanklet".<ref name="urlBMS common names"/>

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex when young, later becoming convex to flattened or slightly depressed in the center, reaching a diameter of {{convert|3|–|11|mm|in|abbr=on|frac=8}}. The cap margin starts out rolled or curved inward, but straightens out as it matures. The cap surface ranges from dry to moist, smooth to covered with fine whitish hairs, and is mostly even with translucent radial grooves at the margin. It is [[hygrophanous|subhygrophanous]] (changing color somewhat depending on hydration), becoming a grayish-orange when watery or old, and usually is white with a very faint pinkish flush when fresh. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, quite thin, and has no distinctive taste or odor. The [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are [[adnation|adnate]] to slightly arcuate (curved into the shape of a bow) with a tooth (meaning that the gills curve up to join the stem but then, very close to the stem, the gill edge curves down again).<ref name=Miller2006/> There are between 12 and 20 gills that extend completely from the cap edge to the stem, and three to five tiers of lamellulae (shorter gills that do not extend completely from the cap edge to the stem).<ref name=Kasuya2009/> The gills are thin, narrow to moderately broad, and white to pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]]. The gill edges are even, and the same color as the gill faces.<ref name="urlHalling"/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|8|–|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} long and up to {{convert|2|mm|in|2|abbr=on|frac=16}} thick, equal in width throughout to slightly enlarged downward, flexible and filamentous but not fragile. The stem surface is dry, whitish to grayish-orange, sometimes with tiny hairs on the upper portion that become coarser near the base. The stem base often has [[rhizomorph]]-like strands or copious whitish [[mycelia]]. The stem, unlike the other two species of ''Collybia'', do not originate from a [[sclerotium]]. The stem becomes hollow as it matures.<ref name="urlHalling"/> ''C.&nbsp;cirrhata'' is too small and insubstantial to be considered [[edible mushroom|edible]].<ref name=Miller2006/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
In [[spore print|deposit]], the spores appear white.<ref name=Kasuya2009/> Individual [[spore]]s are ellipsoid to tear-shaped in profile, obovoid to ellipsoid or roughly cylindric in face or back view, with dimensions of 4.8–6.4 by 2–2.8 (sometimes up to 3.5) [[micrometre|μm]]. They are smooth, [[inamyloid]], and acyanophilous (unreactive to [[staining]] with [[Melzer's reagent]] and [[methyl blue]], respectively). The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells of the [[hymenium]]) are roughly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 17.5–21 by 4.8–5.6&nbsp;μm. The gills do not have [[cystidia]]. The gill tissue is made of [[hypha]]e that are interwoven to roughly parallel, and inamyloid. The hyphae are 2.8–8.4&nbsp;μm in diameter and smooth. The cap tissue is made of interwoven hyphae beneath the center of the cap, but radially oriented over the gills; it too is inamyloid. These hyphae are 3.5–8.4&nbsp;μm in diameter, smooth, but have irregularly thickened walls.  The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is an ixocutis—a gelatinized layer of hyphae lying parallel to the cap surface. The hyphae comprising this layer are 2.8–6.4&nbsp;μm in diameter, smooth, and thin-walled. They are covered with scattered, short pouch-like outgrowths. The cuticle of the stem is a layer of parallel, vertically oriented hyphae; the hyphae measure 3.5–4.2&nbsp;μm, and are smooth, slightly thick-walled, and pale yellowish-brown in [[alkali]]ne solution. They give rise to a covering of tangled and branched caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that have multiple [[septum|septa]]. The caulocystidia are 2.8–4.8&nbsp;μm in diameter, smooth, thin walled, and shaped like contorted cylinders. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of all tissues.<ref name="urlHalling"/>

===Similar species===
''Collybia cirrhata'' is most likely to be confused with the remaining members of ''[[Collybia]]'', which have a similar external appearance. ''[[Collybia tuberosa|C.&nbsp;tuberosa]]'' is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown [[sclerotia]] that resemble apple seeds, while ''[[Collybia cookei|C.&nbsp;cookei]]'' has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange.<ref name="urlKuo"/> Other similar mushrooms include ''[[Baeospora myosura]]'' and species of ''[[Strobilurus (fungus)|Strobilurus]]'',<ref name="Trudell2009" /> but these species only grow on [[pine cone]]s.

Like all species remaining in the genus ''Collybia'', ''C.&nbsp;cirrhata'' is [[saprobic]], and is typically found growing on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms;<ref name="urlKuo"/> occasionally the fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms,<ref name=Dimou2008/> although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue—possibly from a previous season—has decayed to such an extent that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate.<ref name=Hughes2001/> Known hosts include ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'', ''[[Russula]]'', ''[[Meripilus giganteus]]'', and ''[[Bovista dermoxantha]]''.<ref name=Kasuya2009/><ref name=Hughes2006/>

''Collybia cirrhata'' is known from [[temperate]], [[subarctic climate|boreal]], and [[alpine climate|alpine]] or [[climate of the Arctic|arctic]] habitats. The fungus is widespread in Europe,<ref name=Bas1995/> including Bulgaria,<ref name=Denchev2010/> Denmark,<ref name="urlSilke-Fladhat"/> Germany,<ref name=Gerhardt1990/> Greece,<ref name=Dimou2008/> Latvia,<ref name="url Latvijas Daba"/> [[Scandinavia]],<ref name=Papetti1999/> Slovakia,<ref name="urlNahuby.sk"/> Switzerland,<ref name=Hughes2006/> Turkey,<ref name=Yagiz2005/> and the United Kingdom.<ref name="urlNBN Gateway: Piggyback Shanklet (Collybia cirrhata) grid map"/> The mushroom is also common in northern [[montane]] regions of North America.<ref name="urlKuo"/> In Asia, the fungus has been reported in Korea,<ref name=Kim1994/> and in [[Hokkaido]], northern Japan. It is also known from [[Greenland]].<ref name=Hughes2006/> A 2009 publication suggested that based on the known evidence, the species' distribution may be [[circumboreal Region|circumboreal]].<ref name=Kasuya2009/>
