==Etymology==
From the Latin words {{lang|la|caerulea}} (blue) and {{lang|la|pes}} (foot).

== Description ==
''Psilocybe caerulipes'' has a [[farinaceous]] taste and a no to slightly farinaceous odor.
*The '''[[Stipe (mycology)|cap]]''' is 1 — 3.5&nbsp;cm in diameter, obtusely [[conic]] to [[wikt:convex|convex]], and the margin is initially turned inwards, later becoming broadly convex to flattened or somewhat [[umbilicate]] while retaining a slight umbo, and at times quite irregular. The surface is [[wikt:viscid|viscid]] when moist from a gelatinous [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]], but soon becomes dry and shiny, translucent-striate, and decorated with fine [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] veil remnants, often with greenish stains near the margin or a greenish tinge overall . It is cinnamon brown to caramel brown when fresh, [[hygrophanous]], and soon fading to dingy [[ochraceous]] buff during dry conditions. The flesh is thin, pliant, bruising blue, sometimes slowly.
*The '''[[Lamella (mycology)|gills]]''' are close but not crowded, narrow with [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] to [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]] to [[wikt:uncinate|uncinate]] attachment. They are nearly white at first, becoming dark brown as the spores mature; the edges are whitish and slightly fimbriate.
*The '''[[spore]]s''' are dark brown, ellipsoid, 7—10  x 4—5 [[μm]] from 4-spored [[basidia]], thick-walled, and with a broad germ pore. The spores from 2-spored basidia are larger.
*The '''[[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]''' is 3–6&nbsp;cm long, 1.5–3&nbsp;mm thick, equal to enlarging downwards, tough(ropey), and is whitish to brown at first. The stipe is pallid to bluish when dried, becoming dingy brown towards the base with age, and bruises blue, sometimes slowly. The surface is powdered at the apex, and covered with whitish to grayish [[fibril]]s downwards. The flesh is stuffed with a [[pith]] and is solid at first but becomes hollow. It lacks an [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]] but sometimes remnants of the thin cortinate partial veil form a soon disappearing [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] annular zone in the upper region of the stem.
*'''Microscopic features''': The [[basidium|basidia]] are 2- and 4-spored. [[pleurocystidium|Pleurocystidia]] are absent. The [[cheilocystidia]] are 18—35 x 4.5—7.5 [[μm]], langeniform (swollen at the base, narrowed at the top), and with a thin neck, sometimes forked, 1–2.5 [[μm]] broad at apices.<ref name=SmithandSinger1958>Singer R, Smith AH.

''Mycologia'' '''50'''(2): 262-303.</ref>

==Habitat==
''Psilocybe caerulipes'' may be found growing solitary to cespitose, in [[deciduous]] forests on hardwood slash and debris, plant matter, on or about decaying hardwood logs, [[birch]], [[beech]] and [[maple]].

==Season==
''Psilocybe caerulipes'' grows from late May through December.

==Distribution==
''Psilocybe caerulipes'' grows in eastern North America, from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[North Carolina]], and west to [[Michigan]]. It has also been found as far south as [[Mexico]] in the states of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and [[Veracruz]].<ref name="SmithandSinger1958" /><ref>Guzmán G. (1973). Some distributional relationships between Mexican and United States mycofloras. ''Mycologia'' '''65''': 1319-1330.</ref>  In Mexico it is found in cloud forests on [[Beech|Fagus]].  It is often overlooked as just another [[little brown mushroom]], and although widely distributed, it is not found often. It is sometimes confused with the larger ''[[Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata]]''.
