'''''Amanita vaginata''''', commonly known as the '''grisette''' or the '''grisette amanita''',<ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> is an [[edible mushroom]] in the fungus family [[Amanitaceae]], but must be thoroughly cooked to destroy its toxins. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is gray or brownish, {{convert|5|to|10|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} in diameter, and has furrows around the edge that duplicate the gill pattern underneath. Unlike many other ''[[Amanita]]'' mushrooms, ''A.&nbsp;vaginata'' lacks a ring on the stem.

''A. vaginata'' is widely distributed in Europe and North America. It is not recommended for consumption due to the possibility of confusing it with related [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species.

== Description ==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|3 to 10|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} in diameter and gray to grayish-brown in color; initially the cap is oval, then as it matures it becomes progressively conical, convex, and eventually flattened, sometimes with a small umbo (a rounded elevation in the center of the cap).<ref name=Arora1986>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/288/mode/2up |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=288–289}}</ref> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white, free (not attached to the stem) to narrowly attached, moderately crowded together, and sometimes have a grayish tint; the lamellulae (small gills that run from the edge of the cap towards the stem) are truncate.<ref name=Jenkins1986>{{cite book |author=Jenkins D.B. |title=''Amanita'' of North America |publisher=Mad River Press |location=Eureka, Calif |year=1986 |page=71 |isbn=0-916422-55-0}}</ref> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white and thin, and does not change color upon bruising.

The stem surface is covered with a finely powdered bloom (pruinose), especially near the top; faint longitudinal lines may be seen.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Amanita vaginata" /> The base of the stem is enclosed in a loose, sack-like [[volva (mycology)|volva]] that may discolor grayish or reddish brown.<ref name="urlAmanita vaginata (MushroomExpert.Com)" /> The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=539}}</ref>

The variant ''A.&nbsp;vaginata'' var. ''alba'' is pure white, and has a volva that is either absent, or not constricted around the base of the stem.<ref name="urlAmanita vaginata var. alba Gillet">{{cite web |url=http://www.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/vagialba.html |title=''Amanita vaginata'' var.

=== Microscopic features ===
The [[basidiospore|spores]] are roughly spherical, 8–12&nbsp;[[μm]] in diameter, thin-walled, and [[nonamyloid]] (that is, not absorbing iodine stain in [[Melzer's reagent]]).<ref name= Healy2008/> The pileipellis (cap cuticle) is composed of filamentous interwoven [[hypha]]e, 2–7&nbsp;μm diameter, gelatinized. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are 36–52 by 4–13&nbsp;μm, 4–sterigmate, without [[clamp connection|clamps]]. The volva is largely made of filamentous hyphae, 2–8&nbsp;μm diameter, inflated cells broadly elliptic, elliptical, fusiform, to clavate, 40–85 by 10–35&nbsp;μm, mostly terminal. The stem [[trama (mycology)|tissue]] is made up of filamentous hyphae with diameters of 2–6&nbsp;μm; the inflated cells are terminal, club-shaped, longitudinally oriented, with dimensions of up to 289 by 31&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Jenkins1986/>

A [[mycorrhiza]]l species, ''A. vaginata'' grows singly or numerous in both [[conifer]]ous and [[hardwood]] forests.

== Ecology ==
One field guide notes that cows enjoy eating this mushroom.<ref name="isbn0-271-02891-2" />

== Edibility ==
Although not poisonous, most authors advise against consumption due to the possibility of mistaking it with poisonous species of ''Amanita''.<ref name="Healy2008" /><ref name="isbn0-88192-586-1">{{cite book |author=Hall I.R. |title=Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms of the World |publisher=Timber Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-88192-586-1 |location=Portland, Or}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=yqHA_M7BVRcC&dq=amanita+vaginata&pg=PA136 Google Books]</ref><ref name="urlRogers Mushrooms | Mushroom Pictures & Mushroom Reference">{{cite web |author=Phillips R |title=Rogers Mushrooms &#124; Mushroom Pictures & Mushroom Reference |url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5563.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518043020/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5563.asp |archive-date=2008-05-18 |access-date=2009-07-30 |publisher=Rogers Plants Ltd.}}</ref>
