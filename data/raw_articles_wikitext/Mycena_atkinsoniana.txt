'''''Mycena atkinsoniana''''' is a species of [[agaric]] fungus in the family [[Mycenaceae]]. It is one of the so-called "bleeding mycenas" that will ooze yellow to orange juice when injured. Other distinguishing features include the upper [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] surface that is decorated with tiny purplish-brown fibers, and the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], which are pale yellow with [[maroon (color)|maroon]] edges. The reddish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] are smooth with a grooved margin, and up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. ''Mycena atkinsoniana'' is known from the United States and Canada, where it grows scattered or in groups on [[leaf litter]] in forests during the summer and autumn. It was originally described from collections associated with [[beech]], but it is also frequently found under eastern North American [[oak]]s.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1935 as ''Mycena fagicola'' by American mycologist [[Alexander H. Smith]], based on specimens that he collected the previous year in [[Cross Village, Michigan]].<ref name="Smith 1935"/> The naming, however, was [[Correct name (botany)|illegitimate]], as it had been previously used by [[Camille Grognot]] (as ''Mycena fagicola'' Grogn. apud [[Casimir Roumeguère|Roumeguère]] published in 1885<ref name="Roumeguere 1885"/>), so Smith changed the [[botanical name|specific epithet]] to ''atkinsoniana'' in his 1947 [[monograph]] on North American ''Mycena'' species.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> Smith credited [[George Francis Atkinson]] with one of the early collections of the fungus in his 1935 species description.<ref name="Smith 1935"/> ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus]] agreed with Smith's decision to change the epithet, concluding that although Grognot's name was a ''[[nomen nudum]]'' (written without an adequate description), he conceded that "the possibility cannot be excluded that one day some overlooked 19th century booklet or exsiccatum will turn up containing a description".<ref name="MaasGeesteranus 1992"/>

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|1|–|30|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} broad, initially obtuse to convex, later becoming broadly [[umbo (mycology)|umbonate]]. Eventually the cap flattens, sometimes with the disc (the central region of the cap) slightly depressed. The cap margin initially touches the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]; as it expands it becomes somewhat wavy. The extreme margin is marked by small lines, grooves or ridges when the cap is moist. The cap is initially covered with white powdery granules, but this later sloughs off to leave a smooth surface. The disc is brownish when young, but soon develops reddish tones; older specimens are [[bay (color)|bay]] to [[Isabelline (colour)|Isabella]], with lighter-colored margins. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is [[buff (color)|buff]]-colored, and oozes an orange-yellow juice when cut. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an [[adnation|adnate]] attachment to the stem. They have a close to moderately crowded spacing, with between 23 and 26 gills reaching the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The gills are narrow to moderately broad, [[chamoisee]] when young, somewhat darker in age, with edges that are [[maroon (color)|maroon]], and either crenulate (finely scalloped) or even. The stem is {{convert|2|–|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, 2–3&nbsp;mm thick, and more or less equal in width throughout. The stem base is rooted among the leaves and debris, and the base is covered with short stiff hairs pressed flat against the surface. Its surface is covered sparsely with minute purplish brown fibrils. The stem is dull reddish brown overall, but the color fades near the top. When mushroom tissue is cut or injured, it oozes a dull reddish-brown juice or, in old specimens, a dull orange juice.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> ''M.&nbsp;atkinsoniana'' mushrooms have no distinctive taste or odor.<ref name="urlKuo"/>

The [[basidiospore|spores]] are narrowly to broadly ellipsoid, [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] ([[staining]] black to blue-black in [[Melzer's reagent]]), and measure 7–9 by 4–5&nbsp;μm. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 28–30 by 6–7&nbsp;μm. [[Cystidia|Cheilocystidia]] are plentiful, and arranged so as to form a sterile band on the edge of the gill. Measuring, they are narrowly [[wikt:fusoid|fusoid]] (tapered at each end), smooth, and have dark reddish contents. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) similar in appearance to the cheilocystidia but far less abundant. Gill tissue is yellowish to very faintly [[wikt:vinaceous|vinaceous]]-brown when stained with [[iodine]]. The tissue of the cap consists of several layers.  The outer surface comprises a thin [[cap cuticle|cuticle]] made of narrow hyphae filled with dark-reddish material. Underlying this layer this is a region of [[wikt:vesiculose|vesiculose]] (swollen like a bladder) cells, while the remainder of the cap tissue consists of narrower woolly hyphae. Both layers of tissue beneath the cuticle will stain very faintly vinaceous-brown in iodine; the stem tissue, in contrast, stains dark [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]-brown in iodine.<ref name="Smith 1947"/>

===Similar species===

The "bleeding" will distinguish ''Mycena atkinsoniana'' from most other ''Mycena'' species commonly encountered. The common and widely distributed ''[[Mycena sanguinolenta|M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta]]'' is another "bleeder", but it is smaller than ''M.&nbsp;atkinsonia'', with a cap diameter ranging from {{convert|3|to|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Additionally, it has distantly spaced gills and a stem that is the same color as the cap, and a dark red juice.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> ''M.&nbsp;atkinsoniana'' is also similar in stature to ''[[Mycena pelianthina|M.&nbsp;pelianthina]]'' (a non-bleeding species),<ref name="Smith 1935"/> but several field characteristics distinguish ''M.&nbsp;pelianthina'', including a radish-like odor and taste, a purplish to lilac-colored cap, and purple-gray gills with dark purple edges.<ref name="Bessette 1995"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
The fungus is [[saprobic]], and so derives nutrients from breaking down dead plant material, such as leaves, bark, needles, and twigs, that has fallen to the ground.<ref name="urlKuo"/> Fruit bodies are usually found growing in groups or scattered on [[leaf litter]] in [[beech]] and beech-[[Tsuga|hemlock]] forests during the summer and autumn,<ref name="urlKuo"/> although it has been recorded growing on lawns.<ref name="Lewis 1984"/> It is also often found under eastern North American [[oak]]s.<ref name="urlKuo"/> The distribution includes the US states [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]],<ref name="Smith 1947"/> and [[Vermont]].<ref name="Bigelow 1966"/> It has also been collected in [[Quebec]], Canada.<ref name="urlMycoQuebec"/>
