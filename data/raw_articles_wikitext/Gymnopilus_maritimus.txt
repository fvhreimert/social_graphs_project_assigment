'''''Gymnopilus maritimus''''' is a fungus species of the family [[Hymenogastraceae]] first collected in northern [[Sardinia]], Italy, in 2006. The species produces moderately sized, sturdy [[mushroom]]s of a reddish-orange colour. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], which can measure up to {{convert|70|mm|in|sigfig=1}} across, is covered in orange [[fibril]]s, and sometimes has small scales. The yellowish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures up to {{convert|110|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in length by {{convert|8|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in width, and sometimes shows remnants of the [[partial veil]]. The mushrooms have thick [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] of a variable colour, ranging from yellow to rust but staining darker, and the yellow [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has a mild taste. The mushrooms leave a rusty-brown [[spore print]], while the spores themselves measure from {{convert|7.5|-|11.5|μm}} in length. The species is most similar in appearance to ''[[Gymnopilus arenophilus|G.&nbsp;arenophilus]]'' and ''[[Gymnopilus fulgens|G.&nbsp;fulgens]]'', but can be differentiated from both [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]]. Despite the similarities, it is not closely related to either, suggesting [[convergent evolution]]. Instead, within the genus ''[[Gymnopilus]]'', it is most closely related to the ''spectabilis–imperialis'' [[cladistics|clade]]. However, it is not particularly similar to any of its closest relatives.

The species has been found only on coastal [[sand dune]]s near [[Olbia]], in Sardinia, where it was observed growing at the base of ''[[Juncus maritimus]]'' (the sea rush), between the winter months of October and January. However, there is speculation that it may also grow elsewhere in Europe. Mushrooms were seen growing from both the sandy soil and decaying plants; however, as a [[saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic feeder]], it is possible that the species would be able to grow on other [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]]. The mushrooms grow in close groups or tight tufts.

Within the genus ''Gymnopilus'', it is located in the [[subgenus]] ''Gymnopilus'' and [[section (botany)|section]] ''Macrospori''.<ref name=p195/> The subgenus ''Gymnopilus'' was proposed by [[Henri Romagnesi]] as ''Cortinatae'' (while the genus was known as ''Fulvidula'') in 1942, though the name ''Gymnopilus'' was given later by [[Rolf Singer]]. The subgenus is characterised by mushrooms that feature either no [[partial veil|veils]], or veils that do not form [[Annulus (mycology)|rings]].

''Gymnopilus maritimus'' mushrooms have a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of between {{convert|15|and|70|mm|in|sigfig=1}} in width that is convex to flattened-convex in shape. There is sometimes a broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], and in older specimens, the cap is depressed in the centre. The margin of the cap is somewhat wavey. The cap surface is dry and dull, coloured red to red-orange, and yellow towards the margin. It is covered in fibrils of an orange colour, and sometimes has minute scales. The dried cap turns blackish-red when [[potassium hydroxide]] is applied.<ref name=p198>Guzmán-Dávalos ''et al''. 2009, p. 198.</ref> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|35|to|110|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in length by {{convert|4|to|8|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in width. It is attached centrally to the cap, and is either completely cylindrical, with equal thickness throughout its length, or slightly narrower towards the base, where whitish or cream [[mycelia]] are sometimes visible. It is dry, with fibres and furrows. It is a yellowish colour, bruising reddish brown.<ref name=p199/> Traces of the [[partial veil]] are sometimes visible on the stem, though it does not form a ring.<ref name="p10">Contu and Vizzini 2009, p. 10. <!-- Stipite confluente, cilindrico, a volte atteniato verso la base, secco, fibrillose-striolato, giallo con sfumature ruggine.

It dries dark brown. There is no distinctive odour, and the taste is mild or slightly bitter.<ref name=p199>Guzmán-Dávalos ''et al''. 2009, p. 199.</ref> The thick [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] can be adnate (connected to the stem by the entire depth of the gill) or sinuate (wavy, with the gills becoming shallower than deeper). They are subdistant (neither close nor distant) and swollen in the middle. In colour, they are yellow in the youngest mushrooms, turning an ochre-orange, while the oldest mushrooms they are [[Rust (color)|rust]]. The gill edges are paler than the faces, and the gills stain orange-brown or darker.<ref name=p198/> No reference is made in the original description to the [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushrooms.<ref>Guzmán-Dávalos ''et al.'' 2009.</ref>

===Microscopic characteristics===
''Gymnopilus maritimus'' leaves a rusty-brown [[spore print]]. The [[basidiospore]]s can measure {{convert|7.5|-|11.5|μm}} in length, though the typical range is {{convert|8|-|10.5|μm}}. In width, they typically measure {{convert|5.5|-|7.5|μm}}, but they can be up to 8&nbsp;μm wide. In shape, they are [[ellipsoid]] or sometimes broadly ellipsoid. The top of the spore (the side where it was once attached to the [[sterigma]], the connection between the basidium and the spore) is rounded and blunt. The spores are covered with fairly large warts, measuring from {{convert|0.5|-|2|μm}} from the main spore in height. There is no [[germ pore]] or [[Plage (mycology)|plage]], and there is no clear depression around the hilum (the area where the spore was attached to the sterigma). The spores turn an orange-yellow to orange-brown colour in [[potassium hydroxide]], and turn reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent and in Lugol's iodine, but they are not [[metachromatic]].<ref name=p199/>

The four-spored [[basidia]] typically measure {{convert|24|-|35|μm}} in length by {{convert|7|-|9|μm}} in width, but can be as much as 10.5&nbsp;μm wide. They are club-shaped, but narrower in the middle. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent) and yellow to yellowish brown. The sterigmata are between 1.6 and 7&nbsp;μm long.<ref name=p199/> The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the edge of the gill) are typically 30 to 42 (though sometimes as much as 50)&nbsp;μm long by {{convert|6|-|10.5|μm}} wide. They are shaped like a [[hip-flask|flask]] or [[wine-skin]]. The top of the cell suddenly widens, and the cell as a whole is thin-[[cell wall|walled]], hyaline and yellowish, and sometimes appears to contain small grains.<ref name=p199/> The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) can be found in tufts at the top of the stem, and measure from {{convert|24|-|60|μm}} by {{convert|3|-|9|μm}}. They are cylindrical, or narrowly flask-shaped, sometimes with a long neck. They are, again, yellow and hyaline.<ref name=p200>Guzmán-Dávalos ''et al''. 2009, p. 200.</ref>

The yellowish [[hyphae]] are between 15 and 13.5&nbsp;μm wide with a wall of variable thickness. There are [[clamp connections]] at the [[septum|septa]] (the walls dividing individual hypha cells). The flesh in the cap is radial, and is made up of yellowish hyphae of between 2.4 and 20&nbsp;μm wide. The [[pileipellis]], the outermost layer of hyphae, forms a [[Trichoderm#Cutis|cutis]], and on older specimens (and on the small scales) forms a [[Trichoderm#Trichoderm|trichoderm]].<ref name=p200/>

===Similar species===

There are five species similar in appearance to ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'': ''[[Gymnopilus arenophilus|G.&nbsp;arenophilus]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus decipiens|G.&nbsp;decipiens]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus flavus|G.&nbsp;flavus]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus fulgens|G.&nbsp;fulgens]]'' and ''[[Gymnopilus pseudofulgens|G.&nbsp;pseudofulgens]]''. ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' and particularly ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' are the most similar.<ref name=p202>Guzmán-Dávalos ''et al''. 2009, p. 202.</ref><ref name=p12/> Though ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' and ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' show similarities in their [[biogeography]] and [[ecology]], the typically slightly smaller ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' differs from ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]]. While ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' has a cap covered in fibrils with small scales, ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' can sometimes be completely smooth, and spore ornamentation differs, with ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' typically displaying larger warts.<ref name=p202/> Like ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'', ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' has been recorded growing on sand-dune [[heathland]]; further, the spores are similar in appearance to those of ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''. However, ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' requires soil rich in [[peat]] and must grow among moss. Moreover, there are a number of morphological differences; ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' mushrooms are larger and thicker, there are never remains of the partial veil on ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' stems, the shape of the top of the spores differs between the two species, and the cheilocystidia and caulocystidia are significantly larger on ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''. ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' [[variety (botany)|var.]] ''luteicystis'' is even more distinct from ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' than the nominate variety.<ref>Guzmán-Dávalos ''et al.'' 2009, pp. 202–3.</ref> Despite the similarities between the three species, the three have been shown to be in different [[cladistics|clades]] within ''Gymnopilus'', suggesting ecological [[convergent evolution|convergence]] between ''G.&nbsp;arenophilus'' and ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'', and morphological convergence between ''G.&nbsp;fulgens'' and ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''.<ref name=p203/>

''Gymnopilus flavus'', despite also appearing on land near the [[Mediterranean]], can be differentiated from ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'' as it lives among grass, especially ''[[Dactylis glomerata]]'', and it has distinctly smaller spores, typically measuring 5 to 6 by 3.5 to 4.2&nbsp;μm.<ref name=p203>Guzmán-Dávalos ''et al''. 2009, p. 203.</ref> ''G.&nbsp;pseudofulgens'', also collected in Italy, shows two major morphological differences: it produces smaller mushrooms, and spores that are of a different shape with smaller warts. ''G.&nbsp;decipiens'', another species that grows on sandy soil, again has spores that are markedly different.<ref name=p203/> The American species ''[[Gymnopilus arenicola|G. arenicola]]'' also favours sandy soil, but has significantly smaller spores than ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''. Two other species of ''Gymnopilus'' found around the Mediterranean are ''[[Gymnopilus corsicus|G.&nbsp;corsicus]]'' and ''[[Gymnopilus spadiceus|G.&nbsp;spadiceus]]''. ''G.&nbsp;corsicus'' has no veil remnants on the stem, and spores that do not turn red in Melzer's reagent or Lugol's iodine, and so can easily be differentiated from ''G.&nbsp;maritimus''. ''G.&nbsp;spadiceus'' shows several similarities to ''G.&nbsp;maritimus'', but grows only on pine wood and has rectangular spores.<ref name=p203/>

''Gymnopils maritimus'' is clearly a different species from other members of its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; in the case of ''G.&nbsp;junonius'' and ''G.&nbsp;spectabilis'' (often considered synonymous), as well as ''G.&nbsp;pampeanus'', they are narrower, and in the case of ''G.&nbsp;imperialis'', they are wider. Of the other members of the clade, only ''G.&nbsp;junonius'' and ''G.&nbsp;spectabilis'' also grow in Europe.<ref name=p203/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Gymnopilus maritimus'' is known only from a single site in [[Pittulongu]], an area of [[Olbia]], in [[Sardinia]], Italy, which is the [[Type locality (biology)|type locality]]. There, mushrooms were found growing in close groups and tufts on coastal [[sand dunes]] around {{convert|10|m|ft}} from the [[high tide]] line.<ref name=p200/> They were observed at the base of live ''[[Juncus maritimus]]'' (sea rush) plants, growing on sandy soil or decaying plants,<ref name=p200/> where they were feeding as [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophs]]. As such, it is possible that the species would be able to grow on other [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]].<ref name="p202"/> They were observed growing from autumn to winter,<ref name=p12>Contu and Vizzini 2009, p. 12. <!-- gregario, a volte anche cespitoso, in terreno sabbioso costiero alla base di arbusti viventi di Juncus maritimus, vicino al mare. Autunno e inverno. Conosciuto solo dalla Sardegna. --></ref> between the end of October and January.<ref name=p200/> In addition to the collections in Sardinia, Contu and Vizzini speculate that reports of ''G. fulgens'' growing in "sand-dune heaths" on Great Britain, an unusual habitat for that species, may in fact show the presence of ''G. maritimus'' on the island.<ref name=p12/>
