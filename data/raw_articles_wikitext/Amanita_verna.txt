'''''Amanita verna''''', commonly known as the '''fool's mushroom'''  or the '''spring destroying angel''' (see [[destroying angel]]),<ref name=NGSWG>{{Cite web| website=National General Status Working Group| date=2015| title=Standardized Common Names for Wild Species in Canada|url=https://search.wildspecies.ca/#/species-profile?code=GS013539&year=2015}}</ref> is a deadly [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]], one of many in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. Occurring in [[Europe]] in spring, ''A. verna'' [[Mycorrhiza|associates]] with various deciduous and coniferous trees. The [[Pileus (mycology)|caps]], [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]s and [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s are all white in colour.

==Taxonomy==
''Amanita verna'' was first mentioned in the scientific literature by French mycologist  [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Jean Bulliard]] in 1780 as [[form (botany)|form]] ''vernus'' of ''Agaricus bulbosus''. Bulliard warned that it could be easily confused with the edible field mushroom (''[[Agaricus campestris]]''), and that remedies for those who had eaten it included putting [[Diethyl ether|vitriolic ether]] in wine or crushed garlic in milk.<ref name="Bulliard 1780"/> The species name ''verna'' is derived from the Latin word for "spring". Three years later, [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] gave it distinct species status in his ''Encyclopédie Méthodique, Botanique''.<ref name="Lamarck 1783"/>

''A. verna'' is a close relative of ''[[Amanita phalloides|A. phalloides]]'' (the death cap); both species belong to the ''[[Amanita]]'' subfamily Phalloideae.

==Description==
The fool's mushroom is pure white, all the way to the gills and the stipe.<ref>{{cite web |title=This month's fungus is the death angel, Amanita bisporigera, Amanita virosa, and Amanita verna |url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/sept97.html |access-date=December 27, 2012}}</ref> This fungus, like many but not all amanitas, has a [[Volva (mycology)|volva]]. The fool's mushroom's cap is {{convert|5|-|10|cm|0|abbr=off}} wide, and is about the same height.

This mushroom's lamellae are free and white, and the volva is bag-like and large. Its [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]] is white and membranous, and ''A. verna'' react yellow with 20% [[potassium hydroxide]] solution, unlike its relative ''[[Amanita phalloides var. alba]]'' while ''[[Amanita virosa]]'' gets an orange-yellow reaction. The mushroom's spores are smooth and elliptical.<ref name="Kinoko-Ya_MrMushrooms_Amanitaverna">{{cite web |last=Takahashi |first=Hiroshi |title=Amanita verna |url=http://kinoko-ya.sakura.ne.jp/01eng3/amanita_verna.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722115233/http://kinoko-ya.sakura.ne.jp/01eng3/amanita_verna.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 22, 2011 |access-date=2009-11-04 |language=en, ja }}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The fool's mushroom grows in European woodlands and hardwood forests in springtime as the fungus' Latin name (Amanita verna or spring destroying angel) suggests.<ref name=Kinoko-Ya_MrMushrooms_Amanitaverna/>

Unlike various closely related poisonous amanitas, this mushroom is not known to occur in [[North America]].

==Toxicity==
Closely related to other deadly pure white amanitas, the fool's mushroom is one of the most poisonous mushrooms in the world. Just like the death cap, this organism contains  a fatal dose of [[alpha-amanitin]], which causes liver failure if not treated immediately. While this mushroom (along with many other deadly and edible fungi) also contains [[phallotoxins]], these phallotoxins are not toxic to humans (when ingested) as they are poorly absorbed.

This mushroom's toxicity and symptoms are similar, if not identical to that of the death cap. Like other members of the subfamily Phalloideae, the fool's mushroom has been implicated in a number of serious or fatal poisonings.

There are no negative symptoms from eating this fungus until 6–24 hours after ingestion. The first symptom is simply unease. Violent cramps and diarrhea follow. On the third day, the same symptoms repeat themselves, but while to many this may seem like a sign of recovery, most of the time it is simply a herald of the final onset of symptoms, which include kidney and liver failure due to amatoxins. At this point, drastic measures like liver transplants need to be taken, or the victim would most likely die.<ref name=UWisc_DepartmentofBotany_TomsFungi_Sep1997>{{cite web|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/sept97.html|title=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for September 1997|last=Volk|first=Tom|date=1997-09-01|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]]|access-date=2009-11-04}}</ref>
