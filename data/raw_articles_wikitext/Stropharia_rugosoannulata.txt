It is regarded as a choice [[edible mushroom|edible]].

== Etymology ==
The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]], which means "wrinkled-ringed", is a reference to the wrinkled [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]] of the fruiting body.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |author=Pacioni G |title=Simon & Schusters Guide to Mushrooms |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1981 |isbn=0-671-42849-7}}</ref>

== Description ==
The mushroom can grow to {{Convert|20|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} high with a reddish-brown convex to flattening cap up to {{Convert|30|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} across,<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sisson |first=Liv |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/on1372569849 |title=Fungi of Aotearoa: a curious forager's field guide |last2=Vigus |first2=Paula |date=2023 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-1-76104-787-9 |location=Auckland, New Zealand |pages=138 |oclc=on1372569849}}</ref> the size leading to another colloquial name '''godzilla mushroom'''.<ref name="Carluccio03">{{cite book | author = Carluccio A | author-link = Antonio Carluccio | year = 2003 | title = The Complete Mushroom Book | publisher = Quadrille | isbn = 1-84400-040-0}}</ref> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are typically adnate, initially pale, then grey and finally dark purple-brown in colour. The [[spore print]] is dark purple-brown to black.<ref name="Arora1986" />

The firm [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, as is the tall [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], which bears a wrinkled ring.<ref name=":0" />

=== Similar species ===
It can resemble some members of its genus, such as ''[[Stropharia hornemannii|S.&nbsp;hornemannii]]'', as well as ''[[Agaricus]]'' (the gills of which are usually more pink).<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=688-689}}</ref><ref name="Arora1986" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is found on wood chips across North America in summer and autumn.<ref name="audu" /> It is also found in Europe, and has been introduced to Australia and New Zealand. 

== Ecology ==
[[Paul Stamets]]'s book ''[[Mycelium Running]]'' cites a study by Christiane Pischl showing that the species makes an excellent garden companion to [[corn]]. The fungus also has a history of being grown with corn in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2025}}

A 2006 study, published in the journal ''Applied and Environmental Microbiology'', found the species to have [[Nematophagous fungus|the ability]] to attack the [[nematode]] ''[[Panagrellus redivivus]]''; the fungus produces unique spiny cells called [[Acanthocyte (mycology)|acanthocyte]]s, which are able to immobilise and digest the nematodes.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hong Luo |author2=Xuan Li |author3=Guohong Li |author4=Yanbo Pan |author5=Keqin Zhang |name-list-style=amp |year=2006 |title=Acanthocytes of Stropharia rugosoannulata Function as a Nematode-Attacking Device |journal=Appl.
