'''''Hericium cirrhatum''''' is a [[saprotroph]]ic [[fungus]], commonly known as the '''tiered tooth fungus''' or '''spine face'''.<ref name="petetosvn"/><ref name="umg">[https://ultimate-mushroom.com/edible/287-hericium-cirrhatum.html The Ultimate Mushroom Guide]</ref> The species is edible and good eating<ref name="petetosvn">{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms|year=2006 |publisher= |location=Macmillan |isbn=0-330-44237-6 |page=327}}</ref> when young. It has a texture not unlike tender meat or fish. The flesh is cream in colour with an attractive smell when young, but it develops a very unpleasant odour in older specimens.<ref name="ftne"/><ref name="umg"/> 

==Appearance==
The appearance of the fruit body is bracket-like, but without a stem and usually the spines are hang in tiers like icicles.<ref name="petetosvn"/> The upper surface is often rough with sterile spines and scales present.<ref name="petetosvn"/> DNA analysis places it in the order Russulales.<ref name="umg"/> Each tier can be 5 to 10cms across and 2 to 3cms thick with spines a little over 1cm long.<ref name="umg"/> It tends to occur for only a couple of years at any given site.<ref name="umg"/>

''Hericium cirrhatum'' can be mistaken for ''[[Hydnum rufescens]]'' or ''[[Hydnum repandum]]'', however these species have a cap that is smooth. ''[[Hericium erinaceus]]'' is another Red Data List species with a more obviously spherical fruiting body and it has much longer spines.<ref name="umg"/>

===Etymology===
The generic name 'Hericium', refers to the fertile spines found in this group and means 'pertaining to a hedgehog'. These spines also gave rise to the species name 'cirrhatum' that translates as 'having tendrils'.<ref name="ftne"/> 

==Habitat & distribution==

''Hericium cirrhatum'' grows on dead standing [[hardwood]] trees, fallen wood or tree stumps of species such as beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'') in old established deciduous woodlands. It has also been recorded on sycamore ''[[Acer pseudoplatanus]]'', birch ''[[Betula]]'' spp., ash ''[[Fraxinus]]'' spp., oak ''[[Quercus robur]]'' and elm ''[[Ulmus]]'' spp.<ref name="petetosvn"/><ref>[http://www.basidiochecklist.info/DisplayResults.asp?intGBNum=16988 Checklist of the British and Irish Basidiomycota]</ref> and is found from July to November in Britain.<ref name="ftne">[https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/hericium-cirrhatum.php First Nature]</ref> It is vulnerable but was removed from the Red Data List in 2006.<ref name="petetosvn"/>  As a rare species it is not illegal to pick the fruiting bodies however consideration should be taken to quantity collected to help preserve.<ref name="bms">{{cite web |url=https://www.britmycolsoc.org.uk/field_mycology/conservation/red-data-list |title=Red Data List of Threatened British Fungi |website=britmycolsoc.org.uk |access-date=2025-02-15}}</ref>

The NBN Database lists only 176 records in Britain of which only 11 are confirmed and none are shown in Scotland although the photographed specimens were found in [[Kilmaurs]], [[East Ayrshire]].<ref>[https://species.nbnatlas.org/species/BMSSYS0000008012 NBN Atalas]</ref> It is nowhere common, but records show it to be present in southern England, particularly in the [[New Forest]] and in some parts of central and southern mainland Europe.<ref name="ftne" />
