'''''Geastrum pectinatum''''' is a species of fungus in the [[Geastrales|earthstar family]]. It is [[common name|commonly known]] as the '''beaked earthstar''' or the '''beret earthstar''', in reference to the shape of the [[spore]] sac and its prominent, protruding peristome.

Although young specimens are spherical, [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] development involves the outer layer of tissue splitting open like a star into 7 to 10 pointed rays that eventually bend back to point downward, revealing a small spore sac, {{convert|1 to 2.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} broad. The spore sac is supported by a small radially wrinkled stalk. There is a distinct conical opening (peristome) at the top of the spore sac that is up to {{convert|8|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} long. The mass of spores and surrounding cells within the sac, the [[gleba]], is dark-brown, and becomes powdery in mature specimens. The spores are spherical, measuring 4 to 6 [[Micrometre|micrometer]]s in diameter, with warts on their surfaces. Like several other earthstars, crystals of [[calcium oxalate]] are present, thought to be involved in fruit body maturation.

''G. pectinatum'' grows on the ground in open woods. Although uncommon, it has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] and has been collected in Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and Africa. It is inedible.

==Taxonomy==

[[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] published the first [[species description|description]] of ''Geastrum pectinatum'' in 1801.<ref name=Persoon1801/> In 1860, [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] described the species ''Geastrum biplicatum'' (originally named ''Geaster biplicatus''),<ref name=Berkeley1860/> based on specimens sent to them by [[Charles Wright (botanist)|Charles Wright]] that he obtained from the [[Bonin Islands]] during the [[North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition]]. Japanese mycologist [[Sanshi Imai]] considered this identical with ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum'' in a 1936 publication.<ref name=Imai1936/> In 1959, mycologist J.&nbsp;T. Palmer reported comparing the original specimen collected by Persoon with fresh samples of what were then thought to be the distinct species ''G.&nbsp;plicatum'' and ''G.&nbsp;tenuipes'' (named by English naturalist Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1838<ref name=Berkeley1839/> and 1848,<ref name=Berkeley1848/> respectively) and concluded the three specimens were [[synonym (biology)|synonymous]]; the original Persoon specimen was then designated as the [[neotype]].<ref name=Palmer1959/>

In Ponce de Leon's [[classification (biology)|classification]] of ''[[Geastrum]]'', he placed the species in the [[subgenus]] ''Geastrum'', [[section (biology)|section]] ''Geastrum'', as the [[type species|type]] of the subsection ''Sulcostomata'', group Pectinatum. Other species in this group—characterized by a determinate peristome surrounded by a groove—are ''[[Geastrum xerophilum|G.&nbsp;xerophilum]]'', and ''[[Geastrum furfuraceum|G.&nbsp;furfuraceum]]''.<ref name=PoncedeLeon1968/> In Stanek's (1958) infrageneric concept, ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum'' is placed in section ''Perimyceliata'' (encompassing species whereby the mycelial layer covers the entire endoperidium), in subsection ''Glabrostomata'', which includes species with plicate peristomes.<ref name=Pilat1958/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''pectinatum'', "like a comb".<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> Its [[common name]]s include the "beaked earthstar" or the "beret earthstar".<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] called it the "comblike shell-puff" in his 1821 "A Natural Arrangement of British Plants".<ref name=Gray1821/>



== Description ==
Immature specimens are {{convert|1 to 2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} across<ref name="Smith1951" /> and roughly spherical. They begin their development submerged in the ground, but gradually emerge with maturity. The young outer surface is covered with [[mycelia]], which forms a soft, fluffy coat that holds soil and debris.<ref name="PoncedeLeon1968" /> The young fruit bodies often have a rounded knob or protuberance.<ref name="Pegler1995" /> Like other members of genus ''[[Geastrum]]'', ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum'' has a [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] wall that is multilayered. At maturity, the outer layer (the exoperidium) splits open from the top in a stellate (star-shaped) manner into 7–9 rays that support the spore sac contained within the inner wall (the endoperidium). The expanded specimens are up to {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} broad and {{convert|6|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} tall.<ref name="SchalkwijkBarendsen1991" /> The rays of the exoperidium bend back (reflex), simultaneously elevating the spore sac above the ground in what is known as the ''fornicate'' condition;<ref name="Smith1982" /> this position exposes the spore sac to more air currents, aiding spore dispersal.<ref name="Evenson1997" /> The surface of the rays often crack to reveal lighter-colored areas, especially along the edges. Together with a well-developed layer of mycelium, the rays are typically bound to fragments of earth or [[forest floor|forest duff]].<ref name="SchalkwijkBarendsen1991" />

The tough and membranous endoperidium comprising the spore sac, purple-brown in color and {{convert|0.5 to 1.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} tall by {{convert|1 to 2.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, is supported by a small stalk—a pedicel—that is {{Convert|3–4|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} long by {{Convert|7–10|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} wide and which has a grooved (sulcate) apophysis, or swelling. This ring-shaped swelling is made of remnants from a tissue called the pseudoparenchymatous layer.<ref name=Dissing1962/> When fresh, the pseudoparenchymatous layer is whitish in color, thick and fleshy; it dries to become brown to dark brown while shrinking and often splitting and peeling.<ref name=Pegler1995/> The endoperidium may be [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]]—covered with fine, white, powder—although the presence of this characteristic has been noted as being somewhat variable.<ref name=Smith1982/><ref name=Esqueda2003/> The spore sac is opened by a single [[wikt:apex|apical]] pore atop a conical "beak", or [[peristome]]. The peristome is ''pectinate''—made of tissue that resembles the teeth of a comb; the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is named after this characteristic. The peristome is {{convert|2 to 5|mm|2|abbr=on}} long, and comprises 20–32 distinct ridges.<ref name=Pegler1995/> The mass of spores and surrounding cells within the sac, the [[gleba]], is dark-brown, and becomes powdery in mature specimens. Internally, the endoperidium contains a structure called the ''columella'' that is narrowly conical in shape, whitish or pale brown, and extends more than halfway into the gleba.<ref name=Pegler1995/> ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum'' has no distinguishable odor or taste;<ref name=Jordan2004/> like other earthstar mushrooms, it is inedible,<ref name="urlRogers"/> and of "no alimentary interest".<ref name=Tynaldo1985/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
The [[spore]]s of ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum'' are brown and opaque.<ref name=Smith1982/> They have a roughly spherical shape<ref name=Baseia2003/> and are ornamented with transparent ([[hyaline]]), truncate warts;<ref name=Smith1951/> the diameter is 4–4.5&nbsp;[[μm]], or 5.5–6.5 if the lengths of the warts is included.<ref name=Dennis1953/> Spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are 2- or 4-spored, while [[cystidia]] (specialized sterile cells that occur at the [[hymenial]] surface in some mushrooms) are absent.<ref name=Jordan2004/> The capillitia—a mass of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores—are light brown and 3–7&nbsp;μm in diameter. They are tapered, thick-walled with a narrow interior, and either smooth or slightly encrusted.<ref name=Pegler1995/>

[[Calcium oxalate]] is a common crystalline compound found in many fungi,<ref name=Whitney1986a/> including the earthstars.<ref name=Horner1983/> The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder on the surface of the spore sac—has been verified for ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum'' using [[scanning electron microscopy]]. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the [[tetragonal]] form, known as [[weddellite]].<ref name=Krisai1986/> A study on the related species ''[[Geastrum saccatum]]'' has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening ([[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]]) of the outer peridial layers.<ref name=Whitney1986b/> The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium.<ref name=Whitney1986b/>

===Similar species===

''Geastrum pectinatum'' has been mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species ''[[Geastrum schmideli|G.&nbsp;schmidelii]]''. The latter species lacks vertical striations on the basal portions of the endoperidium, and does not have a [[pseudoparenchymatous]] collar around the stem.<ref name=Dennis1953/> Another similar species, ''[[Geastrum berkeleyi|G.&nbsp;berkeleyi]]'', has a shorter stem and is missing the ridges at the base of the spore sac.<ref name=Hemmes2002/> Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum''.<ref name=Hemmes2011/> ''[[Geastrum xerophilum|G.&nbsp;xerophilum]]'' also has a dusting of white powder on the surface of the spore sac, but unlike ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum'', consistently lacks a ring at the base of the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum'', the spores of ''G.&nbsp;xerophilum'' are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope.<ref name=Smith1982/> ''[[Geastrum striatum|G.&nbsp;striatum]]'' has smaller fruit bodies than ''G.&nbsp;pectinatum'', and a distinct collar-like apophysis.<ref>Sunhede (1898), p. 426.</ref>

==Habitat and distribution==

This species has been reported to grow solitary or in groups on sandy soil<ref name=Baseia2003/> or rich composted soil<ref name=Smith2005/> in both mixed and [[conifer]]ous forests, often beneath [[Cedrus|cedars]].<ref name=Kibby1994/> In Hawaii, it is usually found growing in [[forest floor|duff]] under coastal ''[[Casuarina]]'' and groves of ''[[Cupressus]]''.<ref name=Hemmes2011/> The species has been noted to occur in late summer and autumn (in Britain and Europe),<ref name=Jordan2004/> but the fruit bodies may dry and persist for some time.<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/>

''Geastrum pectinatum'' has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]]. It has been reported from Australia,<ref name=Herbert1953/> and New Zealand,<ref name=Cunningham1944/> Africa (the Congo<ref name=Dissing1962/> and South Africa)<ref name=Dissing1962/> Central America (Costa Rica),<ref name=Calonge2005/> Asia (Northeastern China<ref name=Wang2004/> and Japan),<ref name=Imai1936/> and South America (Brazil).<ref name=Baseia2003/> In Europe, it has been reported from Belgium,<ref name=Demoulin1968/> Ireland,<ref name=Anderson1994/> Germany,<ref name=Winterhoff1981/> the Netherlands,<ref name=DeVries1985/> Norway,<ref name=Hapnes1990/> and Sweden.<ref name=Kers1975/><ref name=Kers1977/><ref name=Andersson2009/> In the Middle East, it has been recorded in Israel,<ref name=Binyamini1994/> and Turkey.<ref name=Kaya2006/> In North America, it is known from the United States<ref name=Smith1951/> (including Hawaii),<ref name=Smith1982/> Canada,<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> and Mexico.<ref name=Vasquez1990/> It is in the [[Regional Red List|Red Data Book]] (documenting rare and endangered species) of Latvia,<ref name=Vimba1997/> and is considered a [[threatened species]] in Poland.<ref name=Wojewoda2000/> North American sources gives its frequency of appearance as "rare",<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/><ref name=Smith1951/> but Stellan Sunhede, in his 1989 [[monograph]] on the Geastraceae, considers it one of the most common earthstar mushrooms of northern Europe.<ref>Sunhede (1898), p. 294.</ref>
