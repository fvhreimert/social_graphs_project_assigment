'''''Hygrocybe aurantipes'''''  is a [[Agaricales|gilled]] [[fungus]] of the [[Hygrophoraceae|waxcap]] family found in a few scattered locations in wet forests in [[eastern Australia]]. It is a distinctive small [[mushroom]] with a 2–4&nbsp;cm diameter olive-brown [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] and golden-yellow [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and gills, not easily confused with any other species. Known only from [[Lane Cove Bushland Park]] in [[Sydney]]'s suburban [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]], [[Hazelbrook, New South Wales|Hazelbrook]] and [[Mount Wilson, New South Wales|Mount Wilson]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], it has been designated as ''vulnerable'' as defined by the NSW Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016, by the [[New South Wales]] Government.

==Taxonomy==
''Hygrocybe aurantipes'' was originally collected by Ray and Elma Kearney in [[Lane Cove Bushland Park]] in Sydney's suburban [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]] district on 17 June 1990, and officially described by Australian [[mycology|mycologist]] [[Anthony M. Young|Tony Young]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Young AM, Wood AE |year=1997|title=Studies on the Hygrophoraceae (Fungi, Homobasidiomycetes, Agaricales) of Australia |journal= Australian Systematic Botany |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=911–1030 |doi=10.1071/SB96005}}</ref> Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] 'golden-footed' is derived from the [[Latin]] root ''aurant-'' 'gold' and ''pes'' 'foot'.<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| date = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|pages = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref>

==Description==
''Hygrocybe aurantipes'' is a small mushroom with a dark olive [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] 2–4&nbsp;centimetres (¾–1½&nbsp;in) in diameter, initially conical and later flattening to almost flat. The widely spaced thick gills are adnate, and connected by veins on the undersurface of the cap, and are bright orange or yellow. The yellow or orange [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 3–6&nbsp;cm (1⅓–2½&nbsp;in) high and 0.35–0.7&nbsp;cm thick and may taper and be paler at the base. The [[spore print]] is white, the oval to oblong [[basidiospore|spores]] measuring 5.5 x 8.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name=Young88>Young, p. 88</ref> A distinctive mushroom, it is not readily confused with any other species.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Hygrocybe aurantipes'' is a [[saprobic]] species, and is little known with a restricted distribution from the [[Hazelbrook, New South Wales|Hazelbrook]] and [[Mount Wilson, New South Wales|Mount Wilson]] in the Blue Mountains and Sydney Basin (Lane Cove Bushland Park). Fruiting bodies appear in autumn and winter (May to August), in leaf litter and mossy [[Riparian zone|riparian]] areas in rainforest in warm [[temperate]] or [[subtropical]] climates.<ref name=Young92>Young, p. 92</ref>

It is currently listed by the New South Wales Government as ''vulnerable'',<ref name=DECC/> that is "likely to become endangered unless the circumstances and factors threatening its survival or evolutionary development cease to operate" as defined by the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/legislation.aspx |title=NSW Threatened Species Legislation |accessdate=2008-04-16 |work=New South Wales Government – Department of Environment and Climate Change website |archive-date=17 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217034826/http://www.threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/legislation.aspx |url-status=dead }}</ref> Searching of suitable habitat has only yielded a limited occurrence, and its habitat has been deemed vulnerable to waterborne pollution, weed encroachment and damage from pedestrians.<ref name=DECC>{{cite web |author=NSW Scientific Committee |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/HygrocybeAurantipesVulSpListing.htm |title=''Hygrocybe aurantipes'' (an agaric fungus) – vulnerable species listing |accessdate=2008-04-16 |work=New South Wales Government – Department of Environment and Climate Change website |archive-date=16 June 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616152825/http://www3.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/HygrocybeAurantipesVulSpListing.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>
