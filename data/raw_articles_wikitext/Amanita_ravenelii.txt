'''''Amanita ravenelii''''', commonly known as the '''pinecone lepidella''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Amanitaceae]]. The whitish [[Basidiocarps|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) are medium to large, with caps up to {{convert|17|cm|in|1|abbr=off|frac=2|sp=us}} wide, and [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|25|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=2}} long. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] surface has large warts and the stem has a scaly, bulbous base. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the mushrooms is firm, with a distinct [[chlorine]]-like odor.

It is widely distributed in [[mixed forest|mixed]] and [[deciduous forest]]s of the southeastern United States, where it grows solitarily or in groups on the ground in late summer and autumn. It has also been recorded in Mexico and Argentina. It is a [[mycorrhizal]] species, although the plant species with which it tends to associate are not known. Lookalike North American ''[[Amanita]]'' species include ''[[Amanita chlorinosma|A.&nbsp;chlorinosma]]'', ''[[Amanita polypyramis|A.&nbsp;polypyramis]]'', ''[[Amanita mutabilis|A.&nbsp;mutabilis]]'', and ''[[Amanita armillariiformis|A.&nbsp;armillariiformis]]''. Within the genus ''Amanita'', it is part of the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Lepidella''. Guidebooks do not recommend mushrooms of this section as [[edible mushroom|edible]]; they may be [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]].

==Taxonomy==

The species was first [[species description|described scientifically]] in 1859 by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Christopher Edmund Broome]] as ''Agaricus ravenelii''.<ref name="Berkeley1859"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] honors [[Henry William Ravenel]],<ref name="Bessette2007"/> who collected the [[type (biology)|type specimen]] from [[South Carolina]].<ref name="Berkeley1859"/> Berkeley and Broome called it "a very fine species", and compared it to ''[[Amanita strobiliformis]]''.<ref name="Berkeley1859"/> [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] transferred the [[taxon]] to the genus ''[[Amanita]]'' in 1887.<ref name="Saccardo1887"/>

It is in the subsection ''Solitariae'', [[section (biology)|section]] ''Lepidella'' in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''.<ref name="Singer1986"/> Other North American species in the section ''Lepidella'' include ''[[Amanita abrupta|A.&nbsp;abrupta]]'', ''[[Amanita atkinsoniana|A.&nbsp;atkinsoniana]]'', ''[[Amanita chlorinosma|A.&nbsp;chlorinosma]]'', ''[[Amanita cokeri|A.&nbsp;cokeri]]'', ''[[Amanita daucipes|A.&nbsp;daucipes]]'', ''[[Amanita mutabilis|A.&nbsp;mutabilis]]'', ''[[Amanita onusta|A.&nbsp;onusta]]'', ''[[Amanita pelioma|A.&nbsp;pelioma]]'', ''[[Amanita polypyramis|A.&nbsp;polypyramis]]'', and ''[[Amanita rhopalopus|A.&nbsp;rhopalopus]]''.<ref name="Bhatt2004"/>

The fungus is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "pinecone lepidella".<ref name="McKnight1987"/>

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|8|–|17|cm|abbr=off|frac=2|sp=us}} wide, initially hemispherical to almost round, later becoming convex to flattened. It is fleshy, white to yellowish-white, usually dry, but occasionally slightly sticky with age. The [[universal veil]] remains as a pale yellow to brownish-orange layer that breaks up into crowded, rather coarse, conical to truncate-conical warts. The warts are up to {{convert|6|mm|frac=4}} wide and {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} high, becoming more scale-like towards the cap margin with age. The margin is non-striate (without any grooves), and appendiculate (with [[partial veil]] remnants hanging along the cap margin).<ref name="Bhatt2004"/>

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free from attachment to the stem, crowded together, moderately broad, and yellowish-white to pale yellow. Interspersed among the gills are short gills (lamellulae) that do not extend completely to the stem; they are somewhat truncated (abruptly terminated) to attenuated (tapering gradually).<ref name="Bhatt2004"/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|10|–|25|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} long and {{convert|1|–|3|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} wide, and decreases slightly in thickness near the apex. It is solid (i.e., not hollow), white to pale yellow, and covered with tufts of soft woolly hairs or fibrils. It has a large basal bulb, swollen in the middle, which roots in the ground up to {{convert|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=2}}. The partial veil is yellowish-white to pale yellow, forming a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] which is thick, woolly, delicate, and soon falls away. The universal veil remains at the stem base as thick scales, curved downward, often forming irregular rings.<ref name="Bhatt2004"/>

The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, and white to pale yellow. The mushroom tissue has an odor of chlorinated lime ([[bleaching powder]]),<ref name="Bhatt2004"/> [[chlorine]],<ref name="Bessette2018"/> "old tennis shoes",<ref name="Miller2006"/> or "old ham".<ref name="Bessette2018"/>

===Microscopic characteristics===

The [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], occasionally ovoid or [[wikt:obovoid|obovoid]], thin-walled, [[hyaline]], [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 8–11 by 5.5–7.5&nbsp;[[μm]]. The [[spore print|spore deposit]] is white. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are 40–65 by 7–11.5&nbsp;μm, four-spored, with clamps at their bases. [[wikt:cheilocystidium|Cheilocystidia]] ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are occasionally seen as small, club-shaped cells measuring 15–35 by 10–15&nbsp;μm, on thin-walled hyphae that are 3–7&nbsp;μm in diameter. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]], which is not clearly differentiated from the cap tissue, consists of thin-walled, interwoven [[hypha]]e 2.5–9&nbsp;μm in diameter. The tissue of the universal veil on the cap consists of more or less parallel and erect rows of roughly spherical, and ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid cells, up to 78 by 65&nbsp;μm and spindle- to club-shaped cells up to 125 by 30&nbsp;μm. These latter cells are terminal or in short, terminal chains, and are borne on moderately abundant, thin-walled, branched, interwoven, sometimes nearly [[wikt:coralloid|coralloid]] hyphae, 3–9.5&nbsp;μm diameter with a few scattered oleiferous (oil-containing) hyphae, 5–12.5&nbsp;μm diameter. The distribution of hyphae at the stem base is similar to that on the cap, but with more filamentous hyphae. [[Clamp connection]]s are present.<ref name=Bhatt2004/>

[[image:Amanita ravenelii 92431.jpg|thumb|160px|right|The basal bulb is characteristic of ''A.&nbsp;ravenelii''.]]
The fruit bodies of ''A.&nbsp;ravenelii'' are distinguished from ''[[Amanita chlorinosma|A.&nbsp;chlorinosma]]'' by the presence of pale yellow to brownish orange, large, conical to truncate-conical warts on the cap surface and a large basal bulb. The mushroom ''[[Amanita polypyramis|A.&nbsp;polypyramis]]'' is pure white, and lacks the pale yellow to brownish-orange large conical warts typical of ''A.&nbsp;ravenelii''.<ref name=Bhatt2004/> The North American species ''[[Amanita armillariiformis|A.&nbsp;armillariiformis]]'' has a similar [[wikt:areolate|areolate]] cap surface, but unlike ''A.&nbsp;ravenelii'', does not have a distinct basal bulb, and it is found in semi-arid areas associated with [[aspen]] and old growth [[Douglas fir]].<ref name=Miller1990/> Also from North America, ''[[Amanita mutabilis|A.&nbsp;mutabilis]]'' has pink tones on the cap and stem, and will turn pink when its flesh is cut; it smells of [[anise]].<ref name=Miller2006/> Both ''[[Amanita daucipes|A.&nbsp;daucipes]]'' and ''[[Amanita rhopalopus|A.&nbsp;rhopalopus]]'' have differing warts and bulbs.<ref name="Bessette2018"/>

==Distribution and habitat==

''Amanita ravenelii'' is widely distributed in the southeastern United States, where their occurrence is "occasional to frequent" in the late summer and autumn months of August to November.<ref name="Bessette2007"/> Mushrooms have been collected from the US states of [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]], South Carolina, [[Indiana]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]],<ref>Jenkins, 1986, p. 100.</ref> and [[Kentucky]].<ref name="Keller2010"/> It has also been reported growing in northern [[Baja California]], Mexico,<ref name="Ayala1988"/> and in the Argentine provinces of [[Tucumán]], [[Buenos Aires (province)|Buenos Aires]], and [[Rio Negro Province|Rio Negro]].<ref name="Niveiro2012"/>

It is a [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, meaning it forms [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] associations with shrubs and trees.<ref>Jenkins, 1986, pp. 5–6.</ref> Mushrooms grow on the ground solitarily, scattered, or in groups in [[mixed forest|mixed]] coniferous and deciduous forests.<ref name="Bessette2007"/> Although the specific tree associations preferred by ''A.&nbsp;ravenelii'' are unknown, in general, ''Amanita'' from section ''Lepidella'' tend to associate with diploxylon pine (that is, pines in [[Pinus classification|subgenus ''Pinus'']]), [[oak]], and [[hickory]].<ref name="Bhatt2004"/>

==Toxicity==

The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of species in ''Amanita'' subgenus ''Lepidella'' have been described variously as unknown,<ref name="Bessette2007"/> not recommended,<ref name="McKnight1987"/> or [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].<ref name="Miller2006"/>
