'''''Lycoperdon perlatum''''', popularly known as the '''common puffball''', '''warted puffball''', '''gem-studded puffball''' or '''devil's snuff-box''', is a species of [[puffball]] fungus in the family [[Agaricaceae]]. It is a medium-sized puffball with a round [[ascocarp (fungus)|fruit body]] tapering to a wide stalk, and dimensions of {{convert|1.5 to 6|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide by {{convert|3 to 10|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} tall. It is off-white with a top covered in short spiny bumps or "jewels", which are easily rubbed off to leave a netlike pattern on the surface. When mature it becomes brown and a hole in the top opens to release [[spore]]s in a burst when the body is compressed by touch or falling raindrops.



A widespread species with a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], the species grows in fields, gardens, and grassy clearings. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]] when young and the [[gleba|internal flesh]] is completely white, although care must be taken to avoid confusion with immature fruit bodies of [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] ''[[Amanita]]'' species. ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'' can usually be distinguished from similar puffballs by differences in surface texture. Several chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'', including [[sterol]] derivatives, [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] compounds that give the puffball its flavor and odor, and the unusual [[amino acid]] lycoperdic acid. [[Extract]]s of the puffball have [[antimicrobial]] and [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] activities.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] in the scientific literature in 1796 by mycologist [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]].<ref name="Persoon 1796"/> [[Synonym (biology)|Synonyms]] include ''Lycoperdon gemmatum'' (as described by [[August Batsch]] in 1783),<ref name="Batsch 1786"/> the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''L.&nbsp;gemmatum'' var. ''perlatum'' (published by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1829),<ref name="Fries 1829"/> ''L.&nbsp;bonordenii'' ([[George Edward Massee]], 1887),<ref name="Massee 1887"/> and ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'' var. ''bonordenii'' (A.&nbsp;C. Perdeck, 1950).<ref name="Perdeck 1950"/><ref name="urlFungorum synonymy: Lycoperdon perlatum"/><ref name="urlMycoBank: Lycoperdon perlatum"/>

''L.&nbsp;perlatum'' is the [[type species]] of the genus ''Lycoperdon''. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analyses suggest a close [[phylogenetic]] relationship with ''[[Lycoperdon marginatum|L.&nbsp;marginatum]]''.<ref name="Larsson 2008"/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''perlatum'' is [[Latin]] for "widespread".<ref name="Schalkwijk-Barendsen 1991"/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the common puffball, the gem-studded puffball<ref name="Ammirati 1987"/> (or gemmed puffball),<ref name="Arora 1986"/> the warted puffball,<ref name="Schalkwijk-Barendsen 1991"/> or the devil's snuff-box;<ref name="Dickinson 1982"/> [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] called it the pearly puff-ball in his 1821 work ''A Natural Arrangement of British Plants''.<ref name="Gray 1821"/> Because some [[indigenous peoples]] believed that the spores caused blindness, the puffball has some local names such as "blindman's bellows" and "no-eyes".<ref name="Roberts 2011"/>

==Description==
The fruit body ranges in shape from pear-like with a flattened top, to nearly spherical, and reaches dimensions of {{convert|1.5 to 6|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide by {{convert|3 to 9|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} tall.<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |page=189}}</ref> It has a stem-like base, and is whitish before browning in age.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=269–270|language=en}}</ref> The outer surface of the fruit body (the [[exoperidium]]) is covered in short cone-shaped spines that are interspersed with granular warts. The spines, which are whitish, gray, or brown, can be easily rubbed off, and leave [[wikt:reticulate|reticulate]] pock marks or scars after they are removed.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> The base of the puffball is thick. It is initially white, but turns yellow, olive, or brownish in age.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> The reticulate pattern resulting from the rubbed-off spines is less evident on the base.<ref name="Pegler 1995"/>

In maturity, the exoperidium at the top of the puffball sloughs away, revealing a pre-formed hole ([[ostiole]]) in the endoperidium, through which the spores can escape.<ref name="Miller 1988"/> In young puffballs, the internal contents, the [[gleba]], is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the [[spore]]s mature.<ref name="Arora 1986"/>  The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with [[hymenium]] (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature.<ref name="Miller 1988"/> Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore release mechanism in ''L.&nbsp;pyriforme'' using high-speed [[schlieren photography]] determined that raindrops of 1&nbsp;mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100&nbsp;cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact. A single puff like this can release over a million spores.<ref name="Gregory 1947"/>

The spores are spherical, thick-walled, covered with minute spines, and measure 3.5–4.5&nbsp;[[μm]] in diameter. The [[capillitia]] (threadlike filaments in the gleba in which spores are embedded) are yellow-brown to brownish in color, lack [[septae]],<ref name="Miller 2006"/> and measure 3–7.5&nbsp;μm in diameter.<ref name="Pegler 1995"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 7–9 by 4–5&nbsp;μm. The basidia bear four slender [[sterigmata]] of unequal length ranging from 5–10&nbsp;μm long. The surface spines are made of chains of [[pseudoparenchymatous]] [[hypha]]e (resembling the [[parenchyma]]  of higher plants), in which the individual hyphal cells are spherical to elliptical in shape, thick-walled (up to 1&nbsp;μm), and measure 13–40 by 9–35&nbsp;μm.&nbsp;These hyphae do not have [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name="Natarajan 1987"/>

There are several other puffball species with which ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'' might be confused. ''[[Lycoperdon nettyanum|L.&nbsp;nettyanum]]'', found in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States, is covered in granular patches, but these granules adhere more strongly to the surface than those of ''L.&nbsp;perlatum''.<ref name="Ramsey 1980" /> ''[[Lycoperdon pyriforme|L.&nbsp;pyriforme]]'' lacks prominent spines on the surface, and grows on rotting wood—although if growing on buried wood, it may appear to be terrestrial. The widely distributed and common ''[[Lycoperdon umbrinum|L.&nbsp;umbrinum]]'' has spines that do not leave scars when rubbed off,<ref name="Davis 2012" /> a gleba that varies in color from dark brown to purple-brown at maturity, and a purple-tinged base. The small and rare species ''[[Lycoperdon muscorum|L.&nbsp;muscorum]]'' grows in deep moss. ''[[Lycoperdon peckii|L.&nbsp;peckii]]'' can be distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;pyriforme'' by the lavender-tinged spines it has when young. ''[[Lycoperdon rimulatum|L.&nbsp;rimulatum]]'' has purplish spores, and an almost completely smooth exoperidium.<ref name="Arora 1986" /> ''[[Lycoperdon excipuliforme|L.&nbsp;excipuliforme]]'' is larger and grayer, and, in mature individuals, the upper portion of its fruit body breaks down completely to release its spores.<ref name="Roberts 2011" />  In the field, ''[[Lycoperdon marginatum|L.&nbsp;marginatum]]'' is distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'' by the way in which the spines are shed from the exoperidium in irregular sheets.<ref name="Davis 2012" />

==Ecology and distribution==


A [[saprobic]] species, ''Lycoperdon perlatum'' grows solitarily, scattered, or in groups or clusters on the ground. It can also grow in [[fairy ring]]s.<ref name="Dickinson 1982" /> Typical habitats include woods, grassy areas, and along roads.<ref name="Arora 1986" /> It has been reported from ''[[Pinus patula]]'' plantations in [[Tamil Nadu]], India.<ref name="Natarajan 1987" /> The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to a golf ball when viewed from a distance.<ref name="Dickinson 1982" />

A widespread species with an almost [[cosmopolitan distribution]],<ref name="Pegler 1995" /> it has been reported from Africa ([[Kenya]], [[Rwanda]],<ref name="Demoulin 1975" /> [[Tanzania]]<ref name="Maghembe 1984" />), Asia (China,<ref name="Zhishu 1993" /> Himalayas,<ref name="Thind 1982" /> Japan,<ref name="Kasuya 2004" /> southern India<ref name="Natarajan 1987" /> Iran<ref name="Asef 2020" />), Australia,<ref name="Dickinson 1982" /> Europe,<ref name="Jordan 2004" /> New Zealand,<ref name="ChuChou 1983" /> and South America (Brazil).<ref name="Baseia 2005" /> It has been collected from [[subarctic]] areas of [[Greenland]], and [[subalpine zone|subalpine]] regions in [[Iceland]].<ref name="Jeppson 2006" /> In North America, where it is considered the most common puffball species, it ranges from [[Alaska]]<ref name="Orr 1979" /> to Mexico,<ref name="Moreno 2010" /> although it is less common in Central America.<ref name="Garner 1956" />

The puffball [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulates]] [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s present in the soil,<ref name="Ylmaz 2003" /><ref name="Falandysz 2003" /> and can be used as a [[bioindicator]] of [[soil pollution]] by heavy metals and [[selenium]].<ref name="Quinche 1990" /> In one 1977 study, samples collected from grassy areas near the side of an [[interstate highway]] in [[Connecticut]] were shown to have high concentrations of [[cadmium]] and [[lead]].<ref name="McCreight 2003" /> ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'' [[biomass]] has been shown experimentally to remove [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] ions from [[aqueous solution]]s, and is being investigated for potential use as a low-cost, [[renewable resource|renewable]], [[biosorption|biosorptive]] material in the [[Sewage treatment|treatment]] of water and [[wastewater]] containing mercury.<ref name="Sari 2012" />

''Lycoperdon perlatum'' is considered a good [[edible mushroom]] when young, when the gleba is still homogeneous and white.<ref>{{cite book |last=Meuninck |first=Jim |title=Foraging Mushrooms Oregon: Finding, Identifying, and Preparing Edible Wild Mushrooms |date=2017 |publisher=[[Falcon Guides]] |isbn=978-1-4930-2669-2 |page=41}}</ref> They have been referred to as "poor man's sweetbread" due to their texture and flavor. The fruit bodies can be eaten after slicing and frying in batter or egg and breadcrumbs,<ref name="Dickinson 1982"/> or used in soups as a substitute for [[dumpling]]s.<ref name="Kuo 2007"/> As early as 1861, Elias Fries recommended them dried and served with salt, pepper, and oil.<ref name="Laessoe 1994"/> The puffballs become inedible as they mature: the gleba becomes yellow-tinged then finally develops into a mass of powdery olive-green spores. ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'' is one of several edible species sold in markets in the Mexican states of [[Puebla]] and [[Tlaxcala]].<ref name="Lemin 2010"/><ref name="Montoya 2003"/> The fruit bodies are appealing to animals as well: the [[northern flying squirrel]] (''Glaucomys sabrinus'') includes the puffball in their diet of non-[[truffle]] fungi,<ref name="Thysell 1997"/> while the "puffball beetle" ''[[Caenocara subglobosum]]'' uses the fruit body for shelter and breeding.<ref name="Suda 2009"/> [[Nutrition analysis|Nutritional analysis]] indicates that the puffballs are a good source of [[dietary protein|protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[fat]]s, and several [[micronutrient]]s.<ref name="Colak 2009"/> The predominant [[fatty acid]]s in the puffball are [[linoleic acid]] (37% of the total fatty acids), [[oleic acid]] (24%), [[palmitic acid]] (14.5%), and [[stearic acid]] (6.4%).<ref name="Nedelcheva 2007"/>

The immature 'buttons' or 'eggs' of deadly ''[[Amanita]]'' species can be confused with puffballs. This can be avoided by slicing fruit bodies vertically and inspecting them for the internal developing structures of a mushroom, which would indicate the poisonous ''Amanita''. Additionally, amanitas will generally not have "jewels" or a bumpy external surface.<ref name="Marley 2010"/>

The spores' surfaces have many microscopic spines and can cause severe irritation of the lung ([[lycoperdonosis]]) when inhaled.<ref name="MMWR 1994"/><ref name="Strand 1967"/> This condition has been reported to afflict dogs that play or run where the puffballs are present.<ref name="Rubensohn 2009"/><ref name="Buckeridge 2011"/>

==Chemistry==
[[FIle:Lycoperdic acid.png|thumb|Lycoperdic acid is an amino acid known only from ''L.&nbsp;perlatum''.]]

Several [[steroid]] derivatives have been isolated and identified from fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'', including (''S'')-23-hydroxylanostrol, [[ergosterol]] α-endoperoxide, ergosterol 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23''E'')-lanosta-8,23-dien-3β,25-diol. The compounds [[3-Octanone|3-octanone]], [[1-octen-3-ol]], and (''Z'')-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant components of the [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor.<ref name="Szummy 2010"/> Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of [[antimicrobial]] activity against laboratory cultures of the human [[pathogenic bacteria]] ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', with activity comparable to that of the antibiotic [[ampicillin]].<ref name="Ramesh 2010"/> These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against [[Salmonella enterica enterica|''Salmonella enterica'' serovar Typhimurium]], ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium smegmatis]]''.<ref name="Dulger 2005"/> Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] activity against ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Candida tropicalis|C.&nbsp;tropicalis]]'', ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'', ''[[Alternaria solani]]'', ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]'', and ''[[Verticillium dahliae]]''.<ref name="Pujol 1990"/> A 2009 study found ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'' puffballs to contain [[cinnamic acid]] at a concentration of about 14&nbsp;milligrams per kilogram of mushroom.<ref name="Barros 2009"/> The fruit bodies contain the pigment [[melanin]].<ref name="Almendros 1987"/>

The [[amino acid]] lycoperdic acid (chemical name 3-(5(''S'')-carboxy-2-oxotetrahydrofuran-5(''S'')-yl)-2(''S'')-alanine) was isolated from the puffball, and reported in a 1978 publication.<ref name="Lamotte 1978"/> Based on the structural similarity of the new amino acid with (''S'')-[[glutamic acid]], (''S'')-(+)-lycoperdic acid is expected to have [[Receptor antagonist|antagonistic]] or [[agonistic]] activity for the [[glutamate receptor]] in the mammalian [[central nervous system]]. Methods to [[Organic synthesis|synthesize]] the compounds were reported in 1992,<ref name="Kaname 1992"/> 1995,<ref name="Yoshifuji 1995"/> and 2002.<ref name="Makino 2002"/>

==In culture==
The species is popular on postage stamps and has been depicted on stamps from Guinea, Paraguay, Romania, Sierra Leone, and Sweden.<ref name="Moss 1998" />
