'''''Cortinarius austrovenetus''''', alternately known as '''''Dermocybe austroveneta''''' and commonly known as the '''green skin-head''' but also known as '''green dermocybe'''<ref name=deh>{{cite web|url=http://www.deh.gov.au/cgi-bin/species-bank/sbank-treatment2.pl?id=81577|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121127195339/http://www.deh.gov.au/cgi-bin/species-bank/sbank-treatment2.pl?id=81577|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 27, 2012|title=Green Dermocybe|publisher=Species Bank|accessdate=November 25, 2006}}</ref> is an inedible brightly coloured green [[Agaricales|gilled fungus]] that naturally occurs in south eastern [[Australia]].

==Taxonomy==
Initially [[species description|described]] as ''Cortinarius austrovenetus'' by Australian naturalist [[John Burton Cleland]] in 1928, this mushroom along with many other members of the group was separated from the huge genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'', and placed in the newer genus ''[[Dermocybe]]'', commonly called skin-heads, derived from the meaning of their scientific names. However, this genus is often treated as a [[subgenus]] of ''Cortinarius'' only.

In 2007, Bruno Gasparini suggested that ''C.&nbsp;austrovenetus'' is the same species as another ''Cortinarius'' in subgenus ''Dermocybe'', ''[[Cortinarius walkerae|C.&nbsp;walkerae]]''. If this is true, ''C.&nbsp;austrovenetus'' is a later [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] and the name C.&nbsp;walkerae would take precedence.<ref name="Gasparini 2007"/>

==Description==
The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''Cortinarius austrovenetus'' are smooth with a convex or flat [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that can be up to {{convert|16|cm|in|0}} across. The [[biological pigment|pigment]] has been isolated and described as austrovenetin.<ref>Gill M, Gimenez A (1991) Austrovenetin, the principal pigment of the toadstool ''Dermocybe austroveneta''. ''Phytochemistry'' '''30''' 951–955</ref> They have yellowy brown; adnate [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] underneath the cap.

Like most members of the family Cortinariaceae this mushroom has a thin web-like [[partial veil|veil]] (the cortina) protecting the gills in the early stages of growth. Remnants of this veil may be seen (often quite fleetingly) on the mature [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]].

==Distribution and habitat==
Occurring particularly in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]] and typically in [[eucalypt]] forests or woodlands. It may exist in some numbers in [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]] and other eastern Australian states but little research has been conducted.<ref name=deh/>

==Edibility==
The [[edible mushrooms|edibility]] of this mushroom is unknown, and it should be avoided, as some of its close relatives contain lethal toxins.{{cn|date=May 2025}}
