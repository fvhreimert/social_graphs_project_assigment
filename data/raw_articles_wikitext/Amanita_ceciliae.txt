'''''Amanita ceciliae''''', commonly called '''snakeskin grisette''', '''strangulated amanita''', and the '''Cecilia's ringless amanita''',<ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> is a [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. First [[Species description|described]] in 1854 by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Christopher Edmund Broome]], it was given its current name by [[Cornelis Bas]] in 1984. It is characterized by bearing a large [[Basidiocarp|fruit body]] with a brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] {{convert|5|–|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} across. The cap has charcoal-grey patches, which are easily removable. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|7|–|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, white in colour, and there is no [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on it. It is slightly tapered to the top and has irregular cottony bands girdling the base. The [[universal veil]] is grey. [[Spore]]s are white, spherical in shape, non-[[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 10.2–11.7 [[micrometre]]s. The mushrooms are considered [[edible mushroom|edible]], but field guides typically advise caution in selecting them for consumption, due to risks of confusion with similar toxic species. ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae'' is found in woods throughout Europe and North America, where it fruits during summer and autumn.

== Taxonomy and etymology ==
''Amanita ceciliae'' was first [[species description|described]] by Miles Joseph Berkeley, an English cryptogamist and clergyman, and [[Christopher Edmund Broome]], a British mycologist, in 1854. It is placed in the genus ''Amanita'' and [[section (biology)|section]] ''Vaginatae''.<ref name=jenkins/><ref name=tulloss2>{{cite web|last=Tulloss|first=R. E|title=Section ''Vaginatae''|url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?section+Vaginatae|publisher=Amanitaceae.org|access-date=2012-10-17}}</ref> Section ''Vaginatae'' consists of mushrooms with special characteristics – such as the absence of a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and very few [[clamp connection]]s at the bases of the [[basidia]].<ref name=tulloss2/>

The name ''Amanita inaurata'', given by Swiss mycologist [[Louis Secretan]] in 1833, has also been used for this species. In 1978, the name was declared nomenclaturally incorrect according to the rules of International Code of Botanical Nomenclature.<ref name=miller>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Orson K.|author2=Laursen, Gary A.|author3= Farr, David F.|title=Notes on Agaricales from Arctic Tundra in Alaska|journal=Mycologia|year=1982|volume=74|issue=4|pages=576–91|doi=10.2307/3792745|url=http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59350/0074/004/0576.htm|jstor=3792745|url-access=subscription}}</ref> Other [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]] are ''Agaricus ceciliae'', ''Amanitopsis inaurata'' and ''Amanitopsis ceciliae''.<ref name="IndexFungorum"/> The present name, ''Amanita ceciliae'', was given by [[Cornelis Bas]], a Dutch mycologist, in 1984.<ref name=jenkins>{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=David T.|title=''Amanita'' of North America|year=1986|publisher=Mad River Press|location=Eureka|isbn=0-916422-55-0|pages=74–5}}</ref><ref name=mycobank>{{cite web|title=''Amanita ceciliae''|url=http://www.mycobank.org/BioloMICS.aspx?Table=Mycobank&Rec=124200&Fields=All|publisher=MycoBank.

== Description ==
.]]
''Amanita ceciliae'' is characterized by bearing a large [[Basidiocarp|fruit body]] with a brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] {{convert|5|–|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} across. The cap has charcoal-grey patches, which are easily removable. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|7|–|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, white in colour, and there is no [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on it. It is slightly tapered to the top, and has irregular cottony bands girdling the base.

The [[universal veil]] is grey. [[Spore]]s are white, spherical in shape, non-[[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 10.2–11.7 [[micrometre]]s.

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|5|-|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} across, shape ranging from convex to flat. It is upturned, and has a deep-coloured margin. There is a low [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. It is grey to a brownish black in colour, darkest in the center and paler towards the margin. Generally smooth, the cap surface is slightly sticky when moist. The cap surface is characterized by having loose, fleecy, charcoal-grey patches of [[volva (mycology)|volva]]l remnants scattered across it. The patches are easily removed. The margin is strongly striated. The cap colour may vary, and pale forms are known to exist, for example, as in the types ''A. c. [[Form (botany)|f.]] decolora'' and ''A. c. [[Variety (botany)|var.]] pallida''. ''A. c. var. royeri'', first described by mycologist L. Maire in 2008 and occurring in France, is a cinder black-capped variation.<ref name=mycobank2>{{cite web|title='' Amanita ceciliae f. royeri''|url=http://www.mycobank.org/BioloMICS.aspx?Link=T&TableKey=14682616000000067&Rec=470004&Fields=All|work=International Mycological Association|publisher=MycoBank|access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref><ref name="Fraiture">{{cite book |author=Fraiture, A. |year=1993 |title=Les Amanitopsis d'Europe |language=fr |publisher=Jardin Botanique Nationale de Belgique |pages=41–4 |isbn=90-72619-09-9 |issn=0775-9592 |oclc=29368524}}</ref>

It is white in colour, with flat grey hairs, often in a zig-zag pattern. It does not bear a [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] and has fragile, cottony, brownish or charcoal-coloured oblique girdles of volval remnants around the stem base and lower stem.

=== Look-alikes ===

''[[Amanita sinicoflava]]'' (occurring in North America) looks quite similar, but it has a sack-like volva, unlike ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae''.<ref name=roody/> ''[[Amanita antillana|A.&nbsp;antillana]]'', of the [[Antilles]] islands, is somewhat the same, but it has ellipsoid spores unlike the spherical ones of ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae''.<ref name=antilliana>{{cite web|last=Tulloss|first=R. E.|title=''Amanita antillana''|url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20antillana|publisher=Amanitaceae.org|access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref> ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae'' is often used as a misnomer for ''[[Amanita borealisorora|A.&nbsp;borealisorora]]'', which largely occurs in North America. ''A.&nbsp;borealisorora'' is a provisional name, and the species has not yet been validly published.<ref name=borealisorora>{{cite web|last=Tulloss|first=R. E.|title=''Amanita borealisorora''|url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+borealisorora|publisher=Amanitaceae.org|access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref> The spores of ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae'' highly resemble those of ''[[Amanita cinctipes|A.&nbsp;cinctipes]]'' (mainly found in Singapore), though the former has larger spores.<ref name=cinctipes>{{cite web|last=Tulloss|first=R. E.|title=''Amanita cinctipes''|url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20cinctipes|publisher=Amanitaceae.org|access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref> The discolouration in the volva of ''[[Amanita colombiana|A.&nbsp;colombiana]]'' (from Colombia, as its name states) probably shows a relationship between the mushroom and ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae''.<ref name=colombiana>{{cite web|last=Tulloss|first=R. E.|title=''Amanita colombiana''|url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20colombiana|publisher=Amanitaceae.org|access-date=21 October 2012}}</ref> ''[[Amanita sorocula|A.&nbsp;sorocula]]'' is another lookalike. This Colombian and Mesoamerican species is often mistaken for ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae'', as both mushrooms have a volva with a weak structure and greying gills.<ref name=sorocula2>{{cite book|last=Tulloss|first=R.

L.|author3= Halling, R. E.|page=19}}</ref>  The notable difference is the strong yellow colour of the cap in immature ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae'' mushrooms. ''A.&nbsp;sorocula'' is not yet validly published, and currently is a newly accepted name.<ref name=tulloss/><ref name=sorocula>{{cite web|last=Tulloss|first=R.

Also, the volval remnants of ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae'' converge at the base to form a ring-like zone, unlike ''A.&nbsp;liquii''. Apart from this, the cellular [[pigment]]s in the sterile strip around the gills and volval remnants are much darker in colour compared to ''A.&nbsp;ceciliae''.<ref name=yang>{{cite journal|last=Yang|first=Z.

==Ecology and habitat==
;Europe
In Europe, ''Amanita ceciliae'' is widespread everywhere, though infrequently encountered.<ref name="C&D1995">{{cite book |last=Courtecuisse |first=Régis |author2=Duhem, Bernard |year=1995 |title=Mushrooms & Toadstools of Britain And Europe |publisher=Harper Collins |location=London |pages=272–3 |isbn=0-00-220025-2}}</ref> It often inhabits [[deciduous forest]]s with [[hornbeam]] (''Carpinus''), [[oak]] (''Quercus''), [[beech]] (''Fagus'') and [[birch]] (''Betula''), but it can also rarely occur with conifers: [[pine]] (''Pinus''), [[fir]] (''Abies''), [[spruce]] (''Picea'') and [[Cedrus|cedar]] (''Cedrus''). It has a preference for neutral to [[calcareous]] soils.<ref name="Fraiture" />

;North America
In North America, it is found mainly in areas east of the [[Mississippi River]], but similar mushrooms also occur in the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[Pacific Southwest|Southwest]], and [[Texas]]. Its range also stretches south into [[Mexico]].<ref name=emmanuel>{{cite journal|last=Villanueva-Jimenez|first=Emmanuel|last2=Villegas-Rios |first2=Margarita |last3=Cifuentes-Blanco |first3=Joaquin |last4=León–Avendaño |first4=Hugo|title=Diversidad del género Amanita en dos áreas con diferente condición silvícola en Ixtlán de Juárez, Oaxaca, México|journal=Revista Mexicana de Biodiversidad|year=2006|volume=77|issue=1|pages=17–22|language=es|issn=1870-3453}}</ref> They are ecologically [[mycorrhizal]], and habitats include hardwood forests and coniferous forests. The mushroom grows alone, scattered, or in groups during summer and autumn. It is primarily eastern in distribution but also reported in the Pacific Northwest, the Southwest, and Texas (with an apparent association with [[pecan]] trees).<ref name=McKnight>{{cite book|last=McKnight|first=Kent H.|title=A Field Guide to Mushrooms, North America|year=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=0-395-91090-0|author2=McKnight, Vera B.|page=226|chapter=Gilled fungi (Agarics)}}</ref>
