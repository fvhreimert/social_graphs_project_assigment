'''''Aseroe coccinea''''' is a species of [[stinkhorn]] [[fungus]] in the genus ''[[Aseroe]]''. First reported in Japan in 1989, it was not formally validated as a species until 2007, the delay related to a publication error. The receptacle, or [[basidiocarp|fruit body]], begins as a partially buried whitish egg-shaped structure, which bursts open as a hollow white [[Stipe (botany)|stipe]] with reddish arms, then erupts and grows to a height of up to {{convert|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. It matures into a star-shaped structure with seven to nine thin reddish tubular "arms" up to {{convert|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long radiating from the central area. The top of the receptacle is covered with dark olive-brown spore-slime, or [[gleba]]. ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' can be distinguished from the more common species ''[[Aseroe rubra|A.&nbsp;rubra]]'' by differences in the color of the receptacle, and in the structure of the arms. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the fungus has not been reported.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was first described provisionally (denoted by ''ad interim'') as ''Aseroe coccinea'' by the Japanese mycologists Yoshimi and [[Tsuguo Hongo]] in a 1989 publication with a Japanese description, based on a specimen collected on 29 September 1985, in [[Utsunomiya]], [[Tochigi Prefecture]], Japan.<ref name=Yoshimi1989/> The name, however, was not published validly (''nomen invalidum''), according to Article 36.1 of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]], which requires that "in order to be validly published, a name of a new taxon (algal and all fossil taxa excepted) must ... be accompanied by a Latin description or diagnosis or by a reference to a previously and effectively published Latin description or diagnosis".<ref name=McNeill1986/> Taiga Kasuya reexamined the [[type specimen]] and validated the species in a 2007 ''[[Mycoscience]]'' publication. The [[holotype]] specimen is kept at the [[National Museum of Nature and Science]] in [[Tokyo]].<ref name=Kasuya2007/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''coccinea'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''coccineus'', and means "bright red". The mushroom's Japanese name is ''Aka-hitode-take'' (アカヒトデタケ).<ref name=Kasuya2007/>

==Description==
Like all [[Phallaceae]] species, ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' begins its development in the form of a roughly spherical whitish "egg" that is {{convert|10|–|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, lying on or partially submerged in the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. On the base of the egg is a white strand of [[mycelium]]. The exo[[peridium]] (the outer tissue layer) is white to [[cream (color)|cream]]-colored with a fibrous surface. The inner layer is membranous, with a [[hyaline]] (translucent) endoperidium (inner tissue layer). The slimy spore-bearing mass, the [[gleba]], is olive-brown to greenish-black, with a slightly [[wikt:fetid|fetid]] odor. When the mushroom is mature, it covers the upper surface of a disc on the top of the receptacle. The receptacle has a cylindrical stipe, {{convert|10|–|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} tall, {{convert|7|–|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter at the top, somewhat [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] (tapered at both ends) or sometimes just tapered towards the base. The stipe is pale pink near the top, white to [[cream (color)|cream]] at the base, spongy in texture, and hollow. The top of the receptacle is flattened to form a disc that bears 7–9, narrow, tapering "arms". The arms consist of a single bright red tube-like chamber, that is {{convert|4|–|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.7|–|2|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Kasuya2007/>
[[image:Aseroe rubra Bomaderry email.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Aseroe rubra]]'' is somewhat similar in appearance, but clearly distinguished by its bifurcating (forked) arms.]]
The thick-walled [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to cylindrical, and measure 4–5 by 2–2.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent), have a smooth surface, and are sometimes truncated at the base. The peridium of the "egg" is divided into two distinct layers of tissue. The outer is up to 250–400&nbsp;μm thick, and made of filamentous, interwoven [[hypha]]e measuring 2.5–5&nbsp;μm in diameter. These hyphae are thick-walled, [[septum|septate]], and hyaline. Also present in this outer layer are thick-walled [[pseudoparenchymatous]] cells (angular, randomly arranged, and tightly packed) that are 7–50&nbsp;μm thick, spherical or nearly so, and yellowish-brown to pale brown. The inner tissue layer of the peridium is 100–250&nbsp;μm thick and made of elongated filamentous hyphae that are 2–5&nbsp;μm in diameter. These thick-walled hyphae are arranged in a roughly parallel fashion, septate, and hyaline. The receptacle consists of thick-walled, roughly spherical pseudoparenchymatous cells 5–15.5&nbsp;μm thick, that contain intracellular [[pigment]].<ref name=Kasuya2007/>

===Similar species===
''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' closely resembles ''[[Lysurus arachnoideus]]'', [[synonym (taxonomy)|syn]] ''Aseroe arachnoidea'', but may be distinguished from the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3&nbsp;μm in ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5&nbsp;μm in ''S.&nbsp;arachnoideus''). ''L.&nbsp;arachnoideus'' is known from Asia and West Africa. ''[[Aseroe rubra|A.&nbsp;rubra]]'' is a relatively common [[pantropical]] species, and differs from ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'' in its reddish receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'') and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.<ref name=Kasuya2007/><ref name=Dring1980/>

==Habitat and distribution==
Although Kasuya did not explicitly define the mode of nutrition for ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'', most [[Phallaceae]] species are suspected to be [[saprobic]]—decomposers of wood and plant [[organic matter]].<ref name=Miller1988/> The fruit bodies of ''A.&nbsp;coccinea'', known only from [[temperate]] regions of Japan ([[Tochigi Prefecture]]), grow solitarily or in groups on rice [[husk]]s, straw, or dung. They are found from summer to autumn.<ref name=Kasuya2007/>
