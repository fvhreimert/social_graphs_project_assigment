'''''Entoloma hochstetteri''''', also known as the '''blue pinkgill''', '''sky-blue mushroom''' or similar names, is a species of [[mushroom]] that is native to [[New Zealand]]. The small mushroom is a distinctive all-blue colour, while the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have a slight reddish tint from the spores. The blue colouring of the [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]] is due to [[azulene]] pigments.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Jaklitsch |first1=W.

== Naming ==
The [[Māori language|Māori]] name for the mushroom is {{lang|mi|werewere-kōkako}}, because its colour is similar to the blue [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattle]] of the [[kōkako]] bird.<ref name="Gates">{{cite web |last=Gates |first=Charlie |date=November 2013 |title=Mushroom might yield major value |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/9354061/Mushroom-might-yield-major-value |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203159/http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/9354061/Mushroom-might-yield-major-value |archive-date=24 June 2021 |accessdate=19 June 2021 |website=Stuff.co.nz |publisher=Stuff}}</ref>

==Taxonomy==

The species was first described as ''Cortinarius hochstetteri'' in 1866 by the Austrian mycologist [[Erwin Reichardt]], before being given its current binomial in 1962 by [[Greta Stevenson]]. It is named after the German-Austrian naturalist [[Ferdinand von Hochstetter]].<ref name=Horak_2008/>

In 1976 [[Egon Horak]] combined ''Entoloma hochstetteri'' and ''[[Entoloma aeruginosum]]'' from Japan with ''[[Entoloma virescens]]'' ([[:ja:ソライロタケ]]) , first described from the [[Bonin Islands]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Horak |first=E. |date=1976 |title=On cuboid-spored species of Entoloma (Agaricales) |url=https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/Sydowia_28_0171-0236.pdf |journal=Sydowia |volume=28 |issue= |pages=200–203 |access-date=19 June 2021 |archive-date=24 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203343/https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/Sydowia_28_0171-0236.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=Alves_Nascimento/> In 1989 S.

==Description==
''Entoloma hochstetteri'' has a small delicate [[epigeal|epigeous]] (above-ground) [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]] ([[basidiocarp]]). The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] may be up to 4&nbsp;cm (1.4&nbsp;in) in diameter and conical in shape. The cap colour is indigo-blue with a green tint, and is [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]]. The cap margin is striate and rolled inwards. The gill attachment is [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] or [[Emarginate gills|emarginate]], gills are thin and 3–5&nbsp;mm wide, essentially the same colour as the cap, sometimes with a yellow tint. The cylindrical [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (stalk) is up to 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) long by 0.5&nbsp;cm thick, fibrillose and stuffed. The [[spore print]] is reddish-pink. The [[spore]]s are 9.9–13.2 by 11.8–13.2 [[micrometre|μm]], tetrahedric in shape, [[hyaline]], smooth and thin-walled. The [[basidium|basidia]] are 35.2–44.2 by 8.8–13.2&nbsp;μm, club-shaped, [[hyaline]], and with two or four sterigmata.<ref name=Dhancholia>Dhancholia S. (1989).

==Mythology==


The [[Ngāi Tūhoe]] describe that the [[North Island kōkako|kōkako]] bird (''Callaeas wilsoni'') got its blue wattles from it rubbing its cheek against the mushroom, thus giving the mushroom the name ''werewere-kōkako''.<ref name=Stuff>{{cite web |last1=Manch |first1=Thomas |title=Are those magic mushrooms on the $50 note? |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/85986167/are-those-magic-mushrooms-on-the-50-note |website=Stuff |access-date=10 July 2021 |language=en |date=8 November 2016 |archive-date=10 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210710064603/https://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/85986167/are-those-magic-mushrooms-on-the-50-note |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Habitat and distribution==

''Entoloma hochstetteri'' is common in forests throughout New Zealand,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fungalguide.landcareresearch.co.nz/WebForms/FG_Genus.aspx?Group=Entoloma&pk=3353 |title=Entoloma |work=Fungal Guide |publisher=Landcare Research |access-date=19 June 2021 |archive-date=24 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624202136/https://fungalguide.landcareresearch.co.nz/WebForms/FG_Genus.aspx?Group=Entoloma&pk=3353 |url-status=live }}</ref> where it grows on soil among litter in broadleaf/[[Podocarpus|podocarp]] forest.<ref name=Horak_2008/> It fruits in January to July.<ref name=Horak_2008/>

It was also reported from India in 1989<ref name="Dhancholia" /> and from Australia, though it is unclear whether these are the same species or whether ''E. hochstetteri'' is endemic to New Zealand.<ref name=Horak_2008/>

Attempts of [[Fungiculture|lab cultivation]] of ''Entoloma hochstetteri'' have been made, to no avail.<ref name="TheSpinoff">{{Cite web |last=Sisson |first=Olivia |date=2021-10-25 |title=Could our national fungus become the blue food dye of the future? |url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/kai/25-10-2021/could-our-national-fungus-become-the-blue-food-dye-of-the-future |access-date=2023-01-21 |website=The Spinoff |language=en}}</ref>

==Toxicity==
Although many members of the genus ''[[Entoloma]]'' are poisonous, the toxicity of this species is unknown. It is being investigated to see if its [[gene cluster]] that is responsible for blue colouring might be used to manufacture a natural blue food dye.<ref name="TheSpinoff" />
