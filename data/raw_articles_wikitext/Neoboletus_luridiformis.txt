'''''Neoboletus luridiformis''''', also previously known as '''''Boletus luridiformis''''' and (invalidly) as '''''Boletus erythropus''''', is a fungus of the [[Boletaceae|bolete family]], most of which produce mushrooms with tubes and pores beneath their [[pileus (mycology)|caps]]. It is [[common name|commonly known]] as the '''scarletina bolete''', for its red pores, which are yellow when young. Other common names include the '''red foot bolete''', '''dotted stemmed bolete''', or '''dotted stem bolete'''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Scarletina Bolete – Edibility, Distribution, Identification, plus some other colourful fungi characters – Galloway Wild Foods |url=https://gallowaywildfoods.com/scarletina-bolete-edibility-distribution-identification/ |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=gallowaywildfoods.com}}</ref>

It is found in [[Northern Europe]] and North America. While [[edible mushroom|edible]] when cooked properly, it can cause vomiting and diarrhea if not. Where the two species coincide, it can be confused with species such as ''[[Rubroboletus satanas]]''.

==Taxonomy==
In 1796 [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] described ''Boletus erythropus'', deriving its [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''ερυθρος'' ("red") and ''πους'' ("foot"),<ref name=Liddell1980/> referring to its red-coloured stalk. During the next 200 years or so, this name was used extensively for the species which is the subject of this article, and which (as well as a red stalk) has red pores.<ref name=Phillips/>  Recently it was discovered however that Persoon's mushroom had orange pores, and was a different species (actually thought to be ''[[Suillellus queletii]]''),<ref name="FungaNordica"/><ref name=SF3/> so the use of this name for the red-pored mushroom was invalid.<ref name="FungaNordica"/><ref name=SF2/>

In 1844 [[Friedrich Wilhelm Gottlieb Rostkovius]] independently defined the red-pored species under the name ''Boletus luridiformis''. That is now the first valid description of the taxon and is the basis of the current name (the [[basionym]]). The significance of the epithet "luridiformis" is that it is similar to the previously known fungus ''Boletus luridus'' (now ''[[Suillellus luridus]]'').<ref name=SF1/>

Genetic analysis published in 2013 showed that ''B.&nbsp;luridiformis'' and many (but not all) red-pored boletes were part of a ''dupainii'' clade (named for ''[[Boletus dupainii]]''), well-removed from the core group of ''[[Boletus edulis]]'' and relatives within the Boletineae. This indicated that it needed to be placed in a new genus.<ref name="Nuhn 2013"/>  It became the [[type species]] of the new genus ''[[Neoboletus]]'' in 2014.<ref name="Vizzini 2014"/>

To avoid confusion, the name ''Boletus erythropus'' should now be avoided if possible (though in theory it still has a legitimate meaning as whatever species Persoon originally intended). It is not a valid synonym of ''Neoboletus luridiformis'', and that can be indicated by using the term ''[[sensu#Common nqualifiers|sensu auct.]]'' in place of the author name (that is, ''Boletus erythropus'' ''sensu auct.'' = ''Neoboletus luridiformis'' (Rostk.) Gelardi, Simonini & Vizzini).<ref name=SF1/>

==Description==
. After cutting, the yellow interior quickly turns blue due to the oxidation of various secondary metabolites]]


The large, solid fungus has a bay-brown hemispherical to convex [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] that can grow up to {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide and is initially velvety.<ref name="Arora2nd" /> It has small orange-red pores, yellow when young and rusty with age (lending it the name 'scarletina bolete');<ref>{{Cite web |title=Neoboletus luridiformis: The Ultimate Mushroom Guide |url=https://ultimate-mushroom.com/edible/554-neoboletus-luridiformis.html |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=1102 Mushroom Identifications: The Ultimate Mushroom Library |language=en}}</ref> these bruise blue to black. The tubes are yellowish-green and become blue quickly on cutting. The fat, colourful, densely red-dotted yellow [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4-15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long<ref name="Arora2nd" /> and has no network pattern (reticulation). The flesh stains dark blue when bruised; broken, or cut.<ref name=Phillips06/> There is little smell. The [[spore print]] is olive-brown.<ref name=Arora2nd/>

===Similar species===
*''[[Suillellus luridus]]'' has a network pattern on the stem, and seems to prefer chalky soil. 
*''[[Rubroboletus satanas]]''<ref name=Arora2nd/> also has a stem network, but a very-pale whitish cap, and is moderately [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].
*''[[Rubroboletus pulcherrimus]]'' has a reticulate stipe, and is larger in size.<ref name="Desjardin 2015"/>
*''[[Rubroboletus dupainii]]'' has a reddish cap.
*''[[Rubroboletus lupinus]]'' has a smooth stem.
*''[[Imperator rhodopurpureus]]'' prefers neutral soil.

==Distribution and habitat==
The fungus is common in Europe, growing in [[deciduous]] or [[conifer]]ouswoodland in summer and autumn.<ref name=Phillips06/>  It is often found in the same places as ''[[Boletus edulis]]''. It is also widely distributed in [[North America]], and is especially common under [[spruce]] in its range from Northern [[California]] to [[Alaska]]. In Eastern North America it grows with both soft, and hardwood trees.<ref name=Arora2nd/> It seems to prefer [[acidic soil]].

==Edibility==
The mild-flavored species is said to be [[edible mushroom|edible]] after being well cooked, although some people are adversely affected by it. Mycologist [[David Arora]] reported that one man being poisoned after eating a [[sautéed]] specimen.<ref name=Arora2nd/> Some literature recommends cooking it for 20 minutes.{{citation needed|date=June 2025}} When raw or insufficiently cooked it can cause [[gastroenteritis]], for this same reason it is not recommended for drying. Caution is advised as it resembles other potentially hazardous blue-staining boletes and should thus be avoided by novice mushroom hunters.<ref name=Phillips/><ref name="Arora2nd"/> It is commonly collected in several European countries.
