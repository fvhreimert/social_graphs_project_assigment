'''''Phellodon melaleucus''''', commonly known as the '''grey tooth''',<ref name="BMS"/> is a species of [[tooth fungus]] in the family [[Bankeraceae]]. It was originally [[species description|described]] by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1815 as a species of ''[[Hydnum]]''.<ref name="Fries 1815"/> In 1881, [[Petter Karsten]] included it as one of the original three species in his newly [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] genus ''[[Phellodon]]''.<ref name="Karsten 1881"/> The fungus is widely distributed in Europe and North America, where it associates [[mycorrhizal]]ly with a wide range of [[host (biology)|host]] trees. It is considered [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] in Switzerland.<ref name="Senn-Irlet 2007"/>

==Description==
The grey tooth is a small to medium-sized fungus with a leathery or corky fruiting body. On the underside it has pale grayish-brown spines from which spores are released rather  than from [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]]. It may look like a convoluted single fruiting body but in fact each part has a blackish stem, and several caps can fuse together. The cap tends to be concentrically zoned with a reddish-brown to blackish-brown centre and a pale edge. The flesh is greyish-brown, darker near the base of the stem, and smells of [[fenugreek]].<ref name=NIPriority>{{cite web |url=http://www.habitas.org.uk/priority/species.asp?item=21218 |title=''Phellodon melaleucus'' – grey tooth |author=Allen & Mellon Environmental Ltd.|work=Northern Ireland Priority Species |access-date=7 March 2020}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
This species occurs in various parts of Europe and has been recorded in North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/phellodon-melaleucus.php |title=''Phellodon melaleucus'' (Sw. ex Fr.) P. Karst. - Grey Tooth |publisher=First Nature |access-date=7 March 2020}}</ref> It is uncommon in the United Kingdom and very rare in Ireland. This is an ectomycorrhizal species that forms a [[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with the [[root]]s of various [[plant]]s, usually trees; the [[hypha]]e of the fungus wrap round the rootlets of the host tree, and there is an exchange of nutrients between the two.<ref>{{cite book |title="Mycorrhizae." Encyclopedia of Microbiology |last=Dighton |first=J. |year=2009 |pages=153–162 }}</ref> It is typically found growing on the ground on mossy banks in the vicinity of its hosts. In the British Isles it is associated with various trees including [[oak]], [[beech]], [[sweet chestnut]], [[birch]], [[Scots pine]] and [[spruce]].<ref name=NIPriority/>
