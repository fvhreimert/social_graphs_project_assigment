The [[edible mushroom|edible]] wild mushroom '''''Russula heterophylla''''', that has lately been given the [[common name]] of the '''greasy green brittlegill'''<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 978-0-330-44237-4}}</ref> is placed in the genus ''[[Russula]]'', the members of which are mostly known as '''brittlegills'''.  It is a variably colored mushroom, found in [[deciduous]] forests, and woods in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]], and [[Scandinavia]].<ref name=C&D1995>{{cite book | author = Regis Courtecuisse and Bernard Duhem  | year = 1995 | title = Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and Europe | publisher = Harper Collins | isbn = 978-0-00-220025-7}}</ref> Appearing with broad-leaved trees in summer to early autumn, it usually has a greenish coloration.

==Taxonomy==
Noted and described by the [[South Africa]]n-born [[mycologist]] [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] as ''Agaricus lividus'' in 1801. It was placed in the ''[[Russula]]'' [[Genus]] by the Swedish mycologist, and botanist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838, with the epithet ''heterophylla''. Despite many changes, by several mycologists over the years since then, it is this binomial that is currently recognised,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=193557 |title=Species Fungorum Current Name: Russula heterophylla (Fr.) |access-date=2009-04-20 |archive-date=2007-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108141024/http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=193557 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and is in use at present.

The variants ''Russula heterophylla'' var. ''chlora'' Gillet 1876, and ''Russula heterophylla'' var. ''virginea'' (Cooke and Massee) A.Pearson & Dennis, have been given species status as ''[[Russula violeipes]]'', and ''[[Russula virginea]]'' respectively.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in}} in diameter. It is known to vary in colour, and can be various shades of green, brown, or ochre. It is initially round, flattening with age, and laters develops a depression. The white [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is firm, browning, and gives a salmon reaction when rubbed with [[ferrous sulfate]]. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed, and white giving a [[spore print]] of the same colour.<ref name=Phillips06/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
The [[basidiospore|spores]] are the smallest in the genus, and are 5–7 by 4–6&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]],  spherical to elliptical, or pear shaped; warts 0.2–0.6&nbsp;μm high, mostly isolated, but occasionally two or three joined together, or connected by a line.<ref name=Phillips06/>

===Similar species===
Green forms of ''Russula cyanoxantha'' can be distinguished, because they give a greenish reaction, or no reaction when rubbed with iron salts such as ferrous sulfate, and have the flexible, 'greasy' feeling gills characteristic of that species.

''[[Russula virescens]]'' (Schaeff.) Fr.,  has a cracked or fragmented cap surface.

''[[Russula aeruginea]]'' Fr.,  grows with [[Birch]].

''[[Russula langei]]'' Bon, also has a green reaction to ferrous sulphate, and smells like shellfish, with flesh that stains orange-brown.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Russula heterophylla'' appears in summer to early autumn, usually growing in small groups. It is occasional in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]], and [[Scandinavia]].<ref name=C&D1995/> It grows with several species of [[deciduous|broad-leaved]] trees, on the roots of which it is [[ectomycorrhizal]].

==Edibility==
This mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |orig-year=2005 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=141}}</ref> and good, although care must be taken as it is very like the deadly ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' (death cap) when young. It is also prone to slug attacks.
