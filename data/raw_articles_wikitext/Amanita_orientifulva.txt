'''''Amanita orientifulva''''', also known as the '''Asian orange-brown ringless amanita''', is a species of [[agaric]] fungus that fruits singly or scattered from June to September.<ref name="Yang 2004"/>

This medium to large agaric has a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with a diameter measuring {{convert|5|–|14|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} and a [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] length of up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=2}} and a thickness of {{convert|0.5|–|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}}. [[Lamella (mycology)|Gills]] on the cap underside are free from attachment to the stipe, crowded closely together, and white to cream in colour with brownish edges. The fruit body has a sac-like [[volva (mycology)|volva]] and lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the stipe. The overall colour of the fruit body is brownish with a yellowish to orange cap centre. Its [[basidiospore|spores]] are spherical or nearly so, measuring 10–14 by 9.5–13&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. Names for its similarity to the widespread ''[[Amanita fulva|A. fulva]]'' (a species with which it was previously confused), it can be distinguished by microscopic features of the volva.<ref name="Yang 2004"/>

It is found at altitudes ranging from {{convert|1300|–|4200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in south-western China. It is associated with trees, especially ''[[Abies]]'', ''[[Quercus]]'', ''[[Salix]]'', and occasionally ''[[Castanopsis]]''.<ref name="Yang 2004" />
