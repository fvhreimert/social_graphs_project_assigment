'''''Psilocybe baeocystis''''' is a [[psilocybin mushroom]] of the family [[Hymenogastraceae]]. It contains the [[hallucinogenic]] compounds [[psilocybin]], [[psilocin]] and [[baeocystin]].
The species is [[common name|commonly]] known by various names such as bottle caps, knobby tops, blue bells, olive caps, blue Meanies.

==Etymology and history==
*From the Greek words ''baeo'' (little) and ''kystis'' (bladder)
*1945 ''P. baeocystis'' is first collected in [[Eugene, Oregon]].<ref name="Singer&Smith1958"/>
*1958 ''P. baeocystis'' is formally described and published by Singer and Smith.<ref name="Singer&Smith1958"/>
*1962 [[Psilocin]] is first reported in this species.<ref name="pmid13867140"/>
*1967-68 [[Baeocystin]]<ref name="pmid6067681"/> and [[norbaeocystin]]<ref name="pmid5684732"/> are discovered and named.
*1981 Testing again reveals [[psilocybin]], [[psilocin]], [[baeocystin]] and [[norbaeocystin]].<ref name="pmid7194879"/>

==Description==
*Pileas: The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|15|-|55|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and [[conic]] to obtusely conic to [[wikt:convex|convex]]. The cap margin is turned inwards when young, rarely becoming plane in age, often distinctly rippled, translucent-striate and bruising and aging greenish-bluish about the margin. It is dark olive brown to buff brown in color, occasionally steel blue; when dried it tends toward copper brown in the center. It is [[hygrophanous]], fading to milk white, and viscid when moist from a gelatinous [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]], usually separable. The flesh is thin and bruises blue easily
*Gills: The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are close with [[Lamella (mycology)|adnate]] to [[Lamella (mycology)|sinuate]] attachment and are grayish to cinnamon brown, with the edges remaining pallid.
*Spore Print: dark purplish brown
*Stipe: The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|5|-|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|2|-|3|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and equal to [[wikt:subequal|subequal]]. The color is pallid to brownish with white filaments, while often more yellowish towards the apex. Distinct [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]]s are found at the base. The stipe is brittle, stuffed with loose fibers, and the [[partial veil]] is [[wikt:evanescent|evanescent]] and rapidly becomes indistinguishable.
*Taste: [[farinaceous]]
*Odor: farinaceous
*Stain: It stains blue easily where damaged. 

===Microscopic features===

''Psilocybe baeocystis'' [[spore]]s are dark purplish brown in deposit, oblong in face view or asymmetric ellipsoid (mango form) in side view,  and are (8.5) 9.5–13.7(17) x (5) 5.5–6.6(7.1) [[μm]].<ref name="Guzman1978"/>
The [[basidia]] are 4-spored, and [[pleurocystidia]] are absent. The [[cheilocystidia]] are 20–30(40) x 4.5–6(9) [[μm]] and [[wikt:fusoid|fusiod]] with a narrow neck.<ref name="isbn0-89815-839-7"/>

This species closely resembles [[subtropical]] ''[[Psilocybe aztecorum]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe quebecensis]]'', which also have caps that bleach in color to white when dry.<ref name="Guzman1978" />



==Habitat and distribution==
''Psilocybe baeocystis'' is solitary to [[wikt:cespitose|cespitose]], and scattered to numerous on ground bark, wood chips, [[peat moss]], decaying conifer mulch, occasionally on lawns, pastures, and rarely in [[coniferous forest]]s. Often found growing under plants like [[rhododendrons]] and rose bushes in mulched garden beds, sometimes growing amongst other ''Psilocybe'' species such as ''[[Psilocybe stuntzii]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe cyanescens]]''. ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' grows from August through December, and rarely as early as the end of June. ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' is a [[hemiboreal]] mushroom, common throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]].

==Biochemistry==
[[Psilocin]] was first reported in this species in Benedict et al., 1962,<ref name="pmid13867140"/> and a few years later, Leung and Paul would report the related compound [[baeocystin]], isolated from saprophytic culture,<ref name="pmid6067681"/> as well as the [[desmethyl]] metabolite [[norbaeocystin]].<ref name="pmid5684732"/> Beug and Bigwood (1981) also reported on the concentrations of these compounds in ''Psilocybe baeocystis'' using [[High performance liquid chromatography#Reverse Phase chromatography|reverse-phase HPLC]] and [[thin-layer chromatography]].<ref name="pmid7194879"/> Concentration ranges for psychoactive compounds from these studies were reported to be 0.15–0.85% psilocybin, up to 0.59% psilocin, and up to 0.10% baeocystin.

==Classification==
This mushroom has been placed in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Aztecorum'' by [[Gaston Guzman]]; other members of the section include ''[[Psilocybe aztecorum var. aztecorum]]'', ''[[Psilocybe aztecorum var. bonetii]]'', ''[[Psilocybe pseudoaztecorum]]'', and ''[[Psilocybe quebecensis]]''.
