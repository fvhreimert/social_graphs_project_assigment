'''''Boletus barrowsii''''', also known in English as the '''white king bolete''' after its pale colored [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], is a species of fungus in the genus ''[[Boletus]]''. It was formerly considered a color variant of ''[[Boletus edulis|B.&nbsp;edulis]]''.

It can be found under [[ponderosa pine]] and [[live oak]] in western North America during autumn. It is [[edible mushrooms|edible]] and highly regarded.

== Taxonomy ==
The species was officially described by American mycologists [[Harry D. Thiers]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]] in 1976 from a specimen collected near [[Jacob Lake, Arizona]], on August 21, 1971, by amateur mycologist Charles "Chuck" Barrows, who had studied the mushroom in New Mexico. It was previously held to be a white colour form of [[Boletus edulis|''B.&nbsp;edulis'']].<ref name="thiers_smith76">{{cite journal |vauthors=Thiers HD, Smith AH |year=1976 |title=Boletes of the Southwestern United States |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=261–73}}</ref> A&nbsp;2010 molecular study found that ''B.&nbsp;barrowsii'' was sister to a lineage that gave rise to the species [[Boletus quercophilus|''B.&nbsp;quercophilus'']] of Costa Rica and [[Boletus nobilissimus|''B.&nbsp;nobilissimus'']] of eastern North America.<ref name="dent10">{{cite journal |vauthors=Dentinger BT, Ammirati JF, Both EE, Desjardin DE, Halling RE, Henkel TW, Moreau PA, Nagasawa E, Soytong K, Taylor AF, Watling R, Moncalvo JM, McLaughlin DJ |year=2010 |title=Molecular phylogenetics of porcini mushrooms (''Boletus'' section ''Boletus'') |url=http://static.msi.umn.edu/rreports/2010/211.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=1276–92 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2010.10.004 |pmid=20970511 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523094609/http://static.msi.umn.edu/rreports/2010/211.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-23}}</ref>

== Description ==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|5–25|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} in diameter, initially convex in shape before flattening, with a smooth or slightly tomentose surface, and gray-white, white or [[buff (color)|buff]] color.<ref name="arora86" /> The thick [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white and does not stain blue when bruised.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=325}}</ref> The pores are initially whitish, later yellow. The stout [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white with a brown reticulated pattern, and may be {{convert|6–20|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} high with an apical diameter of 2–6&nbsp;cm (1–2&nbsp;in). The [[basidiospore|spores]] are elliptical to spindle-shaped and 13–15 x 4–5&nbsp;[[μm]] in dimensions; they produce an olive-brown [[spore print]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=Noah|last2=Schwarz|first2=Christian|title=Mushrooms of the Redwood Coast|isbn=9781607748175|publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]]|year=2016|location=Berkeley, CA|page=425}}</ref>

Like ''B.&nbsp;edulis'', it is often found eaten by [[maggot]]s.<ref name="arora86">{{cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0/page/529 |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley |page=529 |orig-date=1979 |url-access=registration}}</ref> It has a strong odor while drying.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=214}}</ref>

=== Similar species ===
In addition to ''B. edulis'',<ref name="thiers_smith76" /> the species could also be confused with the similarly pale-capped [[Rubroboletus satanas|''B.&nbsp;satanas'']], though the flesh of the latter stains blue when cut or bruised, and it has a reddish stem and pores. The latter species is [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] when raw.

''[[Caloboletus marshii]]'' is also similar.<ref name="audu" />

== Habitat and distribution ==
The white king bolete is [[ectomycorrhiza]]l, found under ''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'' (ponderosa pine) inland, and ''[[Quercus agrifolia]]'' (coast live oak) closer to the west coast. Fruit bodies appear after rain, and will be more abundant if this occurs in early autumn rather than later in the year through to winter. It is abundant in the warmer parts of its range, namely [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], but also occurs in [[Colorado]], west into [[California]]<ref name="arora86" /> and north to [[British Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://linnet.geog.ubc.ca/Atlas/Atlas.aspx?sciname=Boletus%20barrowsii&noTransfer=0 | title = eflora atlas of BC | year = 2020}}</ref> It has been recorded from the San Marcos Foothills in [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]].<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Holmgren M, Stone T, Kelly M | url = http://www.sanmarcosfoothills.org/Plan4/PDF/SMFC_Plan.pdf | title = A Plan for the Preservation and Stewardship of San Marcos Foothills Coalition, Santa Barbara, California | year = 2001 | pages = 1–94 | location = Santa Barbara | publisher = San Marcos Foothills Coalition | accessdate = 2008-03-12 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080513214513/http://sanmarcosfoothills.org/Plan4/PDF/SMFC_Plan.pdf | archivedate = 2008-05-13 }}</ref>

==Uses==
The species is [[edible mushroom|edible]] and highly regarded in New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado. It was eaten for many years while assumed to be a form of ''B.&nbsp;edulis''.<ref name="arora86"/>
