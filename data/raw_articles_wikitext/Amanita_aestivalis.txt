'''''Amanita aestivalis''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''white American star-footed amanita''',<ref name=NGSWG/> is a species of [[fungus]] in the [[mushroom]] family [[Amanitaceae]]. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the white [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] is {{convert|5|to|8.5|cm|abbr=off|frac=4}} in diameter. It sits atop a [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] that is {{convert|8.5|to|16|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long. The entire fruit body will slowly stain a reddish-brown color in response to bruising. ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' may be a synonym for ''[[Amanita brunnescens|A.&nbsp;brunnescens]]'', and may be confused with several other white-bodied amanitas. The fungus is distributed in eastern North America.

== Description ==
 is found on the upper part of the stem.]]
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] is {{convert|5|to|8.5|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} in diameter, and depending on its age, may range from egg-shaped to convex to somewhat flattened. Older specimens may have edges that are curved upwards. The color is white or pale tan in the center of the cap; older specimens may have areas of discolored tissue colored brownish-red shades. Sometimes, the edge of the cap has radial grooves—up to {{convert|4|mm|abbr=|frac=8}} long—that mirror the position of the underlying [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]].<ref name="Singer1959" /> When moist, the cap is sticky to the touch; when dry, it is shiny, usually without any remnants of the thin volva. The white gills are crowded close together, and are free from attachment to the stem. They are ''subventricose'': slightly swollen in the middle, and tapering near the ends.<ref name="Jenkins1986" />

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|8.5|to|16|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} long by {{convert|0.9|to|1.6|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick, and slightly thicker at the base than at the top. It is stuffed with whitish [[hypha]]e that resemble cotton. The surface of the stem is smooth or has delicate tufts of soft, white, woolly hairs. There is a rimmed bulb at the base of the stem, which can reach a diameter of over {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=8|1}}.<ref name="Singer1959" /> The [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]—located on the upper portion of the stem, {{convert|1.2|-|1.7|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} from the top<ref name="Singer1959" />—is white, membranous, and long-lasting. The [[volva (mycology)|volva]] remains closely attached to the bulb, although a portion may stretch out like a thin membrane and adhere to the base of the stem before collapsing. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] will slowly turn pinkish-brown to chocolate-brown when it has been injured or bruised.<ref name="Jenkins1986" /> Young specimens do not have any distinct odor, but fruit bodies may smell slightly of onions or garlic in age.<ref name="Singer1959" />

=== Microscopic characteristics ===
Viewed in deposit, like with a [[spore print]], the [[basidiospores]] of ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' are white. Examination with a microscope reveals further details: they are roughly spherical, [[hyaline]] (translucent) and thin-walled, with dimensions of 7.8–8.8&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The spores are [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning that they will absorb [[iodine]] when stained with [[Melzer's reagent]] and appear blue to blackish-blue. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 32–60 long by 4–13&nbsp;μm thick.<ref name="Jenkins1986" /> There are no clamps present at the bases of the basidia.<ref name="A. aestivalis@Amanita Studies" />

=== Similar species ===

According to Singer, the species is often mistaken for ''[[Amanita verna|A.&nbsp;verna]]'' in the eastern United States. ''A.&nbsp;verna'', however, has ellipsoid spores. Other white amanitas within the range of ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' include the deadly toxic species ''[[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]]'' (has a more loose cottony stem), ''[[Amanita phalloides|A.&nbsp;phalloides]]'' (the cap usually has an olive-green tint) and ''[[Amanita bisporigera|A.&nbsp;bisporigera]]'' (typically has two-spored basidia). ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' is sometimes considered a white form of ''[[Amanita brunnescens|A.&nbsp;brunnescens]]'', but this latter species has dusky brownish gray radial stripes and usually has many fibrils (short section of [[hypha]]e) projecting from the surface, to produce a fine, hairy appearance. Further, it stains more rapidly than ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis''.<ref name="Singer1959" /> ''[[Amanita asteropus|A.&nbsp;asteropus]]'' (the "European star-footed Amanita") is cream to yellow color, and differs from ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' in its reaction to [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical tests]]. It is only known from Europe.<ref name="A. asteropus@Amanita Studies" />

== Taxonomy ==
American mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] first described the species in 1949 based on specimens he had collected in [[Massachusetts]], [[Michigan]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Virginia]].<ref name="Singer1949" /> Because this original report was published without a [[Latin]] description (contrary to the naming conventions of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]), he later amended his description in 1959.<ref name="Singer1959" /> There is some doubt as to whether ''A.&nbsp;aestivalis'' is a distinct species from ''A.&nbsp;brunnescens'' (the "brown American star-footed Amanita"), as described by [[George F. Atkinson]] in 1918.<ref name="A. brunnescens@Amanita Studies" /> Singer claimed that the latter species could be distinguished from the former by the consistent absence of dusky brownish-gray radial stripes on the cap. However, in 1927, mycologist [[Louis Charles Christopher Krieger]] described the variant ''A.&nbsp;brunnescens'' var. ''pallida'', which he said was identical to ''A.&nbsp;brunnescens'' except for the white or very pale cap.<ref name="A. brunnescens@Amanita Studies" /> In his 1986 [[monograph]] on North American species of ''Amanita'', David T. Jenkins preferred to reserve judgment on the matter.<ref name="Jenkins1986" />

''Amanita aestivalis'' is [[biological classification|classified]] in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Vallidae'' of the genus ''Amanita'', a grouping of amanitas characterized by having spherical spores, well-developed [[annulus (mycology)|rings]], weakly reddening flesh, and "limbate" volvals (with narrow "limbs" protruding from a soft, margined bulb).<ref name="Singer1986" />

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] adjective ''aestivalis'', meaning "pertaining to the summer".<ref name="Stearn2004" /><ref name="Eggli Newton 2004" /> Its [[common name|vernacular name]] is the "white American star-footed Amanita".<ref name="A. aestivalis@Amanita Studies" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
Fruit bodies typically appear from late June until autumn. In North America, it has been found in the states of [[New England]], as well as [[Alabama]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]].<ref name="Singer1959" /><ref name="Jenkins1986" /> The distribution extends north to the southeastern provinces of Canada<ref name="A. aestivalis@Amanita Studies" /> and south to [[Florida]].<ref name="Singer1959" />

Fruit bodies of the fungus grow on the ground in [[temperate deciduous forest|deciduous]], [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]], and [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]]. A preference has been noted for oak woods containing ''[[Tsuga]]'' or ''[[Pinus]]'' species, as well as beech wood with ''[[Picea]]'', ''[[Abies]]'', and ''[[Betula]]''.

== Ecology ==
''A. aestivalis'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species,<ref name="Hu1980" /> meaning it forms a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship in which the [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative]] [[hypha]]e of the fungus grow around and enclose the tiny roots of trees and shrubs. In this way, the plant is better able to absorb [[phosphorus]] and other soil nutrients, while the fungus receives moisture, protection, and nutritive byproducts of the plant's metabolism.<ref name="Alexopolous1996" />

== Edibility ==
Although the [[edible mushroom|edibility]] has not been documented for this species, some sources have noted that toxicity is suspected.<ref name="Jenkins1986" /><ref name="Gibbons1990" />
