'''''Inocybe corydalina var. corydalina''''', commonly known as the '''greenflush fibrecap''', is a member of the [[Inocybe|genus ''Inocybe'']] which is widely distributed in temperate forests.  It is a small [[mycorrhizal]] mushroom which contains a small amount of the hallucinogen [[psilocybin]].

==Description==
*'''Cap''':  3.5–5&nbsp;cm diameter, buff to brown, often with greenish tones, [[conic]] to [[wiktionary:convex|convex]] or plane in age, with or without an umbo, with appressed [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] [[wikt:squamules|squamules]] on the cap which are more frequent towards the center, and an incurved margin.  The center of the cap is darker brown to greenish, sometimes black and the flesh is white.
*'''Gills''': [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] and very numerous, pale cream brown to grayish buff.
*'''Spores''': Smooth and lemon shaped, measuring 8 x 5.5 micrometres, dull brown, often with a bluish-grayish stem base.
*'''Stipe''': 2.5–10&nbsp;cm long, 4 to 6&nbsp;mm thick, and is equal width for the whole length, sometimes with some swelling at the base.  The upper part of the stem is smooth and the lower part is fibrillose.  Has a cortinate partial veil which soon disappears.
*'''Taste''':
*'''Odor''': Aromatic.
*'''Microscopic features''': Pleurocystidia 33-70 by 9-21 micrometers, clavate cylindrical.  Cheilocystidia are not common and look like pleurocystidia.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Inocybe corydalina var. corydalina'' is widespread across Europe and the British Isles.  It usually fruits in the fall under deciduous trees but can also be found under conifers.

==Edibility==
Gurevich and Nezoiminogo reported that this mushroom contains the mycotoxin [[muscarine]] but no psilocybin; other researchers have been unable to confirm this result. Chemical analysis by Stijve and Kuyper shows that it contains 0.032% psilocybin, a very low concentration.
