'''''Amanita jacksonii''''', also known as '''Jackson's slender amanita''',<ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> '''American Slender Caesar''', and '''Eastern Caesar's Amanita''',<ref>https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/amanita-jacksonii/ accessed Aug. 2021</ref> is a North American species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Amanitaceae]]. It is a reddish-orange colored mushroom species which can be identified by its yellow gills, large, white, sacklike [[volva (mycology)|volva]].<ref>Kuo, M. (2008, March). Amanita jacksonii. Retrieved from the MushroomExpert.Com Web site: http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_jacksonii.html</ref>

==Taxonomy==
It was given its current name in 1984 by Canadian mycologist [[René Pomerleau]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pomerleau R. |year=1984 |title=A propos du nom scientifique de l'oronge américaine |journal=Naturaliste Canadien |language=fr |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=329–30}}</ref>

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the mushroom is {{Convert|8–12|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} wide; oval at first, becoming convex, typically with a central bump; sticky; brilliant red or orange, fading to yellow on the margin; typically without warts or patches; the margin lined for about 40–50% of the cap's radius. The red pigment fades from margin toward the center with age.<ref>http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/jacksoni.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104341/http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/jacksoni.html |date=2011-07-16 }}  By R. E. Tulloss.</ref> Gills are moderately crowded to crowded, orange-yellow to yellow-orange to yellow. They are free from the stem or slightly attached to it; yellow to orange-yellow; crowded; not bruising. The short gills are subtruncate to truncate. Its [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] measures {{Convert|90–140 × 9–16|mm|abbr=out|frac=4}}, is yellow and decorated with orange fibrils and patches that are the remnants of a felted extension of the limbus internus of the otherwise white volva. The [[Basidiospore|spores]] measure (7.0-) 7.8–9.8 (-12.1) × (5.2-) 5.8–7.5 (-8.7) μm and are broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid (rarely subglobose or elongate) and inamyloid.  Clamps are common at bases of [[basidia]].<ref>http://www.amanitaceae.org/index.php?Amanita%20jacksonii Amanita jacksonii-www.amanitaceae.org</ref> The flesh looks whitish to pale yellow, and does not stain on exposure.

=== Similar species ===
''A. jacksonii'' looks similar to ''[[Amanita caesarea|A. caesarea]]'' (Caesar's mushroom), which is found in Europe and North Africa, as well as [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species of ''[[Amanita]]''.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Its range extends from the [[Province of Quebec]], [[Canada]], to at least the State of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], [[Mexico]].<ref>Mushroom Observer-Amanita jacksonii Pomerleau https://mushroomobserver.org/name/show_name?_js=on&_new=true&id=1067</ref> It has been observed as far south as [[Cayo District]], [[Belize]].

== Uses ==
The mushroom is considered a choice [[Edible mushroom|edible]], although it can be misidentified with toxic species such as ''[[Amanita muscaria|A. muscaria]]'' and ''[[A. phalloides]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.
