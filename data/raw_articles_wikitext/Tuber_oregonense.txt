'''''Tuber oregonense''''', commonly known as the '''Oregon white truffle''', is a species of [[truffle]] in the genus ''[[Tuber (fungus)|Tuber]]''. The species was described as new to science in 2010.

The [[ascocarp|fruit bodies]] are roughly spherical to irregular in shape, and resemble small potatoes up to {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on|0}} in diameter. Inside the truffle is the [[gleba]], which is initially white before it becomes a marbled [[tan (color)|tan]] color. The large, often thick-walled, and strongly ornamented [[spore]]s are produced in large spherical [[ascus|asci]].

The species is found on the western coast of North America, from [[northern California]] to southern [[British Columbia]] west of the [[Cascade Range]]. A [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, it grows in a [[mutualism (biology)|symbiotic association]] with [[Douglas-fir]]. It overlaps in distribution with the closely related ''[[Tuber gibbosum|T.&nbsp;gibbosum]]'', but they have different growing seasons: ''T.&nbsp;oregonense'' typically appears from October through March, while ''T.&nbsp;gibbosum'' grows from January to June.

The truffle is highly prized for its taste and aroma. Some individuals have claimed success in cultivating the truffles in [[Christmas tree farm]]s. It is an edible truffle.

The species was first [[species description|officially described]] and named in a 2010 ''[[Mycologia]]'' article,<ref name=Bonito2010/> although ''T. oregonense'' had been previously used provisionally (as ''Tuber oregonense'' <small>Trappe & Bonito</small>)<ref name="Trappe106-207"/> in American [[field guide]]s and other popular publications for several years.<ref name=Miller2006/><ref name=Trudell2009/><ref>Hall ''et al''.

The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''oregonense'' derives from the name [[Oregon]] and the [[Latin]] suffix -''ense'' (relating to), in reference to western Oregon being its central region of abundance.<ref>Trappe ''et al.'' (2007), p. 123.</ref> The fungus is [[common name|commonly]] known as the Oregon white truffle. Truffle authority James Trappe initially intended to name the species as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Tuber gibbosum|T.&nbsp;gibbosum]]'' (i.e., as ''T.&nbsp;gibbosum'' var. ''oregonense'')<ref name=Lefevre2001/> before [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis revealed that genetic differences warranted distinction at the species level.<ref name=Bonito2010/>

''Tuber oregonense'' is part of the ''gibbosum'' [[clade]] of the genus ''[[Tuber (fungus)|Tuber]]'', which contains species that have "peculiar wall thickenings on hyphal tips emerging from the peridial surface at maturity."<ref name=Bonito2010/>

The [[ascomata|fruit bodies]] of ''T.&nbsp;oregonense'' are hypogeous (growing in the ground), typically {{convert|0.5–5|cm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} broad, although specimens up to {{convert|7.5|cm|abbr=on|round=0.5}} have been recorded. Smaller specimens are spherical or nearly so, and have random furrows; larger specimens are more irregular in shape, lobed and deeply furrowed. Young fruit bodies have a white [[peridium]], as the truffle matures it develops red to reddish-brown or orangish-brown patches; with age it becomes orange-brown to reddish-brown overall and often develops cracks on the surface. The peridium is 0.2–0.4&nbsp;mm thick, and the surface texture ranges from relatively smooth to covered with tiny "hairs" that are more dense in the furrows, and more scattered on the exposed lobes. The [[gleba]] is solid; in youth the fertile tissue is whitish and marbled with mostly narrow, white, [[hypha]]-stuffed veins that emerge throughout the peridium to its surface. In maturity, the fertile tissue is light brown to brown from the color of the spores, but the marbling veins remain white. The odor and flavor of the flesh are mild in youth, but soon become strong, pungent and complex, or "truffly".<ref name=Bonito2010/>

[[image:Tuber oregonense 35390.jpg|thumb|A two-spored ascus; the ellipsoid spores have a honeycomb-like surface network ornamented with numerous spikes.]]

The [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to somewhat spindle-shaped with narrowed ends, and light brownish in color. The size of the spores varies depending upon the type of asci in which they develop: in one-spored [[ascus|asci]] they measure 42.5–62.5 by 17.5–30&nbsp;[[μm]]; in two-spored asci they are 32.5–50 by 15–25&nbsp;μm; in three-spored asci they are 27.5–45 by 15–25&nbsp;μm; in four-spored asci they are 25–38.5 by 13–28&nbsp;μm; in five-spored asci 28–34 by 22–25&nbsp;μm (all sizes excluding surface ornamentation). The spore walls are 2–3&nbsp;μm thick and are covered with a honeycomb-like ([[wikt:alveolate|alveolate]]) network. The cavities of the honeycomb typically have five or six sides, and the corners form spines that are 5–7&nbsp;μm tall by 0.5&nbsp;μm thick. A "microreticulum" appears in some spores when the [[light microscope]] [[objective (optics)|objective]] is focused on the optical cross section but not on the spore wall surface, or on [[scanning electron microscopy]] micrographs of the surface. Young asci range in shape from spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ovoid (egg-shaped) or pyriform (pear-shaped); sometimes the base of the ascus is narrowed like a [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and measures up to 15 by 7&nbsp;μm. Mature asci are spherical to broadly ellipsoid or misshapen from the pressure of crowded spores within. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent), thin-walled, 60–85 by 65–75&nbsp;μm, 1–4-(occasionally 5)-spored, and astipitate (without a stipe) at maturity.<ref name=Bonito2010/>

The peridiopellis (the cuticle of the peridium) is 200–300&nbsp;μm thick plus or minus 80&nbsp;μm of tightly interwoven hyphae that are 3–5 (sometimes up to 10)&nbsp;μm broad. The cells are short and have nearly hyaline walls that measure 0.5–1&nbsp;μm thick; the interior veins emerge through the peridium the cells and often form a localized tissue of rounded cells up to 12&nbsp;μm broad. The degree to which the surface is covered with fine "hairs" is variable; these hairs are made of tangled hyphae and emergent thin-walled hyphal tips 2–5&nbsp;μm in diameter, some even and smooth, some with [[granule (cell biology)|granulated]] surfaces and some with moniliform walls (resembling a string of beads) that are irregularly thickened by hyaline bands that are 0.5–2&nbsp;μm wide. The subpellis (the tissue layer immediately under the pellis) is abruptly differentiated from the pellis, 150–220&nbsp;μm thick, and comprises interwoven, nearly hyaline, thin-walled hyphae 2–10&nbsp;μm wide with scattered cells up to 15&nbsp;μm wide. The gleba is made of hyaline, thin-walled, interwoven hyphae that are 2–7&nbsp;μm broad with scattered cells that are inflated up to 15&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Bonito2010/>

===Similar species===

''Tuber oregonense'' closely resembles ''T. gibbosum'', which grows in the same habitats, but may be distinguished by the structure of its peridium, and differences in spores size and shape. Further, ''T.&nbsp;gibbosum'' grows from January to June.<ref>Trappe ''et al.'', (1997). pp. 102–103.</ref> Another similar species in ''Elaphomyces granulatus''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

Like all ''Tuber'' species, ''T.&nbsp;oregonense'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l. The fungus grows west of the [[Cascade Mountains]] from the southern [[Puget Sound]] region of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], south to southwestern Oregon at elevations from near sea level up to {{convert|425|m|abbr=on|-1}} in pure stands of ''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'' forests up to 100 years old, or ''[[Pseudotsuga]]'' mixed with ''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'', ''[[Picea sitchensis]]'', or ''[[Alnus]]'' species.  The species has been commercially harvested in the Pacific Northwest since the 1980s.<ref name=Lefevre2001/> and is often found in Christmas tree plantations as young as five years. The Oregon Truffle Festival, held in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]] yearly since 2006 to coincide with the maturing of the truffle in late January, features activities such as cultivation seminars and truffle hunting excursions.<ref name="urlOTF"/> Fruit bodies are produced from September through the middle of March.<ref name=Bonito2010/> The fungus is an important component of the diet of [[northern flying squirrel]]s, and comprises the majority of their diet at certain times of the year.<ref name="urlFotM"/>

Some individuals have claimed to have had success in growing the truffles in [[Christmas tree farm]]s in Oregon.<ref name=Trudell2009/> Techniques reportedly involve inoculating the ground under young [[Douglas-fir]] trees with a slurry comprising ground-up truffles mixed in water, or the feces of animals fed truffles, but no concrete evidence shows these methods can be used to establish new truffle patches or to improve the productivity of existing patches.<ref name=Lefevre2001/>

== Uses ==
''Tuber oregonense'' is a choice [[edible mushroom|edible]] species.<ref name=":0" /> Its odor has been described as "truffly", a complex of garlic, spices, cheese, and "indefinable other essences"; the fungus is prized  by commercial truffle harvesters and consumers for its intense fragrance.<ref name="Trappe106-207">Trappe ''et al''., (1997). pp. 106–107.</ref> Because they grow in the topsoil and needles, they are considered to have a more "floral" and "herbal" flavor profile than related European truffles.<ref name=Mutic2010/>
