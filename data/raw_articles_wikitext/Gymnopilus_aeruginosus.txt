'''''Gymnopilus aeruginosus''''', also known as the '''magic blue gym''', is a [[mushroom]]-forming [[fungus]]. It has a rusty orange [[spore print]] and a bitter taste. Growing in clusters on dead wood, it is widely distributed and common in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It contains the psychedelic chemical [[psilocybin]].

== Taxonomy ==
The species was given its current name by mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] in 1951.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Singer |first1=R. |year=1951 |title=The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy |series=Lilloa |volume=22 |page=560}}</ref>

The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''aeruginosus'' refers to the bluish staining caused by [[psilocin]] polymerization.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{Convert|5–15|cm|frac=4}} across, convex<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/409/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=409 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> with an incurved margin and expands to broadly convex to almost plane in age. The top is dry, fibrillose, and scaly, often with a blueish-green tinge when young. The color is variable, often with various bluish-green, pink, or [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] patches. The cap is sometimes cracked in age. The flesh is pallid to whitish, sometimes turning buff or pinkish-buff in age. The scales are tawny or reddish becoming dark brown.

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are close or crowded, and broad. They are buff to yellow-orange or ochre, and [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] to [[wikt:adnate|adnate]]. They are at first slightly [[Lamella (mycology)|decurrent]], often seceding. The edges are even to slightly rough. The [[spore print]] is rusty to rusty-orange or rusty-cinnamon.<ref name="Arora1986" />

The stipe is 5–12&nbsp;cm long and 1–1.5&nbsp;cm thick, its width generally equal.<ref name="Arora1986" /> It is covered with [[wikt:appressed|appressed]] fibrils, soon disappearing. It is smooth, dry, dusted with rusty orange spores and has a cottony, scanty, yellowish, partially fibrillose veil that leaves an evanescent zone of hairs near the apex of the stipe. It is colored much like the cap;<ref name="Arora1986" /> it is flesh whitish, tinged greenish or bluish-green, becoming yellowish or pinkish-brown when dry. It is solid but becomes hollow and is sometimes striated.

The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are 6–9&nbsp;[[μm]] by 3.5–4.5&nbsp;μm and have no [[germ pore]]. They are roughened and elliptical. [[Pleurocystidia]] are rare and [[clamp connection]]s are present. The [[basidia]] each have four spores.

''Gymnopilus harmoge'' is a possible synonym and ''[[Gymnopilus punctifolius|G.&nbsp;punctifolius]]'' is a similar color, but with a bald cap and no veil.<ref name="Arora1986" />

==Habitat and formation==

''Gymnopilus aeruginosus'' grows gregariously to cespitosely on stumps, logs, and woodchip mulch/sawdust on hardwood and conifers. It grows in spring, fall, and winter, and is common in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It also grows in some of the southern states of the United States, such as [[Tennessee]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It is also found in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]].<ref>[https://www.gbif.org/species/2533711 Occurrences of ''Gymnopilus aeruginosus''], Global Biodiversity Information Facility</ref>

== Psychoactivity ==
The species is [[Psilocybin mushroom|psychoactive]], apparently containing the hallucinogenic drugs [[psilocybin]] and psilocin.<ref name="Arora1986" />
