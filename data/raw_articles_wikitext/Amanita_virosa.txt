'''''Amanita virosa''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the class [[Agaricomycetes]]. In the UK, it has the recommended English name of '''destroying angel'''<ref>{{cite web |author=Holden L. |url=https://www.britmycolsoc.org.uk/field_mycology/english-names |title=English names for fungi April 2022 |date=April 2022|publisher=[[British Mycological Society]] |accessdate=2024-04-10}}</ref> and is known internationally as the '''European destroying angel'''.<ref name="Amanitaceae">{{cite web |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20virosa |title=Amanitaceaw.org |accessdate=2024-04-10}}</ref> [[Basidiocarps]] (fruit bodies) are [[agaric|agaricoid]] (mushroom-shaped) and pure white with a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the stem and a sack-like [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base.

==Taxonomy==
''Amanita virosa'' was first described in 1838 by Swedish [[mycologist]] [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus virosus'', but this name is [[nom. illegit.|illegitimate]] since it had already been used for an earlier and different species. ''Amanita virosa'' was legitimately published by French mycologist Louis-Adolphe Bertillon in 1866. 

==Etymology==
The specific epithet is derived from the [[Latin]] adjective ''virōsus'' meaning 'toxic'<ref>{{cite book |last=Simpson |first=D.P. |title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary |publisher=Cassell Ltd. |year=1979 |isbn=978-0-304-52257-6 |edition=5 |location=London |pages=883}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Nilson |first=Sven |title=Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi |author2=Olle Persson |publisher=Penguin |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-14-063006-0 |page=54}}</ref> (compare [[virus]]).

==Description==

''Amanita virosa'' first appears as a white, egg-shaped object covered with a universal [[Veil (botany)|veil]]. As it expands, the mushroom-shaped fruit body breaks free, though ragged patches of veil may persist at the cap edges. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially conical with inturned edges, before becoming hemispherical and flattening with a diameter up to {{convert|12|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}}. The cap often has a distinctive boss; it is able to be peeled and is white, though the centre may be ivory. The crowded, free [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white, as is the stipe and [[Volva (mycology)|volva]]. The thin [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is up to {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, with a hanging, grooved ring. The [[spore print]] is white and the spores are subglobose and 7–10&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] long. They are [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], staining purple with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The flesh is white, with a smell reminiscent of radishes, and turns bright yellow with [[sodium hydroxide]].<ref name ="Zeitl">{{cite book|last=Zeitlmayr|first= Linus|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|pages=62–63|publisher=Garden City Press|location=Hertfordshire|isbn= 978-0-584-10324-3}}</ref>

===Similar species===
In Europe, the spring-fruiting ''[[Amanita verna]]'' is a similar all-white species, as is the autumn-fruiting, white form of ''[[Amanita phalloides]]'' (deathcap). Both are equally poisonous. In their immature, button-mushroom stage, all these poisonous species could be mistaken for young, white-capped, edible mushrooms (''[[Agaricus]]'' species), highlighting the danger of picking immature fruit bodies for food.

==Habitat and distribution==
''Amanita virosa'' is found in woodland in late summer and autumn, especially in association with [[beech]] and [[chestnut]], but also with [[pine]], [[spruce]], and [[fir]].<ref name="Amanitaceae"/> As with most ''[[Amanita]]'' species, it forms a mutually beneficial, [[mycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] relationship with the roots of these trees. ''Amanita virosa'' was originally described from Sweden and is known throughout Europe, with additional confirmed records from northern Asia (China). The name was formerly used for similar-looking agarics in North America, but research has shown that these American species, including the eastern ''[[Amanita bisporigera]]'', the western ''[[Amanita ocreata|A. ocreata]]'', and the northern ''[[Amanita amerivirosa]]'', are distinct.<ref name="Amanitaceae"/>

==Toxicity==


''Amanita virosa'' is highly toxic, and has been responsible for severe [[mushroom poisoning]]s.<ref name="benjamin" /> Eating just one cap of ''A. virosa'' is enough to kill an adult human.<ref name=benjamin>{{cite book|last1=Benjamin|first1=Denis R|title=Mushrooms: Poisons and Panaceas : a Handbook for Naturalists, Mycologists, and Physicians|date=1995|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=978-0716726494|pages=198–241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOVlQgAACAAJ|ref=benjamin}}</ref> The symptoms of poisoning generally come several hours after consumption, a delay which may make treatment more difficult.  

Fruit bodies contain both [[amatoxin]]s and [[phallotoxin]]s.

Amatoxins consist of at least eight compounds with a similar structure, that of eight amino-acid rings; they were isolated in 1941 by [[Heinrich Otto Wieland|Heinrich O. Wieland]] and Rudolf Hallermayer of the [[University of Munich]].<ref name="Litten75">{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0375-90 |last=Litten|first= W. |date=March 1975 |title=The most poisonous mushrooms |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=232 |issue=3 |pages=90–101 |pmid=1114308|bibcode=1975SciAm.232c..90L}}</ref> Of the amatoxins, [[α-Amanitin]] is the chief component and along with [[β-Amanitin]] is probably responsible for the toxic effects.<ref name="Koppel">{{cite journal |author=Köppel C |title=Clinical symptomatology and management of mushroom poisoning |journal=Toxicon |volume=31 |issue=12 |pages=1513–40 |year=1993 |pmid=8146866 |doi=10.1016/0041-0101(93)90337-I|bibcode=1993Txcn...31.1513K }}</ref><ref name="dart">{{cite book |last=Dart| first= RC |chapter=Mushrooms |title=Medical toxicology |publisher=Williams & Wilkins| location=Philadelphia |year=2004|pages=1719–35| isbn=978-0-7817-2845-4}}</ref> Their major toxic mechanism is the inhibition of [[RNA polymerase II]], a vital enzyme in the synthesis of [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA), [[microRNA]], and small nuclear RNA, ([[snRNA]]).

Phallotoxins consist of at least seven compounds, all of which have seven similar peptide rings. [[Phalloidin]] was isolated in 1937 by [[Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen|Feodor Lynen]], Heinrich Wieland's student and son-in-law, and Ulrich Wieland of the University of Munich. Though phallotoxins are highly toxic to liver cells,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wieland T, Govindan VM |title=Phallotoxins bind to actins |journal=FEBS Lett. |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=351–53 |year=1974 |pmid=4429639|doi=10.1016/0014-5793(74)80404-7|s2cid=39255487 |doi-access=free |bibcode=1974FEBSL..46..351W }}</ref> they have since been found to have little input into the destroying angel's toxicity as they are not absorbed through the gut.<ref name=" Karlson-Stiber"/> Furthermore, phalloidin is also found in the edible ''[[Amanita rubescens]]''.<ref name="Litten75"/> Another group of minor active peptides are the virotoxins, which consist of six similar monocyclic heptapeptides.<ref name = "Vetter">{{cite journal|first=János| last=Vetter|date=January 1998| title=Toxins of ''Amanita phalloides''| journal=Toxicon| volume=36| issue=1 |pages=13–24|pmid=9604278| doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(97)00074-3| bibcode=1998Txcn...36...13V}}</ref> Like the phallotoxins they do not exert any acute toxicity after ingestion in humans.<ref name=" Karlson-Stiber"/>

It is unclear why this fungus, which closely resembles edible species, has been implicated in fewer deaths than the [[death cap]], though its comparative rarity may contribute to this.<ref name = "Ramsbottom53">{{cite book | author = Ramsbottom J | year = 1953 | title = Mushrooms & Toadstools |page=39 | publisher = Collins | isbn = 978-1-870630-09-2}}</ref> Some authorities strongly advise against putting fruit bodies in the same basket with those collected for the table and to avoid handling them.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jordan|first1=Peter|last2=Wheeler|first2=Steven|title=The Ultimate Mushroom Book|date=2001|publisher=Hermes House|location=London|isbn=978-1-85967-092-7|page=99}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Carluccio A | year = 2003 | title = The Complete Mushroom Book | publisher = Quadrille | location = London|pages = 224| isbn = 978-1-84400-040-1}}</ref> 

===Treatment===
Consumption of ''Amanita virosa'' is a [[medical emergency]] requiring hospitalization. There are four main categories of therapy for poisoning: preliminary medical care, supportive measures, specific treatments, and [[liver transplantation]].<ref name="Enjalbert">{{cite journal |vauthors=Enjalbert F, Rapior S, Nouguier-Soulé J, Guillon S, Amouroux N, Cabot C |title=Treatment of amatoxin poisoning: 20-year retrospective analysis |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=715–57 |year=2002 |pmid=12475187 |doi=10.1081/CLT-120014646|s2cid=22919515 }}</ref>

Preliminary care consists of gastric decontamination with either [[activated carbon]] or [[gastric lavage]]. However, due to the delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment many hours after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions.<ref name="Enjalbert"/><ref name="Vesconi">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vesconi S, Langer M, Iapichino G, Costantino D, Busi C, Fiume L |title=Therapy of cytotoxic mushroom intoxication |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=402–6 |year=1985 |pmid=3987318 |doi=10.1097/00003246-198505000-00007|s2cid=23016936 }}</ref> Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of [[metabolic acidosis]], hypoglycemia, [[electrolyte]] imbalances, and impaired coagulation.<ref name="Enjalbert"/>

No definitive antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, but some specific treatments have been shown to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous [[Penicillin#Benzylpenicillin .28penicillin G.29|penicillin G]] has been reported to be of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown,<ref name="Floer82">{{cite journal| last1=Floerscheim| first1=G.L.| first2=O. |last2=Weber |first3=P. |last3=Tschumi |first4=M. |last4=Ulbrich|date=August 1982|title=Die klinische knollenblatterpilzvergiftung (''Amanita Phalloides''): prognostische faktoren und therapeutische massnahmen (Clinical death-cap (''Amanita phalloides'') poisoning: prognostic factors and therapeutic measures.)| journal=Schweizerische Medizinische Wochenschrift |volume=112 |issue=34 |pages=1164–77 |pmid=6291147|language=de}}</ref> and trials with [[cephalosporin]]s show promise.<ref name="benjamin" /><ref>{{cite journal|author=Neftel, K.|date=January 1988|title=(Are cephalosporins more active than penicillin G in poisoning with the deadly ''Amanita''?)|journal=Schweizerische Medizinische Wochenschrift|volume=118| issue=2|pages=49–51|pmid=3278370|language=de|display-authors=etal}}</ref> There is some evidence that intravenous [[silibinin]], an extract from the [[Silybum marianum|blessed milk thistle]] (''Silybum marianum''), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning.
