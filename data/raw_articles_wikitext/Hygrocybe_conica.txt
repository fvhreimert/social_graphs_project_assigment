'''''Hygrocybe conica''''' is a [[species]] of [[agaric]] (gilled mushroom) in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Hygrophoraceae]]. In the UK it has been given the recommended English name of '''blackening waxcap''',<ref name="BMS" /> since all parts of the [[basidiocarp]] (fruit body) blacken with age. In North America it is commonly known as the '''witch's hat''', '''conical wax cap''' or '''conical slimy cap'''. ''Hygrocybe conica'' is known to be a [[species complex|complex]] of at least eleven closely related species<ref name="Cannon" /> and as such is widespread in Eurasia, North America, and elsewhere.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] from Bavaria in 1774 by German polymath [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]], who named it ''Agaricus conicus''.<ref name="Schaeffer 1774"/> [[Paul Kummer]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Hygrocybe]]'' in 1871.<ref name="Kummer 1871"/> Recent [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] research, based on [[cladistic]] analysis of [[DNA sequences]], has confirmed that ''Hygrocybe conica'' belongs in ''[[Hygrocybe]]'' [[sensu stricto]].<ref name="Lodge 2014"/> However, it has also indicated that the name is currently applied to at least eleven closely related but genetically distinct taxa worldwide.<ref name=Cannon/>

==Description==
[[Basidiocarp]]s are [[agaricoid]], the cap narrowly conical at first becoming [[umbo (mycology)|umbonate]] and often lobed, up to {{Convert|10|cm|frac=4}} across. The cap surface is smooth and finely fibrillose, moist or viscid at first, variously yellow to orange or scarlet. The [[lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] (gills) are waxy, white to pale yellow or greyish. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (stem) is up to {{Convert|20|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} long,<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/116/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=116-117 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> smooth but fibrillose and streaky, yellow to orange-red, whitish towards base, lacking a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]].

A number of other species in the genus may appear similar.<ref name="audu" />

==Distribution and habitat==
''Hygrocybe conica'' is widely distributed across North America, Europe, and Asia, as well as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], being found in summer and autumn. In Europe, it is typical of [[waxcap grassland]]s, a declining habitat due to changing agricultural practices. It is one of the commonest waxcaps, however, and is also found in dunes, road verges, and other habitats.<ref name=Boertmann/> In North America it is often found in [[conifer]] woodland.<ref name=Miller/> Though ''H.&nbsp;conica'' occurs in Australia, principally near urban areas, many collections originally assigned to this species are the similar ''[[Hygrocybe astatogala|H. astatogala]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author= Young AM| year =2005 | title = Fungi of Australia: Hygrophoraceae | publisher = (Australian Biological Resources Study) CSIRO |location= Canberra, ACT | isbn = 978-0-643-09195-5}}</ref>

==Edibility==
The edibility of ''H. conica'' is unknown and it may be [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].<ref name="Miller2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=62}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Nilsson S, Persson O| year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin |location= New York, New York | isbn = 978-0-14-063006-0 }}</ref> [[David Arora]] suggests that reported poisonings may have been caused by other species, but that ''H.&nbsp;conica'' may cause minor adverse effects (such as lightheadedness) and is unsubstantial.<ref name="Arora1986" />
