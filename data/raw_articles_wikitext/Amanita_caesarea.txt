'''''Amanita caesarea''''', commonly known as  '''Caesar's mushroom''', is a highly regarded [[edible mushroom]] in the genus ''[[Amanita]]'', native to southern Europe and North Africa. While it was first [[species description|described]] by [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] in 1772, this mushroom was a known favorite of early rulers of the Roman Empire.

It has a distinctive orange [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], yellow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. Organic acids have been isolated from this species. Similar orange-capped species occur in North America and India.

Although it is edible, the Caesar's mushroom is closely related to the psychoactive [[fly agaric]], and to the deadly poisonous [[death cap]] and [[destroying angel]]s. These can easily be mistaken for ''A.&nbsp;caesarea'' and thus, presumed ''A.&nbsp;caesarea'' specimens must be identified with complete certainty before they can be assumed edible.

==Taxonomy==
''Amanita caesarea'' was first described by Italian mycologist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] in 1772 as ''Agaricus caesareus'',<ref>{{cite book |author=Scopoli JA. |title=Flora Carniolica exhibiens Plantas Carnioliae Indigenas et Distributas in Classes, Genera, Species, Varietates ordine Linnaeano.

Other common names include ''Amanite des Césars'' and ''Oronge''.

It has also been classified as ''A.&nbsp;umbonata''.  ''A.&nbsp;hemibapha'' is a similar species originally described from [[Sikkim]], [[India]]. It is widely eaten in the Himalayas and the Tibetan areas. Also North American collections have been labeled in the past as ''A.&nbsp;hemibapha''. The relationship of the similar [[North America]]n species ''A.&nbsp;arkansana'' and ''[[Amanita jacksonii|A.&nbsp;jacksonii]]'' to ''A.&nbsp;caesarea'' is not clear. The edibility of some of these similar species is also unclear, though ''A.&nbsp;jacksonii'' is eaten by many and there have been no reports of illness from it. A similar mushroom can also be found in [[La Esperanza, Honduras]], where a festival is celebrated annually in its honor. ''A. caesarea'' was first domesticated in 1984.<ref>{{cite book |last=Chang |first=Philip G.

==Description==


This mushroom has an orange-red [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], initially hemispherical before convex and finally flat. The surface is smooth, and margins striated, and it can reach {{convert|15|cm|round=0.5|abbr=off}} or rarely {{convert|20|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter. The free [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are pale to golden yellow, as is the cylinder-shaped [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], which is {{convert|8–15|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|2–3|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} wide. The [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] hangs loosely and is lined above and smooth below. The base of the stipe is thicker than the top and is seated in a greyish-white cup-like [[Volva (mycology)|volva]], which is a remnant of [[universal veil]]. The [[spore]]s are white.<ref name=Breit95>{{cite book|vauthors=Breitenbach J, Kränzlin F | year = 1995 | title = Fungi of Switzerland 4: Agarics, 2nd Part | isbn= 3-85604-240-7|page=146}}</ref>

It could be confused with the poisonous fly agaric (''[[Amanita muscaria]]''). Though ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' has a distinctive red cap dotted with fluffy white flakes, these tend to fall off as the mushroom<!-- /ˈkärpəˌfôr/ --> ages and the bright red tends to fade to a yellowy orange. The latter mushroom will always have white gills and stalk with a ringed volva<ref name=Breit95/> rather than a yellow stalk and is typically associated with spruce (''[[Picea]]''), pine (''[[Pinus]]'') or birch (''[[Betula]]'').<ref name=Breit95muscaria>{{cite book |vauthors=Breitenbach J, Kränzlin F | year = 1995 | title = Fungi of Switzerland 4: Agarics, 2nd Part | isbn= 3-85604-240-7|page=150}}</ref> Certain varieties (e.g. ''A.&nbsp;muscaria var. guessowii'') are close to yellow even at the juvenile stage.

===Chemical properties===
A study of isolates from the fruit bodies of ''A.&nbsp;caesarea'' showed that the radial growth (increases in axon's diameter) of this species was possible at pH 6–7, and optimal growth was in a temperature of {{convert|24-28|C|F|abbr=on}}, depending on the isolate.<ref name=daza>{{cite journal|last=Daza|first=A.|author2=Manjón, J. L.|author3= Camacho, M.|author4= Romero de la Osa, L.|author5= Aguilar, A.|author6= Santamaría, C.|title=Effect of carbon and nitrogen sources, pH and temperature on in vitro culture of several isolates of Amanita caesarea (Scop.:Fr.)

An investigation of the heavy metal content of mushroom samples found [[cadmium]] levels in ''A.&nbsp;caesarea'' four times greater than allowed in cultivated mushrooms by [[European Union]] standards. The amount of [[lead]] in ''A.&nbsp;caesarea'' also exceeded allowed levels. The study concluded that the accumulation of heavy metals may be a species-specific property of mushrooms, and that chronic consumption of some mushroom types could potentially be harmful.<ref name=cocchi>{{cite journal|last=Cocchi|first=Luigi|author2=Vescovi, Luciano|author3= Petrini, Liliane E.|author4= Petrini, Orlando|title=Heavy metals in edible mushrooms in Italy|journal=Food Chemistry|year=2006|volume=98|issue=2|pages=277–284|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2005.05.068}}</ref>

A study of the organic acid composition of mushrooms found a relatively high level, about 6 g/kg, in ''A.&nbsp;caesarea''. [[Malic acid]], [[ascorbic acid]], [[citric acid]], [[ketoglutaric acid]], [[fumaric acid]], [[shikimic acid]] and traces of [[succinic acid]] were detected. Malic and ascorbic acids were the most abundant compounds.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Valentão|first=Patrícia|author2=Lopes, Graciliana|author3=Valente, Miguel|author4=Barbosa, Paula|author5=Andrade, Paula B.|author6=Silva, Branca M.|author7=Baptista, Paula|author8= Seabra, Rosa M.|title=Quantitation of Nine Organic Acids in Wild Mushrooms|journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry|date=1 May 2005|volume=53|issue=9|pages=3626–3630|doi=10.1021/jf040465z|pmid=15853411|bibcode=2005JAFC...53.3626V |hdl=10198/939|hdl-access=free}}</ref> Ergosterol has also been isolated from ''A. caesarea''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Yokokawa|first=H.|author2=Mitsuhashi, T.|title=The sterol composition of mushrooms|journal=Phytochemistry|year=1981|volume=20|issue=6|pages=1349–1351|doi=10.1016/0031-9422(81)80036-2|bibcode=1981PChem..20.1349Y }}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==


It is found in southern Europe and North Africa, particularly in the hills of northern Italy. It is thought to have been introduced north of the Alps by the Roman armies as it is most frequently found along old Roman roads.<ref name=Breit95/> The mushroom is also distributed in the Balkans, Hungary,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Zoltan K. |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Of The Vali Forest Central Hungary |journal= Botanikai Kozlemenyek |volume=73 |issue=1–2 |pages=49–72|issn=0006-8144|language=hu}}</ref> India,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Rishikesh M. |year=2003 |title=Some wild edible mushrooms of Siang valley: Arunachal Pradesh. |journal=Plant Archives |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=81–84|issn=0972-5210}}</ref> Iran<ref name="Asef 2020">{{cite book |author=Asef M.R. |title=Field guide of Mushrooms of Iran |publisher=Iran-Shanasi Press |location=Tehran|year=2020|page=360 |isbn=978-600-8351-42-9}}</ref> and China ([[Sichuan Province]]).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=WeiHong P, BingCheng G, Wei T, Yong G |year=2003 |title=Studies on economic mushrooms in Longmen mountain areas |journal= Southwest China Journal of Agricultural Sciences |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=36–41 |issn=1001-4829|language=zh}}</ref> Although the species is not known to exist in the United States and Canada, it has been collected in Mexico.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Castano-Meneses G, Quiroz-Robledo LN |year=2004 |title=Ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) associated with macromycetes fungus (Fungi: Basidiomycetes) in sierra de Taxco, Guerrero, Mexico |journal= Folia Entomologica Mexicana |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=79–86|issn=0430-8603}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Guzmán G, Ramirez-Guillen F |year=2001 |title=The ''Amanita caesarea''-complex |work=Bibliotheca Mycologica|publisher=J.&nbsp;Cramer|location=Berlin |volume=187 |isbn=978-3-443-59089-5 }}</ref>

In Europe, ''A. caesarea'' inhabits primarily [[oak]]<ref>E.g.

In warmer climates this mushroom fruits in higher oak woodlands, sometimes mixed with [[conifer]]s. Thus, in Mexico its natural habitat is oak, pine or fir forests at altitudes of {{convert|2200-3000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, where it prefers plains and can occur at slopes of 20 degrees.<ref name=poe>{{cite book|last=Poe|first=Melissa Renee|title=Wild Mushrooms, Forest Governance, and Conflict in the Northern Sierra of Oaxaca|year=2009|page=139}}</ref>

==Uses==
''A. caesarea'' is a highly appreciated [[edible mushroom]] in Europe. It is traditionally gathered and consumed in Italy, where it is known as ''ovolo'' or ''ovolo buono'' or "fungo reale".<ref>{{cite web |title=ovolo |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/ovolo/ |access-date=28 September 2013 |work=Enciclopedia Treccani |publisher=Treccani}}</ref> It has been traditionally taken as food in Mexico. There it is consumed roasted with a bit of the herb epazote, ''[[Dysphania ambrosioides]]''. The international export market developed in the 1990s.<ref name="poe" />
