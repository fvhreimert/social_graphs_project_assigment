'''''Amanita australis''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Amanitaceae]]. It produces small- to medium-sized [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]], with brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|9|cm|abbr=off|frac=4}} in diameter covered with pyramidal warts. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are white, closely crowded together, and free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The stem, up to {{convert|9|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} long, has a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and a bulbous base. The mushroom may be confused with another [[endemism|endemic]] New Zealand species, ''[[Amanita nothofagi|A.&nbsp;nothofagi]]'', but can be distinguished by differences in microscopic characteristics.

The species was first described by New Zealand mycologist [[Greta Stevenson]] in 1962, along with a purported unique species which 30 years later was reduced to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] with ''A.&nbsp;australis''. The species is found only in [[New Zealand]], where it occurs in ''[[Leptospermum]]'' and ''[[Nothofagus]]'' forests.

==Taxonomy==
''Amanita australis'' was first [[species description|described]] by [[Greta Stevenson]] in 1962, based on specimens she collected in April 1954 around [[Lake Rotoiti, Tasman|Lake Rotoiti]] in [[Nelson Lakes National Park]], in New Zealand. In the same publication, Stevenson described ''Limacella macrospora'', collected in 1952 at [[Eastbourne, New Zealand#Days Bay|Day's Bay]] near [[Wellington]]. Stevenson thought this was a new species different from any previously described ''[[Limacella]]'' because of its larger size and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] spores.<ref name="Stevenson1962" /> Austrian mycologist [[Egon Horak]] later transferred it to the genus ''[[Oudemansiella]]'', but did not provide a reason for making the new combination.<ref name="Horak1971" /> In 1986, Pegler and Young proposed a classification for ''Oudemansiella'' based largely on [[spore]] structure, but they excluded ''O.&nbsp;macrospora'', considering it a species of ''[[Amanita]]''.<ref name="Pegler1986" /> [[Geoff Ridley]] examined Stevenson's [[holotype]] material and reduced ''L.&nbsp;macrosporus'' to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] with ''A.&nbsp;australis'' in 1993, explaining: <blockquote>The size, shape and amyloid reaction of the spores, the dimensions of the basidia, the presence of clamp connections and lamella margin cells indicate that this is ''Amanita australis'' Stevenson and easily fits into the concept of this taxon. ... Macroscopically the specimen lacks the typical pronounced basal bulb to the stipe and volva remnants on the pileus; however, it is not an unknown condition in this taxon.<ref name=Ridley1993/></blockquote>

Although Stevenson originally placed the species in ''Amanita'' [[section (biology)|section]] ''Phalloideae'' because of a perceived similarity to ''[[Amanita citrina|A.&nbsp;citrina]]'', it is now [[classification (biology)|classified]] in section ''Validae''; many species in this section have bulbous stem bases.<ref name="urlAmanita Sect. Validae - species list"/> Ridley suggests an appropriate [[common name]] would be the "straw flycap",<ref name=Ridley2004/> while Rodham Tulloss calls it the "far south Amanita".<ref name="urlAmanita australis G. Stev."/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''australis'' means "southern".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita%20australis |title=''Amanita australis'' G.

The shape of the ''A.&nbsp;australis'' [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex, later flattening out or even developing a central depression, and reaching diameters of {{convert|2-9|cm|abbr=off|frac=4}} wide. The cap margin sometimes splits and rolls back to give a ragged appearance. The centre of the cap is dark [[buff (color)|buff]], honey or [[isabelline (colour)|isabelline]], becoming paler to buff at the margin. The surface is sticky when young or wet, but dries out with age. The remnants of the [[volva (mycology)|volva]] form conical to pyramidal warts that are most densely aggregated in the center, but become sparse and low towards the margin. They are initially white then greyish-[[sepia (color)|sepia]] or isabelline with white to buff tips.<ref name="Ridley1991" />

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded closely together, free from attachment to the stem, {{convert|6|–|10|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide, and white. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) have truncated ends. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|37|–|90|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} tall, {{convert|6|–|26|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} in diameter, and narrowest at center. It is hollow, and has an abruptly bulbous base that is between {{convert|14|and|38|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} in diameter. The surface of the stem above the level of the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is white and covered in woolly tufts of mycelia; below the ring it is white with buff to greyish transverse, grooved bands. The base may or may not have a rim of volval remnants that are powdery, and a greyish-buff to greyish-sepia colour. The [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is membranous, white to buff, first hanging freely then later adhering to the stem. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap is white, occasionally pale isabelline under the center of the cap; the flesh of the stem is white.<ref name="Ridley1991" />

The [[spore print]] is white. The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are typically 9–12 by 8–10.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], spherical to [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and thin-walled. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent), and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]—meaning they will [[staining|stain]] bluish-black to black in [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] are 43.5–76.5 by 10.5–17&nbsp;μm, mostly four-spored, and clamped at their bases. There are abundant spherical, elliptic or club-shaped hyaline cells on the gill edges, measuring 16–39.5 by 10.5–27.5&nbsp;μm. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is 220–270&nbsp;μm wide, consisting of a [[gelatin]]ised suprapellis (upper layer) and non-gelatinised subpellis (lower layer). The volval remnants on the cap consist of abundant spherical, club-shaped, or [[wikt:napiform|turnip-shaped]] cells, measuring 10–86 by 9–85&nbsp;μm. These cells are [[umber]] in colour, and arranged in chains perpendicular to the cap surface, becoming smaller and paler at tip of the wart, subtended by moderately abundant hyphae that are 4–10&nbsp;μm wide. [[Clamp connection]]s are abundant in the hyphae.<ref name="Ridley1991" />

===Similar species===

''A. australis'' mushrooms that have lost their warts and have had the colours faded may resemble another New Zealand species, ''[[Amanita nothofagi|A.&nbsp;nothofagi]]''. The two species may be distinguished reliably using microscopy—''A.&nbsp;nothofagi'' does not have clamp connections at the base of the basidia, unlike ''A.&nbsp;australis''.<ref name="Ridley1991" /> ''A.&nbsp;australis'' also bears some resemblance to the eastern North American and east Asian species ''[[Amanita abrupta|A.&nbsp;abrupta]]'',<ref name="urlAmanita australis G. Stev." /> which also has an abruptly bulbous stem base.<ref name="urlAmanita abrupta (MushroomExpert.Com)" />

==Distribution and habitat==
''A. australis'' is found only on the north and south islands of New Zealand, where it grows in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association with  [[southern beech]] (genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'') (including [[Nothofagus fusca|New Zealand red beech]], [[silver beech]], [[Nothofagus solandri|New Zealand black beech]], [[hard beech]]),<ref name="Ridley1991" /> ''[[Leptospermum scoparium|mānuka]]'', and ''[[Kunzea ericoides|Kānuka]]''. The mushroom usually grows solitarily, but has on rare occasions been found growing in groups.<ref name="Ridley1991" />
