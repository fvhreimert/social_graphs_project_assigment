'''''Mycena multiplicata''''' is a species of [[mushroom]] in the family [[Mycenaceae]].<ref name=Fungorum/> First described as a new species in 2007, the mushroom is known only from the prefecture of [[Kanagawa]], Japan, where it grows on dead fallen twigs in lowland forests dominated by [[oak]]. The mushroom has a whitish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that reaches up to {{convert|13|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter atop a slender [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] {{convert|15|to|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|to|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick. On the underside of the cap are whitish, distantly spaced [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that are narrowly attached to the stem. Microscopic characteristics of the mushroom include the [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] spores (which turn bluish-black to black in the presence of [[Melzer's reagent]]), the pear-shaped to broadly club-shaped cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the gill edge) which are covered with a few to numerous, unevenly spaced, cylindrical protuberances, the lack of pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face), and the [[diverticulum|diverticulate]] [[Hypha|hyphae]] in the outer layer of the cap and stem. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown.

==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==
The mushroom was first collected by Japanese mycologist Haruki Takahashi in 1999, and reported as a new species in a 2007, along with seven other Japanese Mycenas. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''multiplicata'', meaning "multiplicative". Its Japanese name is ''Keashi-ochiedatake'' (ケアシオチエダタケ).<ref name=Takahaski2007/>

Takahashi suggests that the mushroom is best [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Mycena'' of the genus ''[[Mycena]]'', as defined by Dutch ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus|Maas Geesteranus]].<ref name=Takahaski2007/><ref name=MaasGeesteranus1985/>

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;multiplicata'' is conical to convex to bell-shaped, reaching {{convert|7|to|13|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. It is often shallowly grooved toward the margin, dry, and somewhat [[hygrophanous]] (changing color when it loses or absorbs water). The cap surface is initially [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (appearing as if covered with a fine white powder), but soon becomes smooth. The cap color is whitish, sometimes pale brownish at the center. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to 0.3&nbsp;mm thick, and does not have any distinctive taste or odor. The slender [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|15|to|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|to|1.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, centrally attached to the cap, and hollow. Its surface is dry, pruinose near the top, and covered with fine, soft hairs toward the base. It is whitish to grayish-violet near the top, gradually becoming dark violet below. The stem base is covered with long, fairly coarse, whitish fibrils. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are narrowly attached to the stem, distantly spaced (between 13 and 16 gills reach the stem), up to 1.7&nbsp;mm broad, thin, and whitish, with the gill edges the same color as the gill faces. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom has not been determined.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
The [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], thin-walled, smooth, colorless, [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 8–9.5 by 4&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are 24–31 by 6.5–7.5&nbsp;μm, club-shaped, four-spored, and have clamps at the basal [[septum|septa]]. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are abundant, pear-shaped to broadly club-shaped, and measure 17–28 by 11–20&nbsp;μm. They are covered with a few to numerous [[wikt:excrescence|excrescences]] (outgrowths) that are 2–18 by 1–3&nbsp;μm, colorless, and thin-walled. The excrescences are unevenly spaced, simple to somewhat branched, cylindrical, and straight or curved. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) in this species. The [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] (gill-producing) tissue is made of thin-walled [[hypha]]e that are 7–20&nbsp;μm wide, cylindrical (but often inflated), smooth, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and [[dextrinoid]] ([[staining]] reddish to reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent). The [[Pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 3–5&nbsp;μm wide, cylindrical, and covered with simple to highly branched colorless [[diverticulum|diverticulae]] that have thin walls. The layer of hyphae underneath the cap cuticle have a parallel arrangement, and are hyaline and dextrinoid, and made of short and inflated cells that are up to 52&nbsp;μm wide. The stem cuticle is made of parallel, bent-over hyphae that are 2–10&nbsp;μm wide, cylindrical, diverticulate, colorless or pale violet, dextrinoid, and thin-walled. The caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) are 2–6&nbsp;μm wide, and otherwise similar in appearance to the cheilocystidia. The stem tissue is made of longitudinally arranged, cylindrical hyphae measuring 5–13&nbsp;μm wide that are smooth, hyaline, and dextrinoid. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the cap cuticle and flesh, and at the [[septum|septa]] at the base of the basidia.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>

===Similar species===
Within the section ''Mycena'', ''M.&nbsp;multiplicata'' is similar to the Malaysian species ''[[Mycena obcalyx|M.&nbsp;obcalyx]]'' in having a grayish-white cap, lobed [[cheilocystidia]] with finger-like outgrowths, and a [[lignicolous]] habitat. ''M.&nbsp;obcalyx'' may be distinguished by forming much smaller fruit bodies (with caps 2–4&nbsp;mm wide) with subdecurrent gills, a [[pruinose]] (dusty-looking), [[hyaline]] (glassy) white stem, and broadly ellipsoid spores.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Mycena multiplicata'' is known only from [[Kanagawa]], Japan. It is found growing solitary or scattered, on dead fallen twigs in lowland forests dominated by the [[oak]] species ''[[Quercus myrsinaefolia]]''  and ''[[Quercus serrata|Q.&nbsp;serrata]]''.<ref name=Takahaski2007/>
