It is [[saprobic]] on wood, like other ''[[Crepidotus]]'' species, but it can also decompose [[herbaceous]] forest litter. The species is characterized by large, punctate, [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] [[basidiospore|spores]], and the white, hairy [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]].

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''versutus'' is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word {{lang|la|versut}} (clever), which may be a reference to the ability of the fungus to correctly orient itself for growth depending on the position of its growing surface.<ref name="isbn0-8131-9039-8">{{cite book |author=Roody, William C. |title=Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Ky |year=2003 |page=19 |isbn=0-8131-9039-8 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=5HGMPEiy4ykC&dq=crepidotus+versutus&pg=PA19  Google Books]</ref> The [[basionym]] of this species is ''Agaricus versutus'' Peck 1878.<ref>Peck CH.

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] is typically 5–14&nbsp;mm in diameter, initially [[Resupination|resupinate]], then later turned up. It is attached [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsally]] or [[Lateral (anatomy)|laterally]]  to the substrate. Fan- or kidney-shaped, it is dry, white, and covered with a layer of soft hairs which may or may not be matted. The outer edge is rolled slightly inwards. The [[Trama (mycology)|context]] is thin, soft, and white. Both the odor and taste of this mushroom are mild.

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] radiate from an eccentric or lateral point of attachment, medium broad, and tend to swell in the middle. The gill spacing is sub-distant, with many short gills (lamellulae) that do not reach the attachment point. The gills are initially white, then later tinged a rusty-brown color. The spore print is cinnamon-brown in color.<ref name="isbn0-02-063690-3">{{cite book |author1=Sundberg, Walter |author2=Bessette, Alan |title=Mushrooms: A Quick Reference Guide to Mushrooms of North America (Macmillan Field Guides) |publisher=Collier Books |location=New York |year=1987 |page=54 |isbn=0-02-063690-3 }}</ref>

This species has no [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], although it may have a small [[tubercle]] attaching it to its growing surface.

===Microscopic features===

The [[basidiospore]]s  are 7–11 x 4.5–6&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] in size, ellipsoid in shape, marked with very small spots, and yellowish to yellowish-brown under microscopic view. [[Basidia]] are 27–32 x 6–7&nbsp;μm and 4-spored. [[Pleurocystidia]] are absent. The [[cheilocystidia]] are 22–63 x 3–12&nbsp;μm, cylindric, and either swelling in the middle, or bottle-shaped. The gill trama are interwoven or at times subparallel, the [[hypha]]e 4–7&nbsp;μm in diameter. The generative tissue below the hymenium (subhymenium) is arranged in a parallel fashion. The cuticle (the outer layer of the fruiting body) is made of dense interwoven hyphae, connected to a tuft of colorless, long, slender (2.5–5&nbsp;μm diameter) hyphae. There are no [[clamp connection]]s in the epicuticular hyphae, but there are on the hyphae of the tomentum at the base of the pileus.

==Habitat and distribution==

This species may usually be found on the bark of [[deciduous]] wood in damp, shaded places. In the [[Pacific Northwest]], it is known to grow on ''[[Abies]]'', ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'' and ''[[Populus]]'' trees.<ref name="urlPacific Northwest Fungi Database">{{cite web |url=http://pnwfungi.wsu.edu/programs/searchFungusResultDetail.asp?fungusID=848 |title=Pacific Northwest Fungi Database |access-date=2008-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901131906/http://pnwfungi.wsu.edu/programs/searchFungusResultDetail.asp?fungusID=848 |archive-date=2006-09-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Similar species==

''Crepidotus applanatus'', the so-called "flat crep", is larger, with a shell-shaped cap, more closely spaced gills, and has conspicuous white [[mycelia]]l threads at the point of attachment.<ref name="isbn0-02-063690-3"/> ''C.&nbsp;herbarum'' has smaller spores and a pale-yellowish spore print.
