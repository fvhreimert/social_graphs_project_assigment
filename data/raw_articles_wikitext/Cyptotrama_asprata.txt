'''''Cyptotrama asprata''''' (alternatively spelled ''aspratum''), commonly known as the '''golden-scruffy collybia'''<ref name="urlAmericanMushrooms.com: Golden-scruffy Collybia (Cyptotrama asprata)">{{cite web |url=http://www.americanmushroom.com/taxa/Cyptotrama_asprata_03.htm |title=AmericanMushrooms.com: Golden-scruffy Collybia (''Cyptotrama asprata'') |access-date=2009-04-10}}</ref> or '''spiny woodknight''' <ref>{{Cite book |last=Ridley |first=Geoff |title=A photographic guide to mushrooms and other fungi of New Zealand. |publisher=New Holland |year=2006 |isbn=9781869661342 |location=Auckland, New Zealand |pages=50 |language=en}}</ref> is a [[saprobic]] species of [[mushroom]] in the family [[Physalacriaceae]]. This fungus has had a varied [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] history, having been placed in fourteen [[genus (biology)|genera]] before finally settling in ''[[Cyptotrama]]''.

It is characterized by the bright orange to yellow [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that in young specimens is covered with tufts of [[fibril]]s resembling small spikes. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus by variations in cap color, and [[spore]] size and shape. It is widely distributed in [[tropical]] regions of the world.

==History==
This species was first described from [[Ceylon]] by English naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] in 1847;<ref name="Berkeley 1847"/> soon after (1852), specimens were collected from [[South Carolina]] USA.<ref name="Ravenel 1852"/> Later, the fungus was described under a variety of names: ''Lentinus chrysopeplus'' from [[Cuba]];<ref name="Berkeley 1869"/> ''Agaricus sabriusculus'' and ''Agaricus lacunosa'' from New York;<ref name="Peck 1872"/><ref name="Peck 1873"/> ''Collybia lacunosa'' from Michigan;<ref name="Kauffman 1906"/> and ''Omphalia scabriuscula'' in Connecticut.<ref name="White 1910"/> As Canadian mycologists Redhead and Ginns explain in a 1980 article on the species, since its original 1847 description, ''C.&nbsp;asprata'' has been given 28 names, and placed in 14 different [[genera]].<ref name="Redhead 1980"/>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|0.6 to 2.7|cm|4=1}} in diameter, convex to cushion-shaped. The cap surface is dry, and younger specimens are covered with characteristic spikes; as the spikes break up with age, they tend to look more hairy or woolly. Older specimens typically have the surface features worn off. The cap margin tends to be rolled inwards when young, gradually becoming straight with maturity. The color of the cap is bright or pale yellow, increasing in intensity towards the center of the cap. ''C.&nbsp;asprata'' has a web-like ring that soon disappears.

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], pale yellow to white in color, are distantly spaced and have an adnate (squarely attached) or short decurrent (running down the length) attachment to the stem; they feel greasy when dried and crushed. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|1 to 6.7|cm|4=1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.2 to 0.4|cm|4=1|abbr=on}} thick at the stem apex; the stem is slightly thicker towards the base, and may be covered with [[hyphae]] that appear woolly (flocculose) or hairy (fibrillose). The surface of the stem may also be scaly – especially towards the base – or it may be covered with very small particles (granular). The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of this mushroom is white or pale yellow, with no distinctive taste or odor.<ref name="Redhead 1980"/> The [[spore print]] is white. It is considered inedible.<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=157|author-link=Orson K.

=== Similar species ===
Many other members of genus ''[[Cyptotrama]]'' are similar in appearance and differ from ''C.&nbsp;asprata'' by only one or two readily observable features. For example, ''C.&nbsp;granulosa'' is bright yellowish-brown (rather than bright or pale yellow in ''C.&nbsp;asprata''); ''C.&nbsp;lachnocephala'' is [[ochre]]-colored; ''C.&nbsp;deseynesiana'' is cream-colored with brown scales; ''C.&nbsp;verruculosa'' has a "copper-rust-brown" cap; ''C.&nbsp;costesii'' has olive-colored pigments. Species may also be distinguished by differences in spore size and shape, although a considerable size range has been noted for ''C.&nbsp;asprata'' spores.<ref name="Redhead 1980" /> ''[[Cyptotrama chrysopepla|C.&nbsp;chrysopepla]]'' and ''[[Heliocybe sulcata]]'' are also similar.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=448}}</ref>

=== Microscopic features ===
[[Spores]] are thin-walled, smooth, and [[ellipsoid]]al or oval in shape. Viewed with a [[microscope]], they appear translucent ([[hyaline]]), and stain red or blue with [[Melzer's reagent]] ([[inamyloid]]). Their dimensions are typically 7–10 by 5–7&nbsp;[[μm]]; the spores contain a single large oil droplet. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are club-shaped, two- to four-spored, and 25–30 by 5–7&nbsp;μm.<ref name="isbn962-201-556-5" /> The presence of sterile cells called [[pleurocystidia]] (large cells found on the gill face in some mushrooms) is uncommon; specimens may contain few or abundant cheilocystidia (large sterile cells found on the gill edge) that are club-shaped, thin-walled and 39–87.5 by 8.5–16&nbsp;μm in size.<ref name="Redhead 1980" />

==Habitat and distribution==
''Cyptotrama asprata'' is a [[saprobic]] fungus, and grows on the decaying wood of [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] trees. Host species include white fir (''[[Abies concolor]]''), sugar maple (''[[Acer saccharum]]'') and other maple (''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'') species, grey alder (''[[Alnus oblongifolia]]''), beech (''[[Beech|Fagus]]'') species, spruce (''[[Picea]]'') species, ponderosa pine (''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'') and other pine (''[[Pinus]]'') species, poplar (''[[Populus]]'') and oak (''[[Quercus]]'') species. In [[temperate]] North America, specimens are typically collected between July through September.<ref name="Redhead 1980"/>

The species has a [[pantropical]] distribution, and is widely distributed in tropical regions of the world.<ref name="Yang 1990"/> It has been collected from [[Australia]],<ref name="Smith 2005"/> southeastern [[Canada]],<ref name="urlCanadian Biodiversity: Species: Fungi: Golden-scruffy Collybia">{{cite web |url=http://canadianbiodiversity.mcgill.ca/english/species/fungi/shroompages/cyp_asp.htm |title=Canadian Biodiversity: Species: Fungi: Golden-scruffy Collybia |access-date=2009-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718220600/http://canadianbiodiversity.mcgill.ca/english/species/fungi/shroompages/cyp_asp.htm |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[China]],<ref name="isbn962-201-556-5">{{cite book |author=Ng LF-Y.|title=The Macrofungus Flora of China's Guangdong Province (Chinese University Press) |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |year=1993 |pages=292–93 |isbn=978-962-201-556-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=0cAered-vqYC&pg=PA292&dq=Cyptotrama+asprata&lr=#PPA293,M1 Google Books]</ref><ref name="Yang 1990"/> [[Costa Rica]],<ref name="urlINBio.
