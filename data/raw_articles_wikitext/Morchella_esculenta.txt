'''''Morchella esculenta''''' (commonly known as '''common morel''', '''morel''', '''yellow morel''', '''true morel''', '''morel mushroom''', and '''sponge morel''') is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Morchellaceae]] of the [[Ascomycota]].

Each [[Ascocarp|fruit body]] begins as a tightly compressed, grayish sponge with lighter ridges, and expands to form a large yellowish sponge with large pits and ridges raised on a large white [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The pitted yellow-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] measure {{convert|2–7|cm|frac=2|abbr=off}} broad by {{convert|2–10|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} tall, and are fused to the stem at its lower margin, forming a continuous hollow. The pits are rounded and irregularly arranged. The hollow stem is typically {{convert|2–9|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2–5|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} thick, and white to yellow.

The fungus fruits under hardwoods and conifers during a short period in the spring, depending on the weather, and is also associated with old orchards, woods and disturbed grounds. It is one of the most readily recognized of all the [[edible mushroom]]s and highly sought after.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was originally named ''Phallus esculentus'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753),<ref name="Fries1753" /> and given its current name by the mycologist [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801.<ref name="Persoon1801" />

''Morchella esculenta'' is [[common name|commonly]] known by various names: morel, common morel, true morel, morel mushroom, yellow morel, sponge morel,<ref name="Hanelt2001" /> Molly Moocher, haystack, and dryland fish.<ref name="Roody2003" /> In [[Nepal]] it is known as ''Guchi chyau''.<ref name="NRMP2000" /> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''esculenta'', meaning "edible".

The scientific name ''Morchella esculenta'' has been applied to many similar yellow morels throughout the world.  In 2014 Richard et al. used DNA analysis to restrict the ''M.&nbsp;esculenta'' name to a single species of yellow morel commonly found in Europe and also reported from China.<ref name="Richard2014" />  Other species of yellow morel, including those in North America, have received new scientific names.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is pale brownish cream, yellow to tan or pale brown to grayish brown. The edges of the ridges are usually lighter than the pits, and somewhat oval in outline, sometimes bluntly cone-shaped with a rounded top or more elongate. Caps are hollow, attached to the stem at the lower edge, and typically about {{convert|2–7|cm|frac=2|abbr=off}} broad by {{convert|2–10|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} tall. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is brittle. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is white to pallid or pale yellow, hollow, and straight or with a club-shaped or bulbous base. It is finely granular overall, somewhat ridged, generally about {{convert|2–9|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2–5|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Ammirati1987/> In age it may have brownish stains near the base.<ref name=Roody2003/>

===Development===
Fruit bodies have successfully been grown in the laboratory. R.&nbsp;Ower was the first to describe the developmental stages of ascomata grown in a controlled chamber.<ref name=Ower1982/> This was followed by in-depth cytological studies by Thomas Volk and Leonard (1989, 1990). To study the morel life cycle they followed the development of ascoma fruiting in association with tuberous begonias (''[[Begonia tuberhybrida]]''), from very small primordia to fully developed fruit bodies.<ref name=Volk1989/><ref name=Volk1990/>

Young fruit bodies begin development in the form of a dense knot of hyphae, when suitable conditions of moisture and nutrient availability conditions have been reached. Hyphal knots are underground and cup-shaped for some time, but later emerge from the soil and develop into a stalked fruiting body. Further growth makes the [[hymenium]] convex with the [[ascus|asci]] facing towards the outer side. Because of the unequal growth of the surface of the hymenium, it becomes folded to form many ridges and depressions, resulting in the sponge or honeycomb appearance.<ref name=Sharma1988/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
The [[spore]]s range from white to cream to slightly yellow in deposit, although a [[spore print]] may be difficult to obtain given the shape of the fruit body.<ref name=Hall2003/> The spores are formed in asci lining the pits—the ridges are sterile.<ref name="Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991"/> They are ellipsoidal, smooth, thin-walled, translucent ([[hyaline]]), and measure 17.5–21.9 by 8.8–11.0&nbsp;[[μm]]. The asci are eight-spored, 223–300 by 19–20&nbsp;μm, cylindrical, and hyaline. The [[paraphyses]] are filamentous, cylindrical, 5.8–8.8&nbsp;μm wide, and hyaline.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>

The [[hypha]]e of the stem are interwoven, hyaline, and measure 5.8–9.4&nbsp;μm wide. The surface hyphae are inflated, spherical to pear-shaped, 22–44&nbsp;μm wide, covered by a network of interwoven hyphae 11–16.8&nbsp;μm wide with recurved cylindrical hyphal ends.

=== Similar species ===
'', a poisonous ''M.&nbsp;esculenta'' lookalike]]

''Morchella esculenta'' is probably the most familiar of the morels. In contrast to ''[[Morchella angusticeps|M.&nbsp;angusticeps]]'' and its relatives, the caps are light-colored throughout development, especially the ridges, which remain paler than the pits. ''[[Morchella crassipes|M.&nbsp;crassipes]]'' is sometimes confused with ''M.&nbsp;esculenta''. According to Smith (1975), the two are distinct, but young forms of ''M.&nbsp;crassipes'' are difficult to separate from ''M.&nbsp;esculenta''. The two are similar in color, but ''M.&nbsp;crassipes'' is larger, often has thin ridges, and sometimes has a stem base that is enlarged and longitudinally grooved.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>

Stinkhorns, especially ''[[Phallus impudicus]]'', are also similar,<ref name=Arora1986/> but have a [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base of the stem and are covered with [[gleba]]—a slimy, foul-smelling spore mass.

The poisonous ''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'' is similar in appearance.

==Distribution and habitat==


The fruit bodies are sometimes solitary, but more often in groups, on the ground in a variety of habitats. A preference for soil with a [[limestone]] base (alkaline) has been noted,<ref name=Roody2003/> but they have also been found in [[soil pH|acidic soils]].<ref name=Metzler1992/>

The mushroom is usually found in early spring, in forests, orchards, yards, gardens and sometimes in recently burned areas.<ref name="Ammirati1987" /> In North America, it is sometimes referred to as the "May mushroom" due to its consistent fruiting in that month, but the time of fruiting varies locally, from February to July. It is typically the last morel species to fruit in locales where more than one species are found.<ref name="McKnight1987" /> For example, in northern Canada and in cooler mountainous regions, morels typically do not appear until June.<ref name="Bessette1992" /> It has been suggested that the springtime fruiting may be due to their ability to grow at low temperatures to the exclusion of competition,<ref name="Baker1979" /> a conclusion later corroborated by experiments correlating spore [[germination]] to soil temperatures.<ref name="Schmidt1983" />

One author suggests the acronym PETSBASH may be used to remember the trees associated with morels: [[pine]], [[elm]], [[Liriodendron|tulip]], [[sassafras]], [[beech]], [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[sycamore]], and [[hickory]].<ref name=Rosen1982/>

In North America, it is widely distributed, but especially common in eastern North America and the Midwest. [[David Arora]] notes that "large crops can also be found around the bases of dying (but not quite dead) elms attacked by Dutch elm disease."<ref name=Arora1986/> The species has been named state mushroom of [[Minnesota]], and was the first state mushroom of any state.<ref name="Minnesota">{{cite web |url= http://www.leg.state.mn.us/leg/symbols.aspx#mushroom|title= Minnesota State Symbols: Minnesota State Mushroom|publisher= [[Minnesota Legislature]]|access-date=June 13, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=1.149|title= 2010 Minnesota Statutes: 1.149 State Mushroom|publisher= Minnesota Office of the Revisor of Statutes|access-date=June 13, 2011}}</ref>

It can also be found in Brazil and Bulgaria.<ref name=Cortez2004/>

==Ecology==
Centipedes sometimes make their home inside these morels. Infested morels usually have a hole in the top.

==Cultivation==
Due to the mushroom's prized fruit bodies, several attempts have been made to grow the fungus in culture. In 1901, Repin reported successfully obtaining fruit bodies in a cave in which cultures had been established in flower pots nine years previously in 1892.<ref name=Repin1901/>

Mycologist Taylor Piercefield developed a method using beds of hardwood tree saplings which would be inoculated with mycelium, concentrating on the symbiotic relationship of ''Morchella esculenta''. Later, once the mycelium network had been fully developed, the beds would be treated with potassium hydroxide to replicate the pH conditions found in soil after a forest fire. This method resulted in large, mature fruits, but was not commercially viable on a large scale. More recently, small scale commercial growers have had success growing morels by using partially shaded rows of mulched wood.  The rows of mulch piles are inoculated with morel mushroom spores in a solution of water and molasses which are poured over the piles of mulch and then they are allowed to grow undisturbed for several weeks.  A solution of wood ashes mixed in water and diluted is subsequently poured over the rows of wood mulch which triggers fruiting of the morels.  Morels are known to appear after fires and the alkaline conditions produced by wood ash mixed with water initiate fruit body formation for most species of morels.<ref name="YouTube 2019 Growing Morels">{{cite web | title=YouTube | website=YouTube Growing Morels| date=2019-11-08 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTFugHA2WaI  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/lTFugHA2WaI |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live| access-date=2019-11-11}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

==Uses==
In [[Jammu and Kashmir (union territory)|Jammu and Kashmir]] wild mushrooms, locally known as Himalayan wild mushroom, Gucchi, ''[[Morchella conica]]'' and ''M.&nbsp;esculenta'', are gathered and supplied as [[medical remedy]].<ref>[http://jkmpic.blogspot.com/2015/03/wild-mushrooms-for-sale.html JK Medicinal Plants Introduction Centre]</ref>

===Edibility===


''Morchella esculenta'', like all morels, are among the most highly prized of all [[edible mushroom]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=361}}</ref> Raw morels have a gastrointestinal irritant, [[hydrazine]] (although this has not been isolated in samples), but [[parboil]]ing or [[Blanching (cooking)|blanching]] before consumption will remove it. Old fruit bodies that show signs of decay may be poisonous.<ref name=Hall2003/> The mushrooms may be fried in butter or baked after being stuffed with meats and vegetables.<ref name=Abel1993/> The mushrooms may also be dried by threading the caps onto string and hanging them in the sun; this process is said to concentrate the flavour.<ref name=Hall2003/> One study determined the main nutritional components to be as follows (on a [[Dry matter|dry weight]] basis): [[dietary protein|protein]] 32.7%, [[fat]] 2.0%, [[dietary fiber|fiber]] 17.6%, [[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]] 9.7%, and [[carbohydrate]]s 38.0%.<ref name=Wahid1988/>

===Bioactive compounds===
Both the fruit bodies and the mycelia of ''M.&nbsp;esculenta'' contain an uncommon [[amino acid]], ''cis''-3-amino-<small>L</small>-proline; this amino acid does not appear to be protein bound.<ref name=Hatanaka1969/> In addition to ''M.&nbsp;esculenta'', the amino acid is known to exist only in ''[[Morchella conica|M.&nbsp;conica]]'' and ''[[Morchella crassipes|M.&nbsp;crassipes]].''<ref name=Moriguchi1979/>

=== Industrial applications; solid-state fermentation ===
[[Solid-state fermentation]] is an industrial process to produce [[enzyme]]s and to upgrade the values of existing foods, especially foods from East Asia. Solid-state fermentation is a process whereby an insoluble substrate is fermented with sufficient moisture but without free water. Solid-state fermentation, unlike that of slurry state, requires no complex fermentation controls and has many advantages over submerged liquid fermentation. ''M.&nbsp;esculenta'' has shown promise in degrading [[starch]] and upgrading the nutritional value of cornmeal during solid-state fermentation.<ref name=Zhang2009/>

''M.&nbsp;esculenta'' mycelia is able to bind to and inhibit the effects of [[furanocoumarin]]s, chemicals found in [[grapefruit]] that inhibit human [[cytochrome p450]] enzymes and are responsible for the [[List of drugs affected by grapefruit|"grapefruit/drug" interaction phenomenon]].<ref name=Myung2008/>
