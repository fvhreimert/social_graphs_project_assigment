'''''Armillaria gallica''''' ([[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''A.&nbsp;bulbosa'' and ''A.&nbsp;lutea'') is a species of [[honey mushroom]] in the family [[Physalacriaceae]] of the order [[Agaricales]]. The species is a common and ecologically important [[wood-decay fungus]] that can live as a [[saprobe]], or as an opportunistic [[parasitism|parasite]] in weakened tree hosts to cause [[root rot|root]] or [[butt rot]]. It is found in [[temperateness|temperate]] regions of Asia, North America, and Europe. The species forms [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] singly or in groups in soil or rotting wood. The fungus has been inadvertently [[introduced species|introduced]] to South Africa. ''Armillaria gallica'' has had a confusing [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], due in part to historical difficulties encountered in distinguishing between similar ''Armillaria'' species. The fungus received international attention in the early 1990s when an individual [[colony (biology)|colony]] living in a [[Michigan]] forest was reported to cover an area of {{convert|15|ha}}, weigh at least {{convert|9.5|t|kg lb|sigfig=2}}, and be 1,500 years old. This individual is popularly known as the "humongous fungus", and is a tourist attraction and inspiration for an annual mushroom-themed festival in [[Crystal Falls, Michigan|Crystal Falls]]. Recent studies have revised the fungus's age to 2,500 years and its size to about {{convert|400|t|kg lb|sigfig=2}}, four times the original estimate.<ref name="si">{{cite web |author=Daley J |title=This Humongous Fungus Is as Massive as Three Blue Whales |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/mushroom-massive-three-blue-whales-180970549/ |website=Smithsonian.com |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |access-date=21 October 2018 |date=15 October 2018}}</ref>

''Armillaria gallica'' is a largely subterranean fungus, and it produces fruit bodies that are up to about {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, yellow-brown, and covered with small scales. On the underside of the [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] are [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that are white to creamy or pale orange. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] may be up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a white cobwebby [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] that divides the color of the stem into pale orange to brown above, and lighter-colored below. The fungus can develop an extensive system of underground root-like structures, called [[rhizomorphs]], that help it to efficiently decompose dead wood in [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]]. It has been the subject of considerable scientific research due to its importance as a [[plant pathogen]], its ability to [[bioluminescence|bioluminesce]], its unusual [[biological life cycle|life cycle]], and its ability to form large and long-lived [[clonal colony|colonies]].

Confusion has surrounded the [[binomial nomenclature|nomenclature]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the species now known as ''Armillaria gallica'', paralleling that surrounding the genus ''[[Armillaria]]''.<ref name=Termorshuizen1997/> The [[type species]], ''[[Armillaria mellea]]'', was until the 1970s believed to be a [[pleomorphism (microbiology)|pleiomorphic]] species with a wide distribution, variable pathogenicity, and one of the broadest [[host (biology)|host]] ranges known for the fungi.<ref name=Volk1995/> In 1973, [[Veikko Hintikka]] reported a technique to distinguish between ''Armillaria'' species by growing them together as single [[spore]] isolates on [[petri dish]]es and observing changes in the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the cultures.<ref name=Hintikka1973/> Using a similar technique, [[Kari Korhonen (biologist)|Kari Korhonen]] showed in 1978 that the European ''Armillaria mellea'' [[species complex]] could be separated into five reproductively isolated species, which he named "European Biological Species" (EBS) A through E.<ref name=Korhonen1978/> About the same time, the North American ''A.&nbsp;mellea'' was shown to be ten different species (North American Biological Species, or NABS I through X);<ref name=Anderson1979/> NABS VII was demonstrated shortly after to be the same species as EBS E.<ref name=Anderson1980/> Because several research groups had worked with this widely distributed species, it was assigned several different names.

The species that Korhonen called EBS&nbsp;B was named ''A.&nbsp;bulbosa'' by Helga Marxmüller in 1982,<ref name=Marxmuller1982/> as it was thought to be equivalent to ''Armillaria mellea'' [[variety (botany)|var.]] ''bulbosa'', first described by [[Jean Baptiste Barla]] (Joseph Barla) in 1887,<ref name=Barla1887/> and later raised to species status by [[Josef Velenovský]] in 1927.<ref name=Velenovsky1927/> In 1973, the French mycologist [[Henri Romagnesi]], unaware of Velenovský's publication, published a description of the species he called ''Armillariella bulbosa'', based on specimens he had found near [[Compiègne]] and [[Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte]] in France. These specimens were later demonstrated to be the same species as the EBS&nbsp;E of Korhonen; EBS&nbsp;B was later determined to be ''[[Armillaria cepistipes|A.&nbsp;cepistipes]]''.<ref name=Marxmuller1992/> Therefore, the name ''A.&nbsp;bulbosa'' was a misapplied name for EBS&nbsp;E. In 1987 Romagnesi and Marxmüller renamed EBS&nbsp;E to ''Armillaria gallica''.<ref name=Marxmuller1987/> Another [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]], ''A.&nbsp;lutea'', had originally been described by [[Claude Casimir Gillet]] in 1874,<ref name=Gillet1874/> and proposed as a name for EBS&nbsp;E.<ref name=Watling1987/><ref name=Termorshuizen1987/> Although the name had [[Principle of Priority|priority]] due to its early publication date, it was rejected as a ''[[nomen ambiguum]]'' because of a lack of supporting evidence to identify the fungus, including a specimen, [[type locality (biology)|type locality]], and incomplete collection notes.<ref name=Marxmuller1992/> ''A.&nbsp;inflata'' (Velenovský, 1920) may represent another synonym, but the type specimens were not preserved, so it is considered a dubious name (''[[nomen dubium]]'').<ref name=Antonin1990/> As of 2010, both the [[Index Fungorum]] and [[MycoBank]] consider ''Armillaria gallica'' Marxm. & Romagn. to be the current name, with ''A.&nbsp;bulbosa'' and ''A.&nbsp;lutea'' as synonyms.<ref name="urlSpecies Fungorum - Species synonymy"/><ref name="urlMycoBank, the fungal website"/>

[[Phylogenetic]] analysis of North American ''Armillaria'' species based on analysis of [[amplified fragment length polymorphism]] data suggests that ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' is most closely related to ''A.&nbsp;sinapina'', ''A. cepistipes'', and ''A. calvescens''.<ref name=Kim2006/> These results are similar to those reported in 1992 that compared sequences of nuclear [[ribosomal DNA]].<ref name=Anderson1992/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''gallica'' is botanical [[Latin]] for "French" (from ''Gallia'', "Gaul"),<ref name="OEDlatin"/> and refers to the [[Type locality (biology)#type locality|type locality]].<ref name=Stearn/> The prior name ''bulbosa'' is Latin for "bulb-bearing, bulbous" (from ''bulbus'' and the suffix -''osa'').<ref name="OEDlatin"/><ref name=Stearn/> ''Armillaria'' is derived from the Latin ''armilla'', or "bracelet".<ref name=Stager1999/>

==Description==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Armillaria gallica 57634.jpg|image2=Armillaria gallica 25558.jpg|width=200|caption1=Young fruit bodies have a cottony partial veil that protects the developing gills.|caption2=Mature gills|alt1=The underside of a mushroom cap showing whitish cottony tissue connecting the edge of the brown cap with the whitish stem.|alt2=The underside of a mushroom cap showing numerous closely spaced gills. A small ring of whitish cottony tissue can be seen at the stem where it attaches the cap.}}
The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''Armillaria gallica'' have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are {{convert|2.5|–|9.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad, and depending on their age, may range in shape from conical to convex to flattened. The caps are brownish-yellow to brown when moist, often with a darker-colored center; the color tends to fade upon drying. The cap surface is covered with slender fibers (same color as the cap) that are erect, or sloping upwards.

When the fruit bodies are young, the underside of the caps have a cottony layer of tissue stretching from the edge of the cap to the stem—a [[partial veil]]—which serves to protect the developing [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. As the cap grows in size the membrane is eventually pulled away from the cap to expose the gills. The gills have an adnate (squarely attached) to somewhat decurrent (extending down the length of the stem) attachment to the stem. They are initially white, but age to a creamy or pale orange covered with rust-colored spots. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4|–|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.6|–|1.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and almost club-shaped with the base up to {{convert|1.3|–|2.7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Above the level of the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], the stem is pale orange to brown, while below it is whitish or pale pink, becoming grayish-brown at the base. The ring is positioned about {{convert|0.4|–|0.9|cm|in|abbr=on}} below the level of the cap, and may be covered with yellowish to pale-brownish woolly cottony [[mycelium|mycelia]]. The base of the stem is attached to [[rhizomorph]]s, black root-like structures 1–3&nbsp;mm in diameter. While the primary function of the below-ground mycelia is to absorb nutrients from the soil, the rhizomorphs serve a more exploratory function, to locate new food bases.<ref name=Fox2000/><ref name=Mihail1995/>

===Microscopic features===
When the spores are seen in deposit, such as with a [[spore print]], they appear whitish. They have an [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] or [[wikt:oblong|oblong]] shape, usually contain an oil droplet, and have dimensions of 7–8.5 by 5–6&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidium|basidia]], are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 32–43 by 7–8.7&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Bas1995/> Other cells present in the fertile [[hymenium]] include the cheilocystidia ([[cystidium|cystidia]] present on the edge of a gill), which are club-shaped, roughly cylindrical and 15–25 by 5.0–12&nbsp;μm. Cystidia are also present on the stem (called caulocystidia), and are broadly club-shaped, measuring 20–55 by 11–23&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Antonin2009/> The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is made of [[hypha]]e that are irregularly interwoven and project upward to form the scales seen on the surface. The hyphae that make up the surface scales typically measure 26–88&nbsp;μm long by 11–27&nbsp;μm thick and can be covered with a crust of [[pigment]]. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of most tissues.<ref name=Bas1995/>

===Edibility===
Like all ''Armillaria'' species, ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' is considered [[edible mushrooms|edible]]. Thorough cooking is usually recommended, as the raw mushroom tastes [[wikt:acrid|acrid]] when fresh or undercooked.<ref name=Fox2000/> One author advises to consume only a small portion initially, as some people may experience an upset stomach.<ref name=Rogers/> The taste is described as "mild to bitter", and the odor "sweet",<ref name="urlArmillaria gallica (MushroomExpert.Com)"/> or reminiscent of [[camembert]] cheese.<ref name=Antonin2009/>

===Similar species===
''[[Armillaria calvescens]]'' is rather similar in appearance, and can only be reliably distinguished from ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' by observing microscopic characteristics. ''A.&nbsp;calvescens'' has a more northern distribution, and in North America, is rarely found south of the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name="urlArmillaria gallica (MushroomExpert.Com)"/> ''[[Armillaria mellea|A.&nbsp;mellea]]'' has a thinner stem than ''A.&nbsp;gallica'', but can be more definitively distinguished by the absence of clamps at the base of the basidia.<ref name="urlarmillaria mellea gallica"/> Similarly, ''A.&nbsp;cepistipes'' and ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' are virtually identical in appearance (especially older fruit bodies), and are identified by differences in geographical distribution, host range, and microscopic characteristics. [[Molecular biology|Molecular]] methods have been developed to discriminate between the two species by comparing [[DNA sequence]]s in the [[gene]] coding [[Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1|translation elongation factor 1-alpha]].<ref name=Antonin2009/>

===Metabolites===
''Armillaria gallica'' can produce [[cyclobutane]]-containing [[metabolite]]s such as arnamiol,<ref name=Gribble2009/> a [[natural product]] that is classified as a [[terpenoid|sesquiterpenoid]] [[aryl]] [[ester]].<ref name=Dervilla1986/> Although the specific function of arnamiol is not definitively known, similar chemicals present in other ''Armillaria'' species are thought to play a role in inhibiting the growth of antagonistic bacteria or fungi, or in killing cells of the host plant prior to infection.<ref name=Peipp1992/>

===Bioluminescence===
The [[mycelia]] and fruiting bodies of ''Armillaria gallica'' are known to be [[bioluminescent]]. Experiments have shown that the intensity of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth.<ref name=Mihail2007/> Bioluminescence is caused by the action of [[luciferase]]s, enzymes that produce light by the [[oxidation]] of a [[luciferin]] (a [[pigment]]).<ref name=Shimomura2010/> The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal,<ref name=Sivinski1981/> it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions,<ref name=Buller1924/> or it may help deter [[heterotroph]]s that might consume the fungus.<ref name=Sivinski1981/>

==Humongous fungus==

Researchers reported finding ''Armillaria gallica'' in the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]] in the early 1990s, during an unrelated research project to study the possible biological effects of [[extremely low frequency]] radio stations, which were being investigated as a means to communicate with submerged submarines. In one particular forest stand, ''Armillaria''-infected [[oak]] trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus, identified as ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' (then known as ''A.&nbsp;bulbosa''). Using [[molecular genetics]], they determined that the underground [[mycelium|mycelia]] of one individual fungal [[colony (biology)|colony]] covered {{convert|15|ha|abbr=on}}, weighing over {{convert|9500|kg|lb|sigfig=2}}, with an estimated age of 1,500 years.<ref name=Stamets2000/><ref name=Volk2002/> The analysis used [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP) and [[random amplification of polymorphic DNA]] (RAPD) to examine [[genetic isolate|isolates]] collected from fruit bodies and [[rhizomorph]]s (underground aggregations of fungal cells that resemble plant roots) along {{convert|1|km|mi|1|sp=us|adj=on}} [[transect]]s in the forest. The 15-hectare area yielded isolates that had identical [[mating type]] alleles and [[mitochondrial DNA]] [[restriction fragment]] patterns; this degree of genetic similarity indicated that the samples were all derived from a single genetic individual, or [[clone (cell biology)|clone]], that had reached its size through [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative growth]]. In their conclusion, the authors noted: "This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth."<ref name=Smith1992/> After the ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' paper was published, major media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found; as a result of this publicity, the individual acquired the [[common name]] "humongous fungus".<ref name=Volk2002/> There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other [[largest organism|large organisms]] such as the [[blue whale]] or the [[giant redwood]].<ref name=Wilson1999/>

The fungus has since become a popular tourist attraction in Michigan, and has inspired a "Humongous Fungus Fest" held annually in August in [[Crystal Falls, Michigan|Crystal Falls]].<ref name=Sceurman2010/> The organism was the subject of a [[Late Show Top Ten List]] on [[Late Night with David Letterman]],<ref name=Sieger2004/> and an advertising campaign by the rental company [[U-Haul]].<ref name=Volk2002/>

==Life cycle and growth==
The [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] of ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' includes two [[diploid]]ization–[[haploid]]ization events. The first of these is the usual process of [[karyogamy|cell fusion]] (forming a diploid) followed by [[meiosis]] during the formation of haploid [[basidiospore]]s.<ref name=Peabody1985/> The second event is more cryptic and occurs before fruit body formation. In most [[Basidiomycetes|basidiomycetous]] fungi, the hyphae of compatible [[mating type]]s will fuse to form a two-[[cell nucleus|nucleate]], or [[dikaryotic]] stage; this stage is not observed in ''Armillaria'' species, which have cells that are mostly monokaryotic and diploid. Genetic analyses suggest that the dikaryotic mycelia undergo an extra haploidization event prior to fruit body formation to create a [[genetic mosaic]].<ref name=Peabody2000/> These regular and repeating haploidization events result in increased [[genetic diversity]], which helps the fungus to adapt to unfavorable changes in environmental conditions, such as drought.<ref name=Peabody2003/><ref name=Peabody2005/><ref name=Gatto2009/>

The growth rate of ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' rhizomorphs is between {{convert|0.3|and|0.6|m|ft|abbr=on|1}} per year.<ref name=Rishbeth1991/> [[Population genetics|Population genetic]] studies of the fungus conducted in the 1990s demonstrated that genetic individuals grow [[mitosis|mitotically]] from a single point of origin to eventually occupy territories that may include many adjacent root systems over large areas (several [[hectare]]s) of forest floor.<ref name=Smith1992/><ref name=Rizzo1995/><ref name=Saville1996/> Based on the low [[mutation rate]]s observed in large, long-lived individuals, ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' appears to have an especially stable [[genome]].<ref name=Hodnett2000/> It has also been hypothesized that genetic stability may result from self-renewing mycelial repositories of nuclei with [[stem cell]]-like properties.<ref name=Gladfelter2009/>

Specific mechanisms of somatic growth have been proposed to explain how species such as ''A. gallica'' keep [[somatic mutation]]s in check, thus promoting their [[longevity]].<ref name="Aanen2014">{{Cite journal |last=Aanen |first=Duur K. |date=2014-11-21 |title=Developmental Biology. How a long-lived fungus keeps mutations in check |journal=Science |volume=346 |issue=6212 |pages=922–923 |doi=10.1126/science.1261401 |pmid=25414293|s2cid=206562924 }}</ref>  The common element of these mechanisms is asymmetric [[cell division]] in which a group of cells is maintained that divide infrequently and are thus less prone to replication errors leading to [[mutations]]. At the somatic growth front of ''A. gallica'' mutation rate was proposed to be kept low by cells dividing infrequently, but giving rise to cells behind the growth front that divide rapidly thus promoting tissue growth although at the expense of a higher mutation rate.<ref name = Aanen2014/>

==Habitat and distribution==

''Armillaria gallica'' can normally be found on the ground, but sometimes on stumps and logs.<ref name=Roody2003/> Mushrooms that appear to be terrestrial are attached to plant roots underneath the surface.<ref name="urlArmillaria gallica (MushroomExpert.Com)"/> It is widely distributed and has been collected in North America, Europe,<ref name=Rogers/> and Asia (China,<ref name=Qin2007/> Iran,<ref name=Asef2003/> and Japan<ref name=Ota2009/>). The species has also been found in the [[Western Cape]] Province of South Africa, where it is thought to have been [[introduced species|introduced]] from potted plants imported from Europe during the early colonization of Cape Town.<ref name=Coetzee2003/> In Scandinavia, it is absent in areas with very cold climates, like Finland or Norway, but it is found in southern Sweden. It is thought to be the most prevalent low altitude species of ''Armillaria'' in Great Britain and France. The upper limits of its altitude vary by region. In the French [[Massif Central (geology)|Massif Central]], it is found up to {{convert|1100|m|ft|abbr=on}}, while in Bavaria, which has a more [[continental climate]], the upper limit of distribution reaches {{convert|600|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Guillaumin1993/> In [[Serbia]]n forests, it is the most common ''Armillaria'' between elevations of {{convert|70|to|1450|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Keca2009/> [[Field study|Field studies]] suggest that ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' prefers sites that are low in [[organic matter]] and have high [[soil pH]]s.<ref name=Blodgett1992/><ref name=Oliva2009/>

In North America, it is common east of the [[Rocky Mountains]], but rare in the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=Ammirati2009/> In California, where it is widely distributed, the fungus is found in a variety of [[plant community|plant communities]], including aspen, coastal oak woodland, [[Douglas Fir]], [[Klamath National Forest|Klamath mixed conifer]], montane hardwood, montane hardwood-conifer, montane [[riparian zone|riparian]], Redwood, Sierran mixed conifer, [[valley oak]] woodland, valley-foothill riparian, and [[White Fir]].<ref name=Baumgartner2001/> It was found to be the most common ''Armillaria'' species in hardwood and mixed oak forests in western [[Massachusetts]].<ref name=Brazee2009/>

A Chinese study published in 2001 used the [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] technique [[restriction fragment length polymorphism]] to analyze the differences in [[DNA sequence]] between 23 ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. The results suggest that based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns observed, there are four global ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical [[lineage (evolution)|lineages]].<ref name=Qin2001/> A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of ''Armillaria'', using fruit body and pure culture morphology, concluded that there are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) that are similar to the common ''A.&nbsp;gallica''.<ref name=Qin2007/>

==Ecology==

''Armillaria gallica'' is a weaker [[plant pathogen|pathogen]] than the related ''A.&nbsp;mellea'' or ''[[Armillaria solidipes|A.&nbsp;solidipes]]'', and is considered a secondary parasite—typically initiating infection only after the host's defenses have been weakened by insect defoliation, drought, or infection by another fungus.<ref name=Marcais2006/> Fungal infection can lead to [[root rot]] or [[butt rot]].<ref name=Healy2008/> As the diseased trees die, the wood dries, increasing the chance of catching fire after being struck by lightning. The resulting forest fire may, in turn, kill the species that killed the trees.<ref name=Stamets2005/> Plants that are under [[moisture stress|water stress]] caused by dry soils or [[waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] are more susceptible to infection by ''A.&nbsp;gallica''.<ref name=Packham2007/> It has been shown to be one of several ''Armillaria'' species responsible for widespread mortality of [[oak]] trees in the Arkansas [[Ozark]]s.<ref name=Kelly2009/> The fungus has also been shown to infect [[Daylily]] in [[South Carolina]],<ref name=Schnabel2005/> [[Northern highbush blueberry]] (''Vaccinium corymbosum'') in Italy<ref name=Prodorutti2006/><ref name=Prodorutti2009/> and vineyards (''[[Vitis]]'' species) of [[Rías Baixas (DO)|Rías Baixas]] in northwestern Spain. The latter infestation "may be related to the fact that the vineyards from which they were isolated were located on cleared forestry sites".<ref name=AguinCasal2003/> When ''A.&nbsp;solidipes'' and ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' co-occur in the same forest, infection of root systems by ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' may reduce damage or prevent infection from ''A.&nbsp;solidipes''.<ref name="urlCFS:Armillaria gallica"/>


''Armillaria gallica'' can develop an extensive subterranean system of rhizomorphs, which helps it to compete with other fungi for resources or to attack trees weakened by other fungi. A field study in an ancient broadleaved woodland in England showed that of five ''Armillaria'' species present in the woods, ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' was consistently the first to colonize tree stumps that had been [[coppicing|coppiced]] the previous year.<ref name=Rishbeth1991/> [[Fractal geometry]] has been used to model the branching patterns of the hyphae of various ''Armillaria'' species. Compared to a strongly pathogenic species like ''A.&nbsp;solidipes'', ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' has a relatively sparse branching pattern that is thought to be "consistent with a foraging strategy in which acceptable food bases may be encountered at any distance, and which favours broad and divisive distribution of potential inoculum".<ref name=Mihail1995/> Because the rhizomorphs form regular [[network theory|networks]], mathematical concepts of [[graph theory]] have been employed to describe fungal growth and interpret ecological strategies, suggesting that the specific patterns of network attachments allow the fungus "to respond opportunistically to spatially and temporally changing environments".<ref name=Lamour2007/>

''Armillaria gallica'' may itself be parasitized by other [[soil life|soil flora]]. Several species of the fungus ''[[Trichoderma]]'', including ''[[Trichoderma polysporum]]'', ''[[Trichoderma harzianum|T.&nbsp;harzianum]]'' and ''[[Trichoderma viride|T.&nbsp;viride]]'', are able to attack and penetrate the outer tissue of ''A.&nbsp;gallica'' rhizomorphs and parasitize the internal hyphae. The infected rhizomorphs become devoid of living hyphae about one week after the initial infection.<ref name=Dumas1992/> ''[[Entoloma abortivum]]'' is another fungus that can live parasitically upon ''A.&nbsp;gallica''. The whitish-gray malformed fruit bodies that may result are due to the ''E.&nbsp;abortivum'' hyphae penetrating the mushroom and disrupting its normal development.<ref name=Czederpiltz2001/>
