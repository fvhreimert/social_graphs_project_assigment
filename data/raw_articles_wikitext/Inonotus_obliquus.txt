'''''Inonotus obliquus''''', commonly called '''chaga''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|ɡ|ə|}}; a [[Latinization (literature)|Latinization]] of the Russian word {{lang|ru|ча́га}}), is a [[fungus]] in the family [[Hymenochaetaceae]]. It is [[Parasitism|parasitic]] on [[birch]] and other trees. The sterile [[Polypore|conk]] is irregularly formed and resembles burnt charcoal. It is not the [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruiting body]] of the fungus, but a [[sclerotium]] or mass of [[mycelium]], mostly black because of a substantial amount of [[melanin]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Babitskaya|first1=VG|last2=Shcherba|first2=VV|last3=Lkonnikova|first3=NV |date=2000|title=Melanin complex of the fungus Inonotus obliquus|journal=Appl Biochem Microbiol|volume=36|issue=4|pages=377–381|doi=10.1007/BF02738046|s2cid=46047121}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Meuninck |first=Jim |title=Foraging Mushrooms Oregon: Finding, Identifying, and Preparing Edible Wild Mushrooms |date=2017 |publisher=[[Falcon Guides]] |isbn=978-1-4930-2669-2 |page=111}}</ref> It is commonly marketed as a [[dietary supplement]] for various health benefits but lacks sufficient [[scientific evidence]] for safety or effectiveness, and quality can vary due to inconsistent processing and labeling.<ref name="opss">{{cite web |title=Mushrooms in dietary supplements |url=https://www.opss.org/article/mushrooms-dietary-supplements |website=Operation Supplement Safety |publisher=Consortium for Health and Military Performance |date=2020-07-29 |access-date=2025-05-19}}</ref>

==Description==
''Inonotus obliquus'' causes a white [[heart rot]] to develop in the host tree. The chaga spores enter the tree through wounds, particularly poorly healed branch stubs. The white rot decay will spread throughout the [[heartwood]] of the host. During the infection cycle, penetration of the [[sapwood]] occurs only around the sterile exterior [[mycelium]] mass.<ref name="Lee 199–202">{{Cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Min-Woong |last2=Hur |first2=Hyeon |last3=Chang |first3=Kwang-Choon |last4=Lee |first4=Tae-Soo |last5=Ka |first5=Kang-Hyeon |last6=Jankovsky |first6=L. |date=December 2008 |title=Introduction to Distribution and Ecology of Sterile Conks of Inonotus obliquus |journal=Mycobiology |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=199–202 |doi=10.4489/MYCO.2008.36.4.199 |issn=1229-8093 |pmc=3755195 |pmid=23997626}}</ref> The chaga fungus will continue to cause decay within the living tree for 10–80+ years. While the tree is alive, only sterile mycelial masses are produced (the black exterior conk). The sexual stage begins after the tree, or some portion of the tree, is killed by the infection. ''I.&nbsp;obliquus'' will begin to produce fertile fruiting bodies underneath the bark. These bodies begin as a whitish mass that turn to brown with time. Since the sexual stage occurs almost entirely under the bark, the fruiting body is rarely seen.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/inonotus_obliquus.html |title=Inonotus obliquus (MushroomExpert.Com) |last=MushroomExpert.Com |website=mushroomexpert.com |access-date=2017-08-15}}</ref> These fruiting bodies produce [[basidiospore]]s which will spread the infection to other vulnerable trees.

== Distribution and habitat ==
''Inonotus obliquus'' is found most commonly in the [[Circumboreal Region]] of the Northern Hemisphere, where it is distributed in birch forests.<ref name="Lee 199–202" />

Generally found growing on birch (''[[Betula]]'' spp.) trees, it has also been found on alder (''[[Alnus]]'' spp.), beech (''[[Fagus]]'' spp.) and poplar (''[[Populus]]'' spp.).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ryvarden L, Gilbertson RL |title=European polypores.

It is commonly marketed as a [[dietary supplement]] for various health benefits but lacks sufficient [[scientific evidence]] for safety or effectiveness, and quality can vary due to inconsistent processing and labeling.<ref name=opss/>

Chaga is traditionally grated into a fine powder and used to brew a beverage resembling [[coffee]] or [[tea]] which tastes strongly of [[Chinese herbal tea]]. However, caution is warranted with chronic use due to the extremely high concentrations of [[oxalates]] in chaga.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Lee |first1= Sua |last2= Lee |first2= Hua Young |date= 8 May 2020 |title= Development of End Stage Renal Disease after Long-Term Ingestion of Chaga Mushroom: Case Report and Review of Literature |pmc=7234858|pmid=32419395|journal= Journal of Korean Medical Science |volume= 35 |issue=19 |pages=e122 |doi= 10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e122}}</ref>

Hot water extraction is a common preparation. A decoction is created by simmering blocklike pieces of the chaga in numerous quarts of water until the water is reduced and the remaining liquid contains a portion of the chaga's concentrated water-soluble compounds. Such preparations, produced in China and Japan, are exported worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yaoxue Xuebao {{!}} YX |url=https://www.yaoxuexuebao-05134870.com/ |access-date=2025-02-15 |website=www.yaoxuexuebao-05134870.com}}</ref> The [[Beta-glucan|β-<small>D</small>-glucans]] may have a content of approximately 35% in a pure extract.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Rhee | first1 = S.Y. | title = A comparative study of analytical methods for alkali-soluble β-glucan in medicinal mushroom, Chaga (Inonotus obliquus)| journal = LWT – Food Science and Technology| volume = 41 | issue = 3 | pages = 545–549| year = 2008 | doi=10.1016/j.lwt.2007.03.028}}</ref> If chaga tea is prepared at home, the chaga chunks can be reused multiple times.

[[Potawatomi|Potawatomi people]] use the fungus, called ''shkitagen'' in their [[Potawatomi language|language]], as a [[Firekeeper|firekeeping]] [[tinder]]. According to Potawatomi biologist [[Robin Wall Kimmerer]], "Once an ember meets ''shkitagen'' it will not go out but smolders slowly in the fungal matrix, holding its heat. Even the smallest spark, so fleeting and easily lost, will be held and nurtured if it lands on a cube of ''shkitagen''."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kimmerer |first=Robin Wall |title=Braiding sweetgrass |date=2013 |publisher=Milkweed Editions |isbn=978-1-57131-335-5 |edition=1st |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |chapter=Shkitagen: People of the Seventh Fire}}</ref>

== Common names ==
The name ''chaga'' comes from the [[Russian language|Russian]] name of the fungus, {{langx|ru|ча́га|translit=čága|label=none}}, which in turn is borrowed from the word for "mushroom" in [[Komi language|Komi]], {{langx|kv|тшак|translit=tšak|label=none}}, the language of the [[indigenous peoples]] in the [[Kama River|Kama River Basin]], west of the [[Ural Mountains]]. It is also known as the [[wikt:clinker|clinker]] [[polypore]], cinder conk, black mass and birch canker polypore.<ref name="needham">{{cite web |last=Needham |first=Arthur |date=2005-12-16 |title=Clinker Polypore, Chaga |url=http://www.sierrapotomac.org/W_Needham/ClinkerPolypore_Chaga_051216.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909150937/http://sierrapotomac.org/W_Needham/ClinkerPolypore_Chaga_051216.htm |archive-date=9 September 2011 |access-date=10 October 2011}}</ref> In [[England]] and officially in [[Canada]], it is known as the sterile conk trunk rot of [[birch]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 August 2015 |title=Sterile conk trunk rot of birch |url=https://tidcf.nrcan.gc.ca/en/diseases/factsheet/1000010 |access-date=15 August 2017 |publisher=Canadian Forest Service, Natural Resources Canada, Government of Canada |language=en}}</ref>
