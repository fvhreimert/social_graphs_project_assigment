'''''Amanita arocheae''''', also known as the '''Latin American death cap''',<ref name="urlAmanitaceae"/> is a [[mushroom]] of the large genus ''[[Amanita]]'', which occurs in Colombia, Central America and South America. Deadly [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], it is a member of [[section (botany)|section]] ''Phalloideae'' and related to the death cap, ''[[Amanita phalloides|A.&nbsp;phalloides]]''.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is convex to plano-convex, reaching dimensions of {{convert|3|–|11|cm|abbr=off|frac=4}}. The cap surface is sticky or tacky. The center of the cap is gray to brown with a gray edge. The white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are closely crowded together and free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. In young mushrooms, the gills exude drops of clear fluid. The dry, white to pale grey stipe measures {{convert|8|–|20|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} long by {{convert|0.5|–|1.7|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick. It has a bulbous base, a white to grey, membranous [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at the stipe base, and white [[mycelium]] at the base. The stipe has a white [[annulus (mycology)|ring]].<ref name="Halling 2005"/> The odor of the [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is mild to unpleasant.<ref name="urlAmanitaceae"/>

The [[spore print]] is white. [[Basidiospore|Spores]] are smooth, [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], spherical or roughly so, and measure 7–10 by 6.8–9.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent from the hyphae.<ref name="Halling 2005"/>

=== Similar species ===
''[[Amanita vaginata]]'' is similar, however ''A. vaginata'' has non-amyloid spores and lacks a ring on the stipe.

It differs from ''[[Amanita phalloides|A. phalloides]]'' (the death cap) in the colour of its cap.

== Taxonomy ==
The species was first [[species description|described]] in 1992 by mycologists Rod Tullos, C.L. Ovebro, and Roy Halling. It is closely related to ''A. phalloides'', and was referred to as this species in the past by Mexican mycologists. It is named after mycologist Regla Maria Aroche.<ref name="Tulloss 1992" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
''A. arocheae'' is found in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia. It is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species that associates with [[oak]] as a host.<ref name="Halling 2005" />
