'''''Xerocomus subtomentosus''''', commonly known as '''suede bolete''', '''brown and yellow bolete''', '''boring brown bolete''' or '''yellow-cracked bolete''', is a species of [[bolete]] fungus in the family [[Boletaceae]]. The fungus was initially described by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753 and known for many years as ''Boletus subtomentosus''.

The fungus produces [[Basidiospore|spore]]-bearing [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]]. The olive to tan fruit body cap is up to {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter and has a distinctive velvety surface. Like other boletes, it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings, or pores. The pore surface is yellow and bruises blue. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], or stem, measures up to 8&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;in) tall and {{convert|2|cm|1|abbr=on |frac=4}} thick.

It occurs throughout Eurasia, North America and Australia and grows with a wide range of [[hardwood]] and [[conifer]] trees.  It forms [[symbiotic]] [[ectomycorrhiza]]l associations with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. The species is [[edible mushroom|edible]], though not as highly regarded as other boletes.

==Taxonomy==
''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' was first described in 1753 by the father of taxonomy [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Boletus subtomentosus''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Linnaeus C | title=Species Plantarum| publisher=Laurentii Salvii |location=Stockholm | year=1753|chapter= Tomus&nbsp;II | volume=2| url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/359193#page/620/mode/1up | page=1178|language=la}}</ref> The starting date of fungal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] had been set as January&nbsp;1, 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of the 'father of mycology', Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]], which meant that the name required sanction by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid, as Linnaeus' work preceded this date. It was thus written ''Boletus subtomentosus'' L.:Fr. However, a 1987 revision of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] set the starting date at May&nbsp;1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus' seminal work, the ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.<ref name="Esser 1994"/> Hence the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.

French mycologist [[Lucien Quélet]] had classified a number of ''[[Boletus]]'' species in the genus ''Xerocomus'', with ''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' made the [[type species]]. The genus name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''Xeros'' "dry" and ''kome'' "hair", and refers to the velvety surface of the cap.<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> This classification was disputed, with many authorities not recognising the genus and continuing to use ''Boletus subtomentosus''; however genetic analysis published in 2013 confirmed the distinctness of this species and its close relatives from the core group of fungi in the genus ''Boletus'' ([[sensu stricto]]).<ref name="Nuhn 2013"/>

''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' and relatives, including ''[[Phylloporus pelletieri]]'', form a [[clade]] known informally as the "/Xerocomus Clade" within a larger group (informally called hypoboletus) in the suborder [[Boletineae]]. Other clades within the group include the ''[[Aureoboletus]]'' and ''[[Hemileccinum]]'' clades, as well as species currently designated ''Boletus'' (though they are not closely related to ''[[Boletus edulis]]'') and three species currently designated ''[[Boletellus]]'' (though they are unlikely to be close relatives of the type species, ''[[Boletellus ananas]]'').  The clade containing the hypoboletus group and the ''[[Royoungia]]'' clade is sister to the anaxoboletus group (containing the genera ''[[Tylopilus]]'' sensu stricto, ''[[Strobilomyces]]'', ''[[Xanthoconium]]'', ''[[Porphyrellus]]'', ''[[Xerocomellus]]'', ''Boletus'' sensu stricto, and species that require new generic names (e.g., ''[[Boletus badius]]'') and the leccinoid group (comprising the genera ''[[Leccinellum]]'', ''[[Leccinum]]'', ''[[Spongiforma]]'', and the species ''[[Retiboletus griseus]]'').<ref name="Nuhn 2013"/> As ''X.&nbsp;subtomentosus'' is the type species of the genus, it and close relatives remain ''Xerocomus'' as other members are placed in different genera.

===Etymology===
Its [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''subtomentosus'' is [[Latin]] "finely haired", referring to its cap.<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> Author [[David Arora]] nicknamed the mushroom the ''boring brown bolete'' from its lack of taste and appeal.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> Other vernacular names include "yellow-cracked bolete", "suede bolete",<ref name="Michell 2006"/> and "brown and yellow bolete".<ref name="Laursen 2010"/>

==Description==
The pale olive or tan [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex before flattening and measures {{convert|4 to 10|cm|1|abbr=on |frac=4}}, exceptionally up to {{convert|20|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter. It has a velvety tannish surface, occasionally with slits revealing yellow flesh beneath.'''<ref name="Arora 1986" />''' The [[pileipellis|skin]] of the cap is very hard to remove. The pores underneath the cap are yellow and may bruise blue or green'''<ref name="Arora 1986" />''' before fading somewhat. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and is up to {{convert|12|cm|1|abbr=on |frac=4}} long and {{convert|1–2|cm|1|abbr=on |frac=4}} wide.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

===Similar species===
The rare European species ''[[Xerocomus silwoodensis]]'', described as new to science in 2007, is similar in appearance to ''X.&nbsp;subtomentosus''. It can be distinguished from the latter in the field by the darker reddish-brown tones of the cap and its preference for associating with ''[[Populus]]'' trees.<ref name="Taylor 2007"/> It has white flesh that becomes yellow-tinged on exposure to air. [[Xerocomus chrysonemus|''X.&nbsp;chrysonemus'']] has bright yellow flesh and mycelium while ''X.&nbsp;ferrugineus'' is found only under conifers and also has yellow mycelium.<ref name="urlBoletales"/><!-- cites previous 3 sentences--> Also similar are ''[[Xerocomellus chrysenteron|X.&nbsp;chrystenteron]]'', ''[[Xerocomus mendocinensis|X.&nbsp;mendocinensis]]'', ''[[Xerocomus truncatus|X.&nbsp;truncatus]]'',<ref name="audu" /> ''[[Boletus chrysenteron]]'', ''B.&nbsp;citriniporus'', and ''B.&nbsp;edulis''.<ref name=":0" />

==Distribution and habitat==
''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' occurs in autumn in forests throughout Eurasia, North America and Australia and forming a [[mycorrhiza]]l relationship with a wide range of [[hardwood]] and [[conifer]] trees.<ref name="Nilper 1977"/><ref name="Arora 1986"/><ref name="Loizides 2019"/> It has been recorded from the vicinity of [[Tangier]] in Morocco, growing under cork oak (''[[Quercus suber]]'').<ref name="Maire 1937"/> It is associated with [[bilberry]] and other evergreen shrubs of the heath family [[Ericaceae]].<ref name="Michell 2006"/><ref name="Laursen 2010"/>

''Xerocomus subtomentosus''  is found in subarctic areas of western Greenland, where it is common and grows in association with white birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]'').<ref name=Elborne1990/>

==Edibility==
''Xerocomus subtomentosus'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil |url-access=registration |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil/page/254 254]}}</ref> although not highly regarded. Its mild taste makes it suitable for mixed mushroom dishes.<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> An [[elemental analysis]] of specimens collected from  western Poland determined the mushrooms to have abundant amounts of the [[electrolyte]]s [[potassium]], [[phosphorus]], and [[magnesium]],  with mean values of 46000, 8400, and 1100&nbsp;milligramme/kilogramme dry weight, respectively, in the caps. The levels of the [[toxic metal]]s [[cadmium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and [[lead]] in the mushrooms "did not pose a threat to a consumer's health".<ref name="Jarzynska 2012"/>
