'''''Mycena leaiana''''', commonly known as the '''orange mycena''' or '''Lea's mycena''', is a species of [[saprobic]] fungi in the genus ''[[Mycena]]'', family [[Mycenaceae]]. They have bright orange [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] and stalks and reddish-orange [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] edges. Typically found in North America, a [[Variety (botany)|variety]], ''M.&nbsp;leaiana'' var. ''australis'', can be found in [[Australasia]].

The mushrooms usually grow in dense clusters on [[deciduous]] logs. The [[biological pigment|pigment]] responsible for the orange color in this species has [[antibiotic]] properties.<ref name=Harttig/>

==Taxonomy==
Originally named ''Agaricus leajanus'' by the English biologist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] in 1845, [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] was later (1891) to move it to the genus ''Mycena'' when the large genus ''Agaricus'' was divided. The species was named after Thomas Gibson Lea (1785–1844), a mushroom collector from Ohio who had sent a collection of specimens to Berkeley for identification.<ref name="isbn0-919433-47-2">{{cite book |author=Schalkwijk-Barendsen, Helene M.

==Description==
The [[hygrophanous]] [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|1|to|4|cm|in}} in diameter,<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=430}}</ref> and initially rounded or bell-shaped but becoming expanded and convex with age, often with a depression in the center.<ref name="isbn1-58729-627-6"/> The color is a bright orange that fades as the mushroom matures.<ref name="audu" /> The surface of the cap is sticky, especially in moist weather, and smooth, while the margin often has striations. The [[flesh|trama]] is soft, watery, and white. The gills are adnexed in attachment (gills narrowly attached/tapering toward stem so that their attachment is almost free), crowded together, and yellowish in color, with the color deepening to bright orange-red at the edges. The deepening in color at the edges is due to an orange [[pigment]] that is contained largely within cells called [[cheilocystidia]].<ref name="urlMycena leaiana, the orange Mycena, Tom Volks Fungus of the Month for September 2005">{{cite web |url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/sep2005.html |title=''Mycena leaiana'', the orange Mycena, Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for September 2005 |access-date=2009-02-11 |archive-date=2017-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421095623/http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/sep2005.html |url-status=live }}</ref> If handled, the yellow pigment will rub off and stain the skin.<ref name="urlMycena leaiana">{{cite web |url=http://www.messiah.edu/Oakes/fungi_on_wood/gilled%20fungi/species%20pages/Mycena%20leaiana.htm |title=Mycena leaiana |access-date=2009-02-11 |archive-date=2008-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327215538/http://www.messiah.edu/Oakes/fungi_on_wood/gilled%20fungi/species%20pages/Mycena%20leaiana.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

However, ''M.&nbsp;leaiana'' had been found primarily in the east of the United States (and specifically not on the Pacific coast at all) upon the discovery of specimens in Australia. Given this wide geographical separation (as well as the difference in cap color) a new varietal name was proposed.<ref name="New or Interesting Queensland Agaricales"/>

=== Similar species ===
''Mycena texensis'' [[Alexander H. Smith|A.H. Sm.]] (1937) is closely related, but has been described as having "grayish colors of the cap".<ref name="Smith1937">Smith AH. (1937). "Studies in the genus ''Mycena''. IV". ''Mycologia'' '''29'''(3): 338–354.</ref> It is better distinguished microscopically: it has smaller spores, shorter and narrower [[basidia]], and distinctive [[cystidia]].<ref name="Smith1937" />

== Habitat and distribution ==
''Mycena leaiana'' is a common species, and grows in dense cespitose clusters (with stipes sharing a single point of origin) on hardwood logs and branches. It is a North American species, and has been reported throughout the eastern and central U.S. and Canada.<ref name="urlUniversity of Michigan Herbarium Fungus Monographs: North American species of Mycena.">{{cite web |url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=fung1tc;cc=fung1tc;sid=9f2f323a0b58d530cb9ed85450736e8d;rgn=full%20text;idno=AGK0806.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000430 |title=University of Michigan Herbarium Fungus Monographs: North American species of Mycena. |access-date=2009-02-10 |archive-date=2011-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522173932/http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=fung1tc;cc=fung1tc;sid=9f2f323a0b58d530cb9ed85450736e8d;rgn=full%20text;idno=AGK0806.0001.001;view=image;seq=00000430 |url-status=live }}</ref> The variant ''Mycena leaiana'' var.

==Bioactive compounds==
''Mycena leaiana'' produces the orange [[pigment]] leainafulvene, a member of the class of chemical compounds known as ''isoilludanes''. Leainafulvene has weak [[antibacterial]] activity against ''[[Acinetobacter calcoaceticus]]'', and has pronounced [[cytotoxic]] activity towards [[tumor]] cells.  It also has [[mutagenic]] activity, as measured by the [[Ames test]].<ref name=Harttig/>
