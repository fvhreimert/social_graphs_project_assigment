'''''Russula mustelina''''', commonly known as the '''russet brittlegill''', is a [[basidiomycete]] [[mushroom]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Russula]]'' native to Europe and North America. Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] described the species in his 1838 book ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum''.<ref name="Fries 1838">{{cite book |last=Fries |first=E.

== Description ==


The fruit bodies appear in autumn and can be partly submerged in the soil. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|7|–|12|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide, occasionally reaching {{convert|16|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}, with a shape ranging from convex (in young specimens) to flattened, sometimes with a shallow central depression. The cap surface is dry and can be slightly sticky when wet. The colour is pale yellow to yellow-brown with wine-coloured cap margin and can be discoloured with wine-coloured splotches with age. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is {{convert|3|–|10|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick under the cap and has a mild taste. The cream [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] ranging from [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] to [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]]. Fruit bodies have almost no odour. The hard white stem measures {{convert|4|–|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2|–|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and is roughly the same width throughout its length, although it can be a little thicker near the base. Its surface is dry and smooth.<ref name="Desjardin 2014"/><!-- cites para -->

''Russula mustelina'' produces a yellowish [[spore print]]. The roundish [[spores]] have dimensions of 7.5–10.5 by 6.5–9&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], with a reticulate (web-like) and ridged surface marked by occasional warts.<ref name="Desjardin 2014"/> 

''[[Russula basifurcata]]'' is a similar species with smaller fruit bodies associated with oak trees at lower altitudes. The gills are forked near the stem.<ref name="Desjardin 2014"/>

== Ecology ==
''Russula mustelina'' occurs in coniferous forests above {{cvt|1600|m}} in the [[Sierra Nevada]] and [[Cascade Range]] in western North America.<ref name="Desjardin 2014"/> It is a component of rare [[peat bog]] habitat in the eastern Carpathians in Romania, where it is associated with European spruce (''[[Picea abies]]'').<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chinan |first1=Vasilică-Claudiu | last2=Mânzu | first2=Ciprian |title=MACROFUNGAL DIVERSITY OF A PEAT BOG FROM DORNA DEPRESSION (EASTERN CARPATHIANS, ROMANIA) |date=2014 |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=43–52  | journal=  Analele Stiint.
