'''''Coprinopsis atramentaria''''', commonly known as the '''alcohol inky cap''''',''<ref>{{Cite book |last=Siegel |first=Noah |title=Mushrooms of Cascadia: A Comprehensive Guide to Fungi of the Pacific Northwest |last2=Schwartz |first2=Christian |date=September 1, 2024 |publisher=Backcountry Press |isbn=9781941624197 |location=Humboldt County, California |publication-date= |pages=91}}</ref> '''common ink cap''', '''tippler's bane''', or '''inky cap''', is a species of [[fungus]]. It is the second best-known [[ink cap]] after ''[[Coprinus comatus]]'', its former [[genus|congener]]. The grey-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild.

It is a widespread and common throughout the Northern Hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and [[disturbed habitat]]s such as [[vacant lot]]s and lawns, as well as grassy areas.  It can be eaten, but due to the presence of [[coprine]] within the mushroom, it is [[poison]]ous when consumed with [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]], as it heightens the body's sensitivity to [[ethanol]] in a similar manner to the anti-alcoholism drug [[disulfiram]].

== Taxonomy ==
The common ink cap was first described by French naturalist [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] in 1786 as ''Agaricus atramentarius'' before being placed in the large genus ''[[Coprinus]]'' in 1838 by [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''atramentum'' "ink".<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=72}}</ref>

The genus was formerly considered to be a large one with well over 100 species. However, [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular analysis]] of DNA sequences showed that most species belonged in the family [[Psathyrellaceae]], distinct from the [[type species]] that belonged to the [[Agaricaceae]]. It was given its current binomial name in 2001 as a result, as this and other species were moved to the new genus ''[[Coprinopsis]]''.<ref name="Red01">{{cite journal|year=2001|title=''Coprinus'' Pers. and the disposition of ''Coprinus'' species ''sensu lato''.|journal=Taxon|volume=50|issue=1|pages=203–41|doi=10.2307/1224525|jstor=1224525|author1=Redhead, Scott A|author2=Vilgalys, Rytas|author3=Moncalvo, Jean-Marc|author4=Johnson, Jacqui|author5=Hopple Jr. John S|publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy (IAPT) |bibcode=2001Taxon..50..203R }}</ref>

The term "tippler's bane" is derived from its ability to create acute sensitivity to alcohol, similar to [[disulfiram]] (Antabuse).<ref name="arora86">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/347/mode/2up |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |year=1986 |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=347–48}}</ref> Other common names include common ink cap and inky cap.

Like many ink caps, it grows in tufts. It is commonly associated with buried wood and is found in grassland, meadows, [[disturbed ground]], and open terrain from late spring to autumn. Fruiting bodies have been known to push their way up through [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]]<ref name=Fuh05/> and even tennis courts.{{sfn|Ramsbottom|1953|p=128}} It is also common in urban areas and appears in vacant lots, and tufts of fungi can be quite large and fruit several times a year. If dug up, the [[mycelium]] can often be found originating on buried dead wood.{{sfn|Ramsbottom|1953|p=196}}

==Toxicity and uses==

, [[Kolkata]]]]

The mushrooms are considered edible when young, but consuming them within a few hours of alcohol results in [[Disulfiram-alcohol reaction|disulfiram-like symptoms]].{{sfn|Benjamin|1995|p=284}}<ref name=michelot1992>{{cite journal |last1=Michelot |first1=Didier |title=Poisoning by ''Coprinus atramentarius'' |journal=Natural Toxins |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=73–80 |year=1992 |pmid=1344910 |doi=10.1002/nt.2620010203 }}</ref> This interaction has only been known since the early part of the 20th century. Symptoms include facial reddening, nausea, vomiting, [[malaise]], agitation, [[palpitations]], and tingling in limbs, arising five to ten minutes after consumption of alcohol.{{sfn|Benjamin|1995|p=288}} If no more alcohol is consumed, they will generally subside over two or three hours. Symptom severity is proportional to the amount of alcohol consumed, becoming evident when blood alcohol concentration reaches 5&nbsp;mg/dl, and prominent at concentrations of 50–100&nbsp;mg/dl. Disulfiram has, however, been known to cause [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack).<ref>{{EMedicine|article|817759|Disulfiramlike Mushroom Toxicity}}</ref> The symptoms can occur if even a small amount of alcohol is consumed up to three days after eating the mushrooms, although they are milder as more time passes.{{sfn|Benjamin|1995|p=289}} Rarely, a [[cardiac arrhythmia]], such as [[atrial fibrillation]] on top of [[supraventricular tachycardia]], may develop.{{sfn|Benjamin|1995|p=289}} Because of these effects, in some cases, the mushroom has been used to cure [[alcoholism]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=235}}</ref>

The fungus contains a cyclopropylglutamine compound called [[coprine]].{{sfn|Benjamin|1995|p=286}} Its active metabolite, {{nowrap|1-aminocyclopropanol}}, blocks the action of an enzyme, [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], which breaks down [[acetaldehyde]] in the body.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Marchner |first1=H. |last2=Tottmar |first2=O. |title=A Comparative Study on the Effects of Disulfiram, Cyanamide and 1-Aminocyclopropanol on the Acetaldehyde Metabolism in Rats |journal=Acta Pharmacologica et Toxicologica |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=219–32 |year=1978 |pmid=707135 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0773.1978.tb02258.x }}</ref> Acetaldehyde is an intermediate [[metabolite]] of [[ethanol]] and is responsible for most symptoms of a [[hangover]]; its effect on autonomic [[Adrenergic receptor#.CE.B2 receptors|β receptors]] is responsible for the [[vasomotor]] symptoms.{{sfn|Benjamin|1995|p=286}}

Treatment involves reassuring the patient that the often frightening symptoms will pass, rehydration (fluid replacement) for fluid loss from vomiting, and monitoring for [[cardiac arrhythmia]]s.{{sfn|Benjamin|1995|p=290}}

Large and prolonged doses of coprine were found to have [[gonadotoxic effects]] on rats and dogs in testing.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jönsson |first1=Monica |last2=Lindquist |first2=Nils Gunnar |last3=Plöen |first3=Leif |last4=Ekvärn |first4=Sven |last5=Kronevi |first5=Tony |title=Testicular lesions of coprine and benzcoprine |journal=Toxicology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=89–100 |year=1979 |pmid=473235 |doi=10.1016/0300-483X(79)90035-0 |bibcode=1979Toxgy..12...89J }}</ref>
