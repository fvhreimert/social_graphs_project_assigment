'''''Russula cyanoxantha''''', commonly known as the '''charcoal burner''' or '''variegated russula''',<ref name=Arora1986>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/94/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=94–95 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> is a [[basidiomycete]] mushroom. It can be confused for a number of other members of its genus. Found mostly in Europe (with North American counterparts), it is an [[edible mushroom]].

==Description==
The most salient characteristic is the weak gills, which feel greasy to the touch, are flexible and do not break. The cap is {{Convert|4-18|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, convex at first and later flattened, and greenish to bright brown; they vary considerably in color.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The spores are white,<ref name=":0" /> as is the [[spore print]].<ref name="audu" /> The stipe does not produce a salmon reaction when rubbed with [[ferrous sulphate]].<ref name=Arora1986/>

=== Similar species ===

The cap of the grey-green ''[[Russula grisea]]'' is more blue-grey but has violet or green hues with light cream gills; it also grows in mixed forests, particularly under beech, and more rarely in [[conifer]]ous forests. ''[[Russula olivacea]]'' also may have a variegated cap, but produces yellow spores.<ref name=":0" /> ''[[Russula aeruginea|R.&nbsp;aeruginea]]'' is greenish and has forked gills. ''[[Russula variata|R.&nbsp;variata]]'' is frequently forked and found in the east. ''[[Russula versicolor|R.&nbsp;versicolor]]'' has yellowish, unforked gills.<ref name="audu" />

==Habitat and distribution==
''Russula cyanoxantha'' grows in slightly [[Soil pH|acidic]], but nutrient-rich soil. Like all ''Russulas'', it is a [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus. It is found most commonly in [[beech]] forests, and often in deciduous or mixed forests.

It is possible that only European specimens are actually ''R.&nbsp;cyanoxantha''.<ref name="audu" /> It has been described as appearing from July to October in eastern North America and the [[Mountain states]], and from October to January further west.<ref name="audu" />

==Uses==
The [[edible mushroom]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |orig-year=2005 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=137}}</ref> is suitable for many kinds of preparation; the flesh is not as hard as that of many other edible Russulas. It has a mild,<ref name=":0" /> nutty taste, but is also appreciated by maggots.<ref name="Arora1986" />

== In culture ==
It was designated "Mushroom of the Year" in 1997 by the German Association of Mycology.
