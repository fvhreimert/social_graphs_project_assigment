'''''Lactarius pyrogalus''''', commonly known as the  '''fire-milk lactarius''', is a species of inedible [[mushroom]] in genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]''. It is greyish and differentiated from other grey ''Lactarius'' by its widely spaced, yellow gills. It is found on the forest floor in mixed woodland, especially at the base of [[hazel]] trees.

==Taxonomy==
''Lactarius pyrogalus'' was first described by French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] as ''Agaricus pyrogalus'' in 1792, before being given its current binomial name by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838.

==Description==
''Lactarius pyrogalus'' has a cap {{convert|5|-|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} across which is grey fawn, sometimes with a yellowish tinge,<ref name="Phillips">

===Spores===
''Lactarius pyrogalus'' produces a light ochre [[spore print]]; the spores are broadly elliptic, with warts generally joined by a moderately thick ridges in a well-developed network.<ref name="Phillips"/> The spores are 7&ndash;8 by 5.5&ndash;7&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] in size.<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Pegler"/> The spores are [[amyloid]], meaning they stain dark blue in [[Melzer's reagent]], and feature an incomplete net.<ref name="Pegler"/>

==Distribution==
''Lactarius pyrogalus'' is fairly common<ref name="Pegler"/> and is generally found at the base of [[hazel]] trees alone or in scattered groups.<ref>{{cite book|title= The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ULhwByKCyEwC&q=Lactarius+pyrogalus&pg=PA306|access-date= 2008-07-31|last= Jordan|first= Michael|year= 2004|publisher= [[Frances Lincoln]]|location= London|isbn= 978-0-7112-2378-3|page= 306}}{{Dead link|date=June 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It is particularly common in hazel woodland managed for [[coppice]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Complete British Wildlife|last= Sterry|first= Paul|year= 1997|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|isbn= 978-0-583-33638-3|page= 352}}</ref> It can also be found elsewhere on the ground in mixed woodland.<ref name="Pegler"/> It is found in the autumn months of August, September and October.<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Pegler"/>

==Edibility==
''Lactarius pyrogalus'' has a very hot, acrid taste and is acidic.<ref name="Phillips"/> It is due to this taste that it received both its English name, fire-milk lactarius, and its scientific name, with "pyrogalus" translating as "fire milk".<ref name="Roody"/> Despite not being poisonous,<ref name="Pegler"/> it is not regarded as edible and should be avoided.<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Pegler"/> This is unlike its relative, the saffron milk-cap (''[[Lactarius deliciosus|L. deliciosus]]''), which is regarded as a choice mushroom.<ref>Phillips, 80.</ref>
