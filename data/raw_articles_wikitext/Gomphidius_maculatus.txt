'''''Gomphidius maculatus''''', commonly known as the '''larch slime spike''',<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Siegel |first=Noah |title=Mushrooms of Cascadia: A Comprehensive Guide to Fungi of the Pacific Northwest |last2=Schwarz |first2=Christian |date=September 1, 2024 |publisher=Backcountry Press |isbn=9781941624197 |location=Humboldt County, CA |pages=122}}</ref> is a species of mushroom in the family [[Gomphidiaceae]].<ref name="Miller 2006"/> It is widely distributed in Europe and North America, where it forms [[mycorrhiza]]l associations with [[larch]] trees. It is an [[introduced species]] in New Zealand. While not known to be poisonous, it is slimy and could potentially accumulate heavy metals.<ref name=":0" />

==Taxonomy==

It was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by naturalist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] in 1772. [[Elias Magnus Fries]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Gomphidius]]'' in 1838, giving it the name by which it is known today. The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''maculatus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word for "spotted".<ref name="Pacioni 1981"/> The [[type (biology)#type locality|type locality]] was [[Carniola]], a historical region that now comprises parts of present-day Slovenia.<ref name="Mcnabb 1970"/>

==Description==

The cap ([[pileus (mycology)|cap]]) of ''Gomphidius maculatus'' measures 2–9&nbsp;cm in diameter and is initially convex, becoming plano-convex or flattened with maturity. Sometimes it may develop a slight [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] (central raised area). The cap surface is glutinous (sticky and slimy) in damp conditions and glabrous (smooth). Its colouration ranges from pinkish fawn to pale reddish-brown, often with light orange in the centre, fading to pallid pinkish fawn or dingy white towards the margins. A distinctive characteristic of this species is its tendency to readily stain black when damaged. The cap margins are strongly inrolled when young, becoming moderately inrolled at maturity.<ref name="Mcnabb 1970"/>

The gills ([[lamellae (mycology)|lamellae]] are somewhat distant to distantly spaced, [[decurrent]] (running down the stipe), thick with bluntly rounded edges. They often branch dichotomously and may have transverse veins or wrinkles towards the margins. The gills are 2–8&nbsp;mm deep, initially white, becoming dingy white and finally sooty grey at maturity.<ref name="Mcnabb 1970"/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 3.5–10&nbsp;cm long, tapering towards the base, measuring 7–11&nbsp;mm in diameter at the apex and 4–7&nbsp;mm at the base. It is central, solid or slightly stuffed, with longitudinal fibrils. The stem is white to dingy white, with a distinctive bright yellow colouration at the base, and readily blackens when handled. Numerous small glandular dots are present on the stem, initially reddish-brown but blackening with age. The flesh is white to brownish-white in the upper portion, slowly turning reddish when exposed to air, and yellow towards the base. The basal [[mycelium]] is yellow.<ref name="Mcnabb 1970"/>

The [[spore print]] is dark grey, appearing black when deposited thickly. The spores are dark melleous (honey-coloured) to dark brown, subfusiform (somewhat spindle-shaped) with a slight depression or flattening in the suprahilar region (above the [[hilum (botany)|hilum]]), and measure 17.5–23.5 by 6.5–8&nbsp;μm. They have slightly thickened walls, are smooth, and lack a [[germ pore]].<ref name="Mcnabb 1970"/>

When treated with chemical reagents, the [[trama (mycology)|context]] (flesh) of the fungus turns dull greyish-green with [[ferrous sulphate]] (FeSO<sub>4</sub>) and rose pink darkening to brick red with ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH). The fungus has a mild taste.<ref name="Mcnabb 1970"/>

''Gomphidius maculatus'' has a wide distribution in the northern hemisphere, where it forms [[mycorrhiza]]l associations with [[larch]] trees. It has also been [[introduced species|introduced]] to new Zealand.<ref name="Mcnabb 1970"/>
