'''''Amanita regalis''''', commonly known as the '''royal fly agaric''' or the '''king of Sweden Amanita''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Amanitaceae]]. ''A.&nbsp;regalis'' has a scabby liver-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and a [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] which is yellow-[[ochre]] at the base, with patches or rings of patches. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] somewhat resemble the smaller ''[[Amanita muscaria|A.&nbsp;muscaria]]'' (fly agaric), which it was formerly regarded as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of.

''A. regalis'' is common in [[Scandinavia]] and also found in eastern and northern Europe. Its North American distribution is restricted to [[Alaska]]. Like ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'', it is [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] and contains the [[Psychoactive mushroom|psychoactive]] compound [[muscimol]].

==Taxonomy==
''A.&nbsp;regalis'' was first described as ''Agaricus muscarius'' β ''regalis'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in his ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'', published in 1821.<ref name="Fries1821" /> In 1887, [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] treated it as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Amanita muscaria|A.&nbsp;muscaria]]''.<ref name="Saccardo1887" /> [[Edmund Michael]], in 1903, became the first to consider it a distinct species.<ref name="Michael1903" /> In 1941, [[Jean-Edouard Gilbert]] suggested a complete reorganization of the genus ''[[Amanita]]'' in his world [[monograph]] of the genus, and moved it to ''Amanitaria'' as ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' var. ''regalis''.<ref name="Gilbert1941" /> In his original (1949) version of ''Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', [[Rolf Singer]] considered it a [[subspecies]] of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'', but noted that it may be regarded as a separate species; in the fourth edition (1986), he listed it as a distinct species.<ref name="Singer1986" /> ''A.&nbsp;regalis'' is classified in a section of ''Amanita'' within the genus, a grouping of related Amanitas that have a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] (or remnants thereof), and a bulb at the base of it.<ref name="Jenkinsp16">Jenkins (1986), p. 16.</ref> More recently, a Japanese group studied the [[biogeography]] of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' and related species, and, using [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis, concluded that the taxon should be considered a grouping of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'', rather than a distinct species.<ref name="Oda2004" /> However, as of 2012, both [[Index Fungorum]] and [[MycoBank]] list the taxon as ''Amanita regalis''.<ref name="urlFungorum synonymy: Amanita regalis" /><ref name="MycoBank" />

The species has been called by several [[common name|vernacular]] names, including the "Brown fly agaric",<ref name="Stijve2000" /> the "king of Sweden Amanita",<ref name="Tulloss2009" /> or the king fly agaric.<ref name="Fungi of Latvia" /> In France it is known as ''Amanite royale'',<ref name="Danel1999" /> while in Germany it is ''Königsfliegenpilz''.<ref name="Ternes2005" /> The specific epithet is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''regalis'', meaning "royal".<ref name="Manser1999" /> In 2000, it was selected by the German Mycological Society as "Mushroom of the Year".<ref name="Stijve2000" />

==Description==
[[image:Amanita regalis 52330.jpg|left|thumb|This young specimen shows the characteristic color, cap warts, and stem that are typical of this species. An immature fruit body can be seen to the right.]]
Like all ''[[Amanita]]'' species, the bulk of the organism lies beneath the ground as a symbiotic partner to certain species of trees. The [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]] of the fungus is a reproductive structure that appears when appropriate environmental conditions of moisture, temperature, and nutrient availability are met. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''A.&nbsp;regalis'' is {{convert|10|to|25|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} broad, and, depending on the stage of its development, can range in shape from spherical to convex to somewhat flattened. The color is yellowish brown, and it is densely covered with yellowish to light [[ochre|ochraceous]] scabby warts, which are arranged in almost regular concentric rings.<ref name=Pilat1961/> The rings are a remnant of the [[volva (mycology)|volva]] left behind during expansion of the young fruit body. The cap is fleshy and when mature has grooves on the margin, which can extend {{convert|1.5|to|2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] may be separated from the cap by peeling, to almost the center.

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded close together, free from attachment to the stem, and white with a creamy yellow tinge. The edges of the gills are floccose, meaning they have tufts of soft wooly hairs—another volval remnant. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] of a mature individual is typically between {{convert|10|and|20|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} long and {{convert|1.5|to|2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide,<ref name=Bresinsky1989/>  and spreads at the base into a bulb ornamented with 2–4 rings of small [[wikt:squamulose|squamulose]], lemon or ochre-yellow warts. The entire stem and ring are not pure white but have a faint yellowish tinge. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, faintly yellowish in the stem, and golden yellow under the cuticle of the cap. It does not change color in air, and has an insignificant taste and smell.<ref name=Pilat1961/>

===Microscopic features===
The spores are broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical, [[hyaline]] (translucent), smooth, and have dimensions of 9–12 by 7–8&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. They are non-amyloid, meaning that they do not absorb iodine when stained with [[Melzer's reagent]].<ref name=Pilat1961/> The spore-producing cells, the [[basidia]], are club-shaped, measure 38–46 by 3–13&nbsp;μm, and have clamps at their bases.<ref name=Jenkinsp38>Jenkins (1986), p. 38.</ref>

===Similar species===
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=Amanita pantherina.JPG|image2=Perlpilz.jpg|width=140|caption2=''Amanita pantherina'' (top) and ''Amanita rubescens'' (bottom) are lookalike species.}}
''Amanita regalis'' is easily distinguished from ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' by the absence of any red color in the cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, ''Amanita regalis'' may be confused with the [[blusher]] (''A.&nbsp;rubescens'', edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: ''A.&nbsp;regalis'' is yellowish while ''A.&nbsp;rubescens'' is white. ''[[Amanita pantherina|A.&nbsp;pantherina]]'' has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.<ref name=Bresinsky1989/> In the past there was some confusion with another species, now called ''[[Amanita pseudoregalis]]'', which is like a decoloured form of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria''.

==Distribution and habitat==
''A. regalis'' is more common in northern than south Europe, and it has not been reported from south and west Europe.<ref name="Pilat1961" /> In addition to being common in [[Scandinavia]]n countries,<ref name="Bresinsky1989" /> it has been collected in [[Germany]],<ref name="Dorfelt2003" /> [[Hungary]],<ref name="Vasas1991" /> [[Latvia]],<ref name="Fungi of Latvia" /> Russia,<ref name="Kirillova2006" /> [[Slovakia]],<ref name="Lizon1989" /> and [[Korea]].<ref name="Park1992" /> In North America, its distribution is restricted to [[Alaska]],<ref name="Jenkinsp38" /> where it is usually found above the [[tree line]].<ref name="Tulloss2009" />

It is a rare species typically found growing on the ground in [[montane|mountainous]] forests, both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous forest|coniferous]].<ref name="Oda2004" /> It is a [[mycorrhizae|mycorrhizal]] fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the [[mycelium]], envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed [[dietary mineral|minerals]], [[trace element]]s and water from the soil, while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through [[photosynthesis]]. ''A.&nbsp;regalis'' has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with [[birch]], [[Scots pine]], [[Mountain pine]], and [[Norway spruce]].<ref name="Maijala1991" /><ref name="Modess1939" /> Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in [[fairy ring]]s.<ref name="Dietrich2010" />

''Amanita regalis'' is [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]]. A case of [[mushroom poisoning|poisoning]] was reported from [[Finland]], where three individuals believed they had consumed the [[edible mushroom|edible]] parasol mushroom ''[[Macrolepiota procera]]''. The symptoms of poisoning, which began 1–2&nbsp;hours after ingestion of the mushrooms, were gastrointestinal—nausea and heavy vomiting. Two had [[central nervous system]] manifestations and [[cholinergic]] symptoms, including [[hallucination]]s, [[mental confusion|confusion]], or loss of consciousness as well as profuse salivation and sweating. All three individuals recovered within 4–24&nbsp;hours without any damage to [[liver]], [[kidney]]s or the central nervous system. As this incident demonstrates, cooking the mushrooms does not completely neutralize the toxic components of ''A.&nbsp;regalis''.<ref name="Elonen1979" /> [[Analytical chemistry|Chemical analysis]] has shown that this species contains [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]],<ref name="Bresinsky1989" /> the same toxic constituents as ''A.&nbsp;muscaria''.<ref name="Brvar2006" />

''Amanita regalis'' has the ability to [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] the [[vanadium]], a phenomenon first reported in ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' in 1931.<ref name="TerMeulen1931" /> A field study of Scandinavian specimens found vanadium contents ranging from 38 to 169&nbsp;mg of vanadium per kg of dry mushroom (average of 119&nbsp;mg/kg).<ref name="Meisch1979" /> For comparison, the vanadium concentration in most other mushrooms is typically less than 2&nbsp;mg/kg.<ref name="Sigel1995" />
