'''''Roridomyces austrororidus''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''austro dripping bonnet''', is a species of [[agaric]] [[fungus]] in the family [[Mycenaceae]]. Described as new to science in 1962 by American mycologist [[Rolf Singer]], it is found in South America, New Zealand, and Australia, where it grows on rotting wood.

The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) have several distinguishing characteristics that facilitate identification, including thick, white, [[Mucilage|mucilaginous]] stipes, and white to pale cream, convex [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that measure {{convert|1|–|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white, widely spaced, and have a fused or [[decurrent]] attachment to the stipe. [[Spore]]s are smooth, [[ellipsoid]], and measure about 9–15 by 6–9 [[micrometre]]s. The smooth and white stipes are {{convert|4|–|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|0.1|–|0.2|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and covered with a thick coating of [[gluten]].

==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==
The species was first [[species description|described]] as ''Mycena austrororida'' by mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] in 1962, based on specimens he collected from [[Masatierra]], in the [[Juan Fernandez Islands]], Chile.<ref name="Singer 1962"/> Karl-Heinz Rexer transferred it to the newly [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] genus ''[[Roridomyces]]'' in his 1994 [[doctoral thesis]].<ref name="Rexer 1994"/> The name ''Mycena veronicae'', published by New Zealand mycologist [[Greta Stevenson]] in 1964,<ref name="Stevenson 1964"/> is a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''M.&nbsp;austrororida''.<ref name="Horak 1978"/>

The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "austro dripping bonnet".<ref name="Young 2004"/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] combines the [[Latin words]] ''austro'' (from ''australis'', "south")<ref name="Brookes 2004"/> and ''roridus'' ("wet with dew").<ref name="Quattrocchi 1999"/>

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is shallowly convex to convex or irregularly convex, and with or without a shallow [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], measuring up to {{convert|16|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and up to {{convert|5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} high. The cap margin is curved downward, sometimes slightly flared, and sometimes has translucent radial striations marking the positions of the gills underneath. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]]—thickest at the center of the cap—tapers gradually to the margin. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are broadly [[adnation|adnate]] (fused) to [[decurrent]] (running down the length of the stipe). The gill edges are either smooth and even, or may have minute teeth. The gills are well-spaced, with 16 to 24 gills extending fully from the cap margin to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and two or three tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stipe). The smooth, cylindrical stipe is up to {{convert|27|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, and up to {{convert|2.5|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter at the base, narrowing towards the top. It is hollow, silky to shiny, and mucilaginous—usually with thick slime at the base. Sometimes, there are short white hairs at the bottom of the stipe, although their presence is variable. The mushroom has no distinctive odor.<ref name="Grgurinovic 1995"/>

[[Spore]]s are roughly [[ellipsoid]]al in shape with a Q ratio (the fraction of length/width) of 1.6, and dimensions of 9.4–15.4 by 6.2–9.0&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. They have a small, oblique [[wikt:apiculus|apiculus]], lack oil droplets, and are smooth with thin walls, and [[hyaline]] (translucent). The spores are acyanophilous and strongly [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning they [[staining|stain]] with [[Methyl blue]] and [[Melzer's reagent]], respectively. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored (rarely two-spored) and club-shaped with long, robust [[sterigmata]] up to 6.0&nbsp;μm long; they have [[clamp connection]]s at their bases, and measure 35.3–49.6 by 10.3–14.4&nbsp;μm. ''Roridomyces austrororidus'' has two types of cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on gill edges). One is rare, broadly club-shaped, and tapers to a narrow stem; it measures 24.1–39.5 by 6.8–12.7&nbsp;μm. The other cheilocystidia are moderately dense to abundant, and form a sterile gill edge. They are cylindrical, measuring 27.5–70.4 by 5.4–10.4&nbsp;μm, and often have a swollen tip that splits into two, rarely three branches.<ref name="Grgurinovic 1995"/>

===Similar species===
The African species ''[[Roridomyces mauritianus]]'' is similar in appearance to ''R.&nbsp;austrororidus'', but can be distinguished by the brownish cap, and microscopically by its smaller spores (measuring 7–8 by 3.5–4.0&nbsp;μm), and its shorter (25–40&nbsp;μm), club-shaped basidia.<ref name="Robich 2001"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
[[image:Roridomyces austrororidus 42901.jpg|thumb|right|Fruit bodies grow on decaying wood.]]
Like all members of its genus, ''Roridomyces austrororidus'' grows as a [[saprophytic|saprophyte]] on rotting wood. In Australia, the fungus fruits in clusters or groups on rainforest trees, decayed logs, fallen ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' branches, ''[[Bedfordia salicina]]'' logs and branches, and ''[[Nothofagus cunninghamii]]''  logs. Fruiting usually occurs after rainy periods from April to June, although the mushroom has also been collected in August.<ref name="Grgurinovic 1995"/> New Zealand collections have been reported to grow on ''[[Pinus]]'', ''[[Leptospermum]]'', and ''[[Ripogonum]]''.<ref name="Horak 1978"/> A study of fungal [[ecological succession|succession]] in a wet eucalypt forest in [[Tasmania]] demonstrated that ''R.&nbsp;austrororidus'' prefers mature forests (with at least 70 years of growth since the last [[Bushfires in Australia|wildfire]]), and fruits on small diameter wood—typically twigs with a width less than {{convert|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Gates 2005"/>

''Roridomyces austrororidus'' occurs in Argentina,<ref name="Niveiro 2013"/> Chile, New Zealand,<ref name="Horak 1978"/> and Australia.<ref name="Grgurinovic 1995"/> Its Australian distribution includes [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], Tasmania and [[Western Australia]]. Australian mycologist [[Anthony M. Young|Tony Young]] suggests that the geographical distribution of the fungus indicates that its ancestor may have originated from the ancient continent [[Gondwana]].<ref name="Young 2004"/>
