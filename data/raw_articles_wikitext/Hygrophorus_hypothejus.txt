It appears in late autumn in [[conifer]]ous forests, often with the first frosts.

==Taxonomy==
[[Elias Magnus Fries]] described this species in 1821 as ''Agaricus hypothejus'', before placing it in the genus ''Hygrophorus'' in 1838. Its species name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''hypo'' and ''theios'' "sulphur yellow underneath".<ref name="Nilper"/> It has the common name of herald of the winter as it appears in autumn with the onset of the first overnight frosts.<ref name="Nilper"/> Alternate names are late fall waxy cap in the United States,<ref name="Roody "/> and yellow-gilled waxcap.<ref name="Lamaison 2005"/>

==Description==
The cap measures {{convert|3-6|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} across, is yellowish to olive brown with a dark center and slimy surface,<ref name="Nilper"/><ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=69, 71}}</ref> and has a rolled margin when young, flattening and becoming more funnel-shaped as it ages.<ref name="Haas 1969"/> The yellow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are decurrent, and the flesh is pale yellow, turning orange-red when bruised. The slender stipe is {{convert|4-7|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} tall and {{convert|0.7-1.4|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide.<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> The colour can become more intense with the onset of frosts.<ref name="Roody "/> The [[spore print]] is white and the oval spores measure 7–9 x 4–5 [[micrometre]]s.<ref name="Phillips 2006"/>

===Similar species===
A number of species in the genus are similar,<ref name=Arora1986/> including ''[[Hygrophorus speciosus|H.&nbsp;speciosus]]''.<ref name=":0" />
It could also be confused with ''[[Gomphidius glutinosus]]'' (the slimy spike cap), the gills of which separate easily from the cap.<ref name="Lamaison 2005" /> 

==Distribution and habitat==
The mushroom grows in [[conifer]]ous forests, appearing in October and November,<ref name="Nilper"/> occasionally December. Though mushrooms may be abundant, they are often hard to spot among the pine needles.<ref name="Haas 1969"/> They often appear in big groups of individuals and clusters.<ref name=":0" />

==Edibility==
It is edible but of variable quality, as some specimens may be slimy.<ref name="Nilper"/><ref name="Haas 1969"/><ref name="Phillips 2006"/>
