'''''Lactarius vietus''''' (commonly known as the '''grey milkcap''') is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Russulaceae]], [[species description|first described]] by [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. It produces moderately sized and brittle [[mushroom]]s, which grow on the [[forest floor]] or on rotting wood. The flattened-convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] can vary in shape, sometimes forming the shape of a wide funnel. It is typically grey, but the colour varies. The species has crowded, light-coloured [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], which produce white [[latex|milk]]. The [[spore print]] is typically whitish, but also varies considerably. The mushrooms typically have a strong, acrid taste and have been described as inedible, but other authors have described them as consumable after boiling. ''L.&nbsp;vietus'' feeds by forming an [[ectomycorrhizal]] relationship with surrounding trees, and it favours [[birch]]. It grows in autumn months and is fairly common in Europe, North America and eastern Asia.

==Taxonomy==

==Description==

''Lactarius vietus'' typically has a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of {{convert|2.5|to|7.5|cm|in|sigfig=1}} across, with a flattened-convex shape.<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Sterry">{{cite book |title= Complete Guide to British Mushrooms & Toadstools|author1=Sterry, Paul |author2=Hughes, Barry |year= 2009|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|isbn= 978-0-00-723224-6|page= 52}}</ref> At times, the cap becomes widely funnel-shaped, and sometimes features a broad or pointed [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]],<ref name="Phillips"/> though the centre of the cap is typically depressed.<ref name="Sterry"/> The cap is coloured grey, sometimes with violet, flesh-coloured, pale yellowish-brown<ref name="Phillips"/> or red tints,<ref name="Smith"/> though it is paler towards the cap margin in young mushrooms.<ref name="Sterry"/> Very pale specimens have also been recorded in the United States, though they are not true [[albinos]].<ref name="Smith"/> The cap's margin is curved inwards in younger specimens,<ref name="Phillips"/> and wavey. The cap surface is smooth,<ref name="Sterry"/> and can be slimey or sticky when wet. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures {{convert|2.5|to|8|cm|in|sigfig=1}} by {{convert|2|to|7|cm|in|sigfig=1}}, and is generally cylindrical in shape. Sometimes the stem narrows downwards, or is club-shaped. In colour, the stem whitish or greyish,<ref name="Phillips"/> paler at the top,<ref name="Sterry"/> and is rather weak and easily broken. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is a whitish-[[buff (colour)|buff]] colour, and is often absent in the stem, leaving it hollow.<ref name="Phillips"/> The crowded [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] can be [[decurrent]] (with the gill running down the stem) or [[adnation|adnate]] (with the entire depth of the gill connecting to the stem),<ref name="Sterry"/> and in colour are whitish to a dirty buff.<ref name="Phillips"/> They are thin and flaccid,<ref name="Rea"/> and there are three to four tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem from the cap margin).<ref name="Smith">{{cite journal |author= Smith, Alexander Hanchett |author-link= Alexander Hanchett Smith |year= 1977|title= Variation in two common North American Lactarii|journal= Kew Bulletin|volume= 31|issue= 3|pages= 449–453|issn= 0075-5974|doi=10.2307/4119385|jstor= 4119385}}</ref> The gills produce white [[latex|milk]],<ref name="Phillips"/> which dries a brownish or greenish grey after about 20 minutes.<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Kibby">{{cite book |title=Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and Northern Europe |last=Kibby |first=Geoffrey |year=2003 |publisher=[[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn]] |isbn=978-0-7537-1865-0 |page=183}}</ref> The mushroom flesh will slowly stain a greyish colour if a drop of [[Iron(II) sulfate|FeSO<sub>4</sub>]] solution is applied to it as a [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical colour test]].<ref name=Bessette2009>{{cite book |author1=Bessette, Arleen R. |author2=Bessette, Alan E. |author3=Harris, David B. |title=Milk Mushrooms of North America: A Field Guide to the Genus ''Lactarius'' |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse, New York |year=2009 |page=262 |isbn=978-0-8156-3229-0}}</ref>

===Microscopic features===
The [[spore print]] is typically a creamy white, with a slight salmon tinge,<ref name="Phillips"/> but it has been observed to vary from white to yellow depending on the density, meaning that it is not a useful means of identification.<ref name="Smith"/> Individual spores are a buff-white, [[Amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] ([[staining]] blue in [[Melzer's reagent]]) and [[hyaline]].<ref name="Pegler2"/><ref name="Bessette">{{cite book |author1=Fischer, David Hackett |author2=Bessette, Alan |author3=Bessette, Arleen R. |title=Mushrooms of Northeastern North America |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=Syracuse |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8156-0388-7}}</ref> In shape, the spores are elliptic, with a moderately well-developed network of ridges, measuring between 8 and 9.5 by 6.5 to 7.5 [[micrometre]]s&nbsp;(μm).<ref name="Phillips">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe|last= Phillips|first= Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page=87}}</ref> The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the face of the gills) are shaped like narrow [[spindle (textiles)|spindle]]s, typically measuring between 40 and 75&nbsp;μm long, but sometimes reaching 86&nbsp;μm in length, by 6 and 11&nbsp;μm wide at the widest point. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of the gills) are leaf or spindle shaped, measuring between 30 and 52&nbsp;μm long by 4 to 7&nbsp;μm wide. The [[basidia]] are four-spored and club-shaped, measuring between 36 and 42&nbsp;μm in length by 8 and 12&nbsp;μm wide.<ref name="Smith"/>

===Similar species===
''[[Lactarius uvidus]]'' is similar in appearance. In colour, it is a pale pink-buff, and its flesh turns a violet-lilac colour when cut. The white milk has a mild taste.<ref name="Kibby"/> ''[[Lactarius mammosus]]'', a species described by Fries but not often mentioned by the mycological community for some time after his death, is also similar. [[Meinhard Moser]], examining the identity of ''L.&nbsp;mammosus'', concluded that it "is certainly more closely related to ''L.&nbsp;vietus'' than to ''[[Lactarius fuscus|L. fuscus]]'',
but differs in habit and colour. The spores are slightly longer and the sculptures are less pronounced in ''L. vietus''."<ref name="Moser">{{cite journal |last1= Moser|first1= Meinhard|year= 1977|title= The problem of ''Lactarius mammosus'' Fr.|journal= Kew Bulletin|volume= 31|issue=3 |pages= 529–532|issn= 0075-5974|doi=10.2307/4119398|jstor= 4119398}}</ref>

==Edibility==
''Lactarius vietus'' milk has a very hot taste, and the mushroom lacks a distinctive smell.<ref name="Phillips"/> Although described by many mycologists as inedible,<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Jordan">{{cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe |author=Jordan, Michael |author-link=Michael Jordan (mycologist) |year=2004 |publisher=[[Frances Lincoln]] |isbn=978-0-7112-2378-3 |page=310}}</ref> [[David Pegler]] claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed.<ref name="Pegler">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Toadstools|last= Pegler|first= David N.|year= 1983|publisher= Mitchell Beazley Publishing|location= London|isbn= 0-85533-500-9|page= 98}}</ref> Though the strong, acrid taste is a defining feature of the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for ''Lactarius'' species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.<ref name="Smith"/>

==Distribution, habitat and ecology==
''Lactarius vietus'' is fairly common, and can be found growing in moist areas under trees in autumn,<ref name="Phillips"/> often among ''[[Sphagnum]]'' moss.<ref name="Sterry"/> Though it strongly favours [[birch]],<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Pegler"/> it has also been found under [[oak]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fungus associates of ectotrophic mycorrhizae |author=Trappe, James M. |volume=28 |issue=4 |journal=Botanical Review |year=1962 |pages=538–606 |issn= 0006-8101 |doi=10.1007/BF02868758|s2cid=42698903 }}</ref> It forms an [[ectomycorrhizal]] relationship with the trees under which it grows.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Rotheroe, Maurice |author2=Moore, David Scott |author3=Nauta, Marijke M. |author4=Evans, Shelley |title=Fungal Conservation: Issues and Solutions (British Mycological Society Symposia) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2008 |page=140 |isbn=978-0-521-04818-7 }}</ref> It can also be found growing on rotting wood or other hard surfaces; specimens have been observed on both [[conifer]] and [[hardwood]] logs. These are typically smaller specimens, and it is possible that they represent a [[Dwarfing|dwarf]] variety.<ref name="Smith"/> Despite growing on rotting wood, the species is not [[saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]]; instead, the [[mycelia]] of the species are linking with tree roots growing through or near the wood. This is a particularly useful adaptation when the soil is either wet or nutrient-poor.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Verbeken |first1=A. |last2=Mueller |first2=G.
