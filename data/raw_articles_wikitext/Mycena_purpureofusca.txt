'''''Mycena purpureofusca''''', commonly known as the '''purple edge bonnet''', is a species of [[agaric]] fungus in the family [[Mycenaceae]]. First described by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1885, The mushroom is named for the characteristic dark greyish-purple color of its [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] edges.

The [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have conical to bell-shaped purple [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|2.5|cm|0|abbr=on}} set atop slender [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]] up to {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} long. In the field, the mushrooms can usually be distinguished from similar species by characteristics such as the dark purple gill edges, the deep purple cap center, and its cartilagineous consistency.

The species is found in Europe and North America, where it grows on the decaying wood and debris of [[conifer]]s, including [[conifer cone|cones]]. It contains a [[laccase]] enzyme that has been investigated scientifically for its potential to detoxify recalcitrant industrial [[dye]]s used in textile [[dyeing]] and [[printing]] processes.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] as ''Agaricus purpureofuscus'' by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1885. The [[type (biology)|type]] collection was made in [[Caroga, New York]], from a moss-covered trunk of [[spruce]].<ref name="Peck 1885"/> [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] transferred it to ''[[Mycena]]'' in 1887, giving it the name by which it is currently known.<ref name="Saccardo 1887"/> [[William Alphonso Murrill]] moved it to ''Prunulus'' in 1916,<ref name="Murrill 1916"/> but this genus has since been subsumed in ''Mycena''.<ref name="Kirk 2008"/> In 1879, [[Petter Karsten]] described a collection made in Scandinavia as ''Mycena atromarginata'' var. ''fuscopurpurea'', but [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus]] later placed this in [[synonym (biology)|synonymy]] with ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca''. Another synonym, according to Maas Geesteranus,<ref name="Maas Geesteranus 1992"/> is ''Mycena sulcata'', described by [[Josef Velenovský]] in 1920 from Czechoslovakia.<ref name="Velenovský 1920"/>

[[Alexander H. Smith]] classified the species in [[section (botany)|section]] ''Calodontes'', subsection ''Ciliatae'' of ''Mycena'' in his 1947 [[monograph]] on North American ''Mycena''.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> [[Rolf Singer]] put it in the section ''Rubromarginata'' in his 1986 ''The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', a group characterized by having distinct red marginate gills.<ref name="Singer 1986"/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''purpureofuscus'' combines the [[Latin]] words ''purpur'' (purple) and ''fusco'' (dark or dusky).<ref name="Arora 1986"/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "purple edge bonnet".<ref name="Buczacki 2012"/>

==Description==


The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is conical to bell-shaped, flattening in age, and reaches a diameter of {{convert|0.5–2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=434}}</ref> The cap margin is usually bent inwards initially. The cap surface is initially covered with tiny white hairs, but later becomes smooth. It is slightly [[hygrophanous]], and when moist, is slightly translucent, so that the outline of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] underneath are apparent. Its color is dark purple in the center, fading to pale [[lilac (color)|lilac]] at the margins; older specimens are purplish-gray. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and pliant, with a texture similar to cartilage. It is initially purplish-gray, becoming pale lilac to white in age. The odor is mild<ref name="Arora 1986"/> and the taste is indistinctive.

The narrow gills have an ascending attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and are narrowly [[adnation|adnate]]. They are somewhat closely spaced, with pallid to grayish face color and dark grayish purple edges that are sometimes fringed. The tubular stipe measures {{convert|3–10|cm|abbr=on}} long by 1–3&nbsp;mm thick.<ref name="audu" /> It is tough and cartilaginous, and its base it covered with white hairs. Overall, its color is that of the cap or paler, and often paler near the top.<ref name="Smith 1947"/>

The [[Basidiospore|spore]]s are broadly [[ellipsoid]] in shape, [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and have dimensions of either 8–10 by 6–7&nbsp;[[μm]] or 10–14 by 6.7–8.5&nbsp;μm depending on whether they originated from four-or two-spored [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells), respectively. There are abundant [[cheilocystidia]] on the gill edges. They measure 30–50 by 7–12&nbsp;μm, and are fusoid-ventricose, with tips that are broadly rounded. They are filled with a purplish sap and have [[granule (cell biology)|granular]] contents. The cap tissue comprises a well-differentiated [[cap cuticle|cuticle]], a distinct hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> [[Clamp connection]]s in the hyphae are rare or absent.<ref name="urlAronsen"/>

Field characteristics that help to distinguish ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' from similar species include the dark purple gill edges, the deep purple cap center, and its cartilagineous consistency. ''[[Mycena californiensis|M.&nbsp;californiensis]]'' is similar, but has gill edges colored rosy to vinaceous-brown, and its cap is browner.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> It has an orange to orange-brown cap, a stipe the exudes red juice when injured, and grows in lead litter under [[oak]]s.<ref name="Davis 2012"/> Mitchel and Smith noted that there was considerable intergradation between the two species.<ref name="Mitchel 1978"/> The [[List of bioluminescent fungi|bioluminescent]] fungus ''[[Mycena lux-coeli|M.&nbsp;lux-coeli]]'' is another allied species, but it has smaller spores (8.5–12 by 6.5–9&nbsp;μm) and its cystidia are more lobed.<ref name="Corner 1954"/>  Another similar "bleeding" ''Mycena'' is ''[[Mycena haematopus|M.&nbsp;haematopus]]'', which usually grows in clusters on rotting wood.<ref name="Davis 2012"/> In his original protologue, Peck mentioned that he considered the species closely related to ''[[Mycena rubromarginata|M.&nbsp;rubromarginata]]'', but could be distinguished by its darker color and "non-hygrophanous striate pileus."<ref name="Peck 1885"/> Microscopically, ''M.&nbsp;rubromarginata'' differs from ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' in having abundant clamp connections and narrow necks on the cheilocystidia.<ref name="Maas Geesteranus 1992"/>

''[[Mycena bulliformis|M.&nbsp;bulliformis]]'' is another species of section ''Rubromarginatae'' that resembles ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' and is genetically its closest relative. Both share violaceous to reddish gill edges, but ''M.&nbsp;bulliformis'' typically has reddish-brown to violaceous-brown coloration rather than deep purple, and lacks the raphanoid (radish-like) odor characteristic of ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca''. In addition, the pileipellis and stipe cortical hyphae of ''M.&nbsp;bulliformis'' are not embedded in gelatinous layers, whereas in ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' they usually are.<ref name="PerryDesjardin2016">{{cite journal |last1=Perry |first1=Brian A. |last2=Desjardin |first2=Dennis E. |year=2016 |title=New species of ''Mycena'' (Basidiomycota, Agaricales) from California |journal=Phytotaxa |volume=269 |issue=1 |pages=33–40 |doi=10.11646/phytotaxa.269.1.3}}</ref>

''Mycena sanguinolenta'' – This smaller species also bleeds a reddish juice when injured. Its caps are usually under 1.5 cm across, much smaller than those of ''M. purpureofusca'', and the coloration tends to be paler reddish-brown. It is typically found in conifer duff rather than on wood.<ref name="Arora1986" />

==Habitat and distribution==


The fruit bodies grow singly or in clusters on the decaying wood of conifers,<ref name="Smith 1947"/> particularly spruce, [[pine]], and [[Douglas-fir]].<ref name="Maas Geesteranus 1992"/> It is commonly found on decaying [[pine cones]].<ref name="Davis 2012"/> In a European study, the fungus was found growing on logs in a state of decay where the wood was mostly hard, with most of the bark left, to wood that had decayed to the point that it was mostly soft throughout.<ref name="Pouska 2011"/>

In North America, the fungus has been recorded in [[North Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Michigan]], [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[California]],<ref name="Smith 1947"/> [[Virginia]],<ref name="Murrill 1916"/> and [[South Dakota]].<ref name="Gabel 2007"/> In Canada, it has been found in [[Ontario]]. Smith noted that collections from Michigan are likely to be found on old [[Tsuga|hemlock]] knots lying in the soil, where it usually fruits singly; it tends to grow in clusters on logs and stumps.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> In Europe, it has been recorded from Britain,<ref name="Emmett 1992"/> Scotland,<ref name="Heritage 2006"/> the Czech Republic,<ref name="Pouska 2011"/> Poland,<ref name="urlgrzyby.pl"/> Germany,<ref name="Gerhardt 1990"/> Turkey<ref name="Sesli 2009"/> and Austria.<ref>[https://www.pilzdaten-austria.eu/#tax/228940 Mykologische Datenbank (pilzdaten-austria.eu)].</ref> In the UK, the fungus is commonly found in [[Caledonian Forest|Caledonian pine woods]],<ref name="Orton 1986"/> and it is considered an [[indicator species]] for that habitat type.<ref name="Tofts 1998"/>

==Research==
The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown.<ref name="Davis 2012" />

The species has been investigated for its potential to decolorize industrial dyes. These dyes, used in textile dyeing and [[printing]] processes, are difficult to degrade due to their highly structured organic compounds and pose a major environmental threat. The [[mycelium]] produces high levels of [[laccase]], an [[oxidoreductase]] enzyme. Laccases are widely used in biotechnology and industry due to their ability to break down various recalcitrant compounds.<ref name="Virk 2011" /> ''M.&nbsp;purpureofusca'' laccase efficiently breaks down Remazol Brilliant Blue R, an industrially important dye that is frequently used as a starting material in the production of polymeric dyes.

[[Strobilurin&nbsp;A]] has been isolated from the fruit bodies.<ref name="Lorenzen 1998"/> Strobilurins have [[fungicidal]] activities and well known for their broad fungicidal spectrum, low toxicity against mammalian cells, and environmentally benign characteristics.<ref name="Balba 2007"/>
