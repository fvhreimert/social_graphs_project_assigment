'''''Lyophyllum decastes''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Lyophyllaceae]]. It is known as the '''clustered domecap''' in the United Kingdom<ref name="BMS">{{cite web |author=Holden L. |date=April 2022 |title=English names for fungi April 2022 |url=https://www.britmycolsoc.org.uk/field_mycology/english-names |accessdate=2024-04-16 |publisher=[[British Mycological Society]] |archive-date=2022-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221103000333/https://www.britmycolsoc.org.uk/field_mycology/english-names |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the '''fried chicken mushroom''' in North America.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |publisher=Firefly Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |location=Buffalo, NY |page=[https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil/page/56 56] |url-access=registration}}</ref> The [[basidiocarp]]s (fruit bodies) are [[agaric]]oid (gilled mushrooms). It forms large clusters on the ground. Considered [[Edible mushroom|edible]], it is cultivated in Asia.

==Description==
The caps are smooth, varied in color,<ref name=":2">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=112–113}}</ref> and range from {{Cvt|4-12|cm|frac=4}} wide. The whitish-grayish<ref name=":2" /> stalks are {{Cvt|5-10|cm|frac=4}} long and {{Cvt|1-3|cm|frac=8}} wide. The gills are white but may yellow slightly with age. The firm flesh remains white on exposure.<ref name="Expert" /> The spores are white.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

===Similar species===
''[[Lyophyllum semitale]]'' and ''[[Pluteus petasatus]]'' are similar in appearance,<ref name=":1" /> as is ''[[Lyophyllum fumosum|L.&nbsp;fumosum]]''; it and ''[[Lyophyllum loricatum|L.&nbsp;loricatum]]'' are sometimes grouped with ''L.&nbsp;decastes'' as a species complex, lacking distinct differentiating features.<ref name=":2" /> 

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species was originally described from [[Sweden]] and is widespread throughout Europe and north [[temperate]] regions. It is prolific in summer and fall until spring on the West Coast of the United States and is widely distributed in North America.<ref name="Expert" /><ref name="Phillips">{{cite book |author1=Phillips, R. |title=Mushrooms and other fungi of Great Britain & Europe |publisher=Pan Books Ltd. |year=1981 |isbn=9780330264419 |location=Cavaye Place, London SW10 9PG |page=43}} </ref> It also occurs in eastern temperate Asia.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

Growing in dense, often huge clusters on the ground, the mushrooms are usually found where the ground has been disturbed such as roadbeds, gravel, paths, landscaping areas, and sometimes in woods.<ref name = Expert>[http://www.mushroomexpert.com/lyophyllum_decastes.html Phyla and decastes description]</ref> It is variously considered [[saprotroph]]ic<ref name = Kobayashi>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kobayashi Y, Shibata TF, Hirakawa H, Nishiyama T, Yamada A, Hasebe M, Shigenobu S, Kawaguchi M |title=The genome of ''Lyophyllum shimeji'' provides insight into the initial evolution of ectomycorrhizal fungal genomes |journal=DNA Research |volume=30 |year=2023 |doi=10.1093/dnares/dsac053|pmc=9896470 }}</ref> or [[ectomycorrhiza]]l.<ref name = Agerer>{{cite journal |vauthors=Agerer R, Beenken L |year=1998 |title=''Lyophyllum decastes'' (Fr.)

==Uses==
In North America, the species is considered [[Edible mushroom|edible]] and occasionally collected in the wild, but there are some reports of [[gastric upset]]<ref name=":0" /> and possible confusion with poisonous ''[[Entoloma]]'' species or ''[[Clitocybe dilatata]]''.<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book |last1=Miller Jr. |first1=Orson K. |title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi |last2=Miller |first2=Hope H. |publisher=[[FalconGuide]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1 |location=Guilford, CN |pages=115}}</ref>
