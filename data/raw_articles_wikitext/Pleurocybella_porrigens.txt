'''''Pleurocybella porrigens''''', also known as the '''angel wing''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Phyllotopsidaceae]]. It medium-sized fruit bodies are whitish and fan-shaped. It is a [[wood-decay fungus]] on [[conifer]] wood and is widespread in [[temperate]] forests of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

== Taxonomy ==
Synonyms for the species include ''Pleurotus porrigens'', ''Phyllotus porrigens'', ''Dendrosarcus porrigens'', ''Pleurotellus porrigens'', and ''[[Nothopanus]] porrigens''.

== Description ==
The mushroom species is distinguished by its fruit bodies, pure white when young and sometimes yellowing with age.<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/135/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=135–136 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> The cap is about {{Convert|4-9|cm|frac=4}} wide, shaped like a petal or a [[Hand fan|fan]].<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=419}}</ref><ref name="Arora1986" /> The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is either very short or completely absent, and the flesh has a faint but pleasant smell.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The pocket guide to wild mushrooms : helpful tips for mushrooming in the field|last=Holmberg, Pelle.|date=2013|publisher=Skyhorse|others=Marklund, Hans, 1937-, Hedström, Ellen.|isbn=9781620877319|location=New York|oclc=816030405}}</ref> The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded, and decurrent if a stipe is present.<ref name="Arora1986" /> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and fragile compared to the oyster mushrooms (''[[Pleurotus]]'' ssp.).<ref name="amm09" /> The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name="audu" />

''P.&nbsp;porrigens'' was once generally regarded as [[edible mushroom|edible]],<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=141|author-link1=Orson K. Miller Jr.}}</ref> though bland.<ref name="Arora1986" /> As of 2011, it is a suspect in two outbreaks in Japan involving fatal [[encephalopathy]]. Most victims had preexisting [[kidney]] disorders.<ref name=beugpleuro/><ref name=sav06/><ref name=gej05/>

The first incident occurred in September and October 2004<ref name=kato2004/> across nine prefectures in Japan, documenting the sickening of 59 people and the eventual death of 17.<ref name=beugpleuro/>  Most of those who died had preexisting liver problems and the average age of those affected was 70.<ref name=beugpleuro/>  Death occurred between 13 and 29 days after the onset of symptoms, which occurred at most three weeks after consumption of the species.<ref name=kato2004/>

The second incident occurred in 2009, when a 65-year-old man who had been on [[hemodialysis]] died from acute encephalopathy after eating ''P.&nbsp;porrigens''.<ref name=beugpleuro/>

The mechanism of action for the toxicity of ''P.&nbsp;porrigens'' has not been definitively established,<ref name=beugpleuro/> but several possibilities have been suggested.  It has been demonstrated that ''P.&nbsp;porrigens'' contains an unusual [[amino acid]] which is toxic to the brain cells of rats in cell culture studies,<ref name=beugpleuro/><ref name=acie/> but it has not yet been possible to definitively determine that this was the cause of the fatal encephalopathies.<ref name=beugpleuro/>  Other mechanisms have been suggested for ''P.&nbsp;porrigens''<nowiki/>'s apparent toxicity, including the possibility that the fungus may contain toxic levels of [[cyanide]] salts.<ref name=jhs/>
