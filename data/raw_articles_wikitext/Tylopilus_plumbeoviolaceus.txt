'''''Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus''''' (formerly ''Boletus plumbeoviolaceus''), [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''violet-grey bolete''', is a [[fungus]] of the [[Boletaceae|bolete family]]. First described in 1936, the mushroom has a [[disjunct distribution]], and is distributed in North America and Korea. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of the fungus are violet when young, but fade into a chocolate brown color when mature. They are solid and relatively large—[[pileus (mycology)|cap]] diameter up to {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}, with a white pore surface that later turns pink, and a white [[mycelium]] at the base of the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The mushroom is inedible. A number of [[natural products]] have been identified from the fruit bodies, including unique [[chemical derivative]]s of [[ergosterol]], a fungal [[sterol]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was first named 1936 as ''Boletus felleus'' [[forma (botany)|forma]] ''plumbeoviolaceus'' by American mycologist [[Wally Snell|Walter H. Snell]] and one of his graduate students, [[Esther A. Dick]], based on specimens found in the [[Black Rock Forest]] near [[Cornwall, New York]].<ref name="Snell1936"/> Regarding his decision to use the taxonomic rank forma, Snell wrote: <blockquote>The writer hesitates to multiply the number of forms (formae) and varieties with distinctive names, because of the ease with which one develops the habit of interpreting slight variations as definite taxonomic units... the word "form" is used instead of "variety" as making no commitment as to the actual status of the variable segregate under consideration, until further information is available.<ref name=Snell1936/></blockquote> The first collections made of the mushroom were of young, immature specimens, from which authors were unable to obtain spores for examination. It was not until a few years after that they found mature fruit bodies, which revealed that the rosy color of the pore surface took some time to develop. They concluded that this and other differences in physical characteristics, as well as differences in [[spore]] size, were enough to justify it being a species distinct from ''[[Boletus felleus|B.&nbsp;felleus]]'', so in 1941 they raised the [[taxon]] to species status with the name ''Boletus plumbeoviolaceus''.<ref name="Snell1941"/> Noted [[Agaricales]] taxonomist [[Rolf Singer]] later transferred the [[taxon]] to ''[[Tylopilus]]'' in 1947,<ref name="Singer1947"/> a genus characterized by a [[spore print]] that is pink, or [[wine (color)|wine red]] (vinaceous), rather than brown as in ''Boletus''.<ref name="Watling IV 1977"/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''"plumbeoviolaceus"'' is coined from the [[Latin]] adjectives ''plumbeus'' ("leaden" or "lead-colored") and ''violaceus'' ("purple").<ref>{{cite book |author=Simpson DP |title=Cassell's Latin Dictionary |publisher=Cassell Ltd. |year=1979 |edition=5th |location=London |isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "violet-grey bolete".<ref name="NJMA"/>

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] is {{convert|7|to|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially convex in shape but becoming centrally depressed, with a broadly arched and rounded margin.<ref name="Grund1976"/> Young specimens are rather hard and firm, and the cap has a finely velvet-textured surface that soon wears off to become smooth.<ref name="Snell1941"/> The color of the fruit body is violet when young, but dulls as it ages, becoming a dull violet-purplish-gray, then eventually chocolate-brown at maturity. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is solid, white, and does not change color when cut or bruised. The taste is bitter, and the odor is not distinctive.<ref name="Grund1976"/> Mycologist [[David Arora]] calls the mushroom "beautiful, but bitter-tasting".<ref name="Arora1986"/>

The tubes on the underside of the cap are {{convert|0.4|to|1.8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} deep, 2 or three per millimeter, depressed at the stem (resulting in an [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] attachment). The color of the pore surface is initially white, and it remains so for a while before turning a rosy color at maturity. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|8|to|13|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2.5|to|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, enlarged at the base, and sometimes bulbous. The surface is slightly [[wikt:reticulate|reticulate]] at the top, and smooth lower of the stem. Its color is [[buff (color)|buff]] to light brown, often with darker brown bruises or stains, and it has whitish [[mycelium]] at the base. The flesh of the stem is white, and it does not change color when cut or bruised.<ref name="Grund1976"/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
Collected in deposit, like with a [[spore print]], the spores of ''T.&nbsp;plumbeoviolaceus'' appear to be a light pink to flesh color. When viewed with a [[light microscope]], they are elliptical, with smooth walls and dimensions of 9.1–12.3 by 3.4–4.5&nbsp;[[μm]]. The [[basidia]] (cellular structures that produce the spores) are club-shaped, and measure about 26 by 6.5&nbsp;μm. The cuticle of the cap (the [[pileipellis]]) is made of a tangle of smooth-walled, narrow, brownish hyphae. When stained in [[potassium hydroxide]], the hyphal contents tend to form beads, while staining in [[Melzer's reagent]] causes the pigment to form globules.<ref name="Wolfe1986"/> [[Cystidia]] are common in the [[hymenium|hymenial]] tissue; they are swollen at the base and narrow at the apex (lageniform), measuring 30–40&nbsp;μm long by 7–9&nbsp;μm thick.<ref name="Snell1941"/> [[Clamp connection]]s are absent in the [[hypha]]e.<ref name="Smith1971"/>

===Edibility===
''T.&nbsp;plumbeoviolaceous'' is considered inedible, and has a strongly bitter taste.<ref name="NJMA"/> The presence of a bitter bolete may spoil a meal, as the bitter taste does not disappear with cooking.<ref name="Singer1986"/>

===Similar species===

There are few other species that might be confused with ''T.&nbsp;plumbeoviolaceus''; according to one source, it "is one of the most remarkable and easily identified boletes in the USA".<ref name="Kibby1994"/> ''[[Tylopilus violatinctus]]'', found under both hardwoods and conifers and known from [[New York (state)|New York]] to [[Mississippi]], has a similar appearance. It can be distinguished by a paler, lilac-colored cap that, in older specimens, is discolored rusty purple along the edge of the cap. Its spores are 7–10 by 3–4&nbsp;μm. As ''Tylopilus violatinctus'' was not described until 1998,<ref name="urlFungorum"/> some older literature may confuse the two species.<ref name="Kuo"/>

Young specimens of ''[[Tylopilus rubrobrunneus]]'' have a purplish cap, but unlike ''T.&nbsp;plumbeoviolaceous'', their stems are never purple.<ref name="urlTylopilus rubrobrunneus"/> The species ''Tylopilus microsporus'', known only from China, is characterized by pale violet to violet cap, paler purple to purplish brown stem, and flesh color to pale purplish red pores. In addition to its different distribution, it can be distinguished from ''T.&nbsp;plumbeoviolaceus'' by its smaller spores.<ref name="Fu2006"/> Another similar Asian species, ''[[Tylopilus obscureviolaceus|T.&nbsp;obscureviolaceus]]'', is only known from the [[Yaeyama Islands]] in southwestern Japan. It differs from ''T.&nbsp;plumbeoviolaceous'' in having a cap that does not fade in color to grayish or brownish when mature, shorter spores (6–7.2 by 3.3–4&nbsp;μm), and other microscopic characteristics.<ref name=Takahashi2004/>

==Habitat and distribution==

''Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceous'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species,<ref name="Kuo"/> and the bulk of the fungus lives underground, associating in a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the roots of various tree species. The fruit bodies are found growing singly, scattered or clustered together during mid-summer to autumn in [[deciduous forest]]s, often under [[beech]] or [[oak]] trees; however, it sometimes occurs in [[mixed forest|mixed hardwood-conifer forests]] under [[tsuga|hemlock]].<ref name="Grund1976"/> A preference for sandy soil has been noted.<ref name="Smith1971"/> In North America, the mushroom can be found in the west from June to September,<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=364}}</ref> and east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] from Canada to Mexico.<ref name="Kuo"/> The species has also been collected in [[North Korea]].<ref name="Wojewoda1993"/>

== Ecology ==
Fruit bodies can serve as a food source for fungus-feeding ''[[Drosophila]]'' flies.<ref name="Kimura1980" />

==Bioactive compounds==
Two [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of [[ergosterol]] have been isolated from the fruit bodies of ''T.&nbsp;plumbeoviolaceus'': tylopiol A (3β-hydroxy-8α,9α-oxido-8,9-secoergosta-7,9(11),22-triene) and tylopiol B (3β-hydroxy-8α,9α-oxido-8,9-secoergosta-7,22dien-12-one). These sterols are unique to this species. Additionally, the compounds ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol, [[uridine]], [[allitol]], ergosterol, ergosterol&nbsp;5α,8α-peroside, [[ergothioneine]], [[adenosine]], and [[uracil]] have been identified from the mushrooms.<ref name="Wu2000"/><ref name="Wu2009"/>
