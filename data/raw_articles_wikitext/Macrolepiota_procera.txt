'''''Macrolepiota procera''''', the '''parasol mushroom''', is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus with a large, prominent [[fruiting body]] resembling a [[parasol]].

It is a fairly common species on well-drained soils. It is found solitary or in groups and [[fairy ring]]s in [[pasture]]s and occasionally in [[woodland]]. It is widespread in [[temperate]] regions of Eurasia and possibly North America. It is a well regarded [[edible mushroom]] but does closely resembles some toxic species.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was first [[species description|described]] in 1772 by Italian naturalist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]], who named it ''Agaricus procerus''.<ref name="Scopoli 1772"/> [[Rolf Singer]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Macrolepiota]]'' in 1948.<ref name="Singer 1948"/>

==Description==
The immature cap is compact and [[egg-shaped]], with the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] margin around the stipe, sealing a chamber inside the cap. As it matures, the margin breaks off, leaving a fleshy, movable [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] around the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. The stipe is relatively thin, growing up to 12–40&nbsp;cm long and 1.5&nbsp;cm thick,<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/298/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=298-99 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> reaching its full height before the cap expands.

Dark and cap-coloured flakes remain on the upper surface of the cap and can be removed easily.

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s are crowded, free, and white or pale pink in age. The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name="Arora1986" /> It has a pleasant nutty smell. When sliced, the white flesh may turn a pale pink.

=== Similar species ===
The parasol mushroom is difficult to mistake for any other, especially in regions like Europe where the poisonous look-alike ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' is rare. The spores and lamellae of ''C.&nbsp;molybdites'' are notably greener in appearance.<ref name="Miller2006" /> Nevertheless, as with picking any fungus for consumption, caution should be exercised at all times.

Smaller but similar in appearance is the common [[shaggy parasol]] (''Chlorophyllum rhacodes''), with an overlapping geographical range. ''Chlorophyllum rhacodes'' and other species in ''[[Chlorophyllum]]'' section Rhacodium lack the aforementioned snakeskin pattern on the stipe.

''[[Macrolepiota mastoidea]]'', a European species, is yet another very large edible mushroom. Its dimensions are generally smaller than that of ''M.&nbsp;procera'' and the markings on its stipe less obvious. It is also much rarer.

Species of ''[[Agaricus]]'' have brown spores and the gills of mature specimens are never white.

There are a few poisonous species which can be mistaken for ''M.&nbsp;procera''. 
*''Chlorophyllum molybdites'' causes the largest number of annual mushroom poisonings in [[North America]] due to its close similarity. Faintly green gills and a pale green spore print give it away. Furthermore, this mushroom lacks the aforementioned snakeskin pattern that is generally present on the parasol mushroom.<ref>{{Cite web |title=How to not pass up a parasol and how not to |url=http://www.alanmuskat.com/articles/parasol2.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214040731/http://www.alanmuskat.com/articles/parasol2.htm |archive-date=14 December 2017 |access-date=28 November 2009}}</ref> Its range is reportedly expanding into Europe.<ref>[http://www.bio.net/bionet/mm/mycology/1996-September/004542.html Macrolepiota rhacodes and Chlorophyllum molybdites poisoning<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>Loizides M, Kyriakou T, Tziakouris A.

*''[[Leucocoprinus brunnea]]'', also found in North America, slowly turns brown when sliced.
*White and immature species of ''[[Amanita]]'' are also a potential hazard. To be sure, one must only pick parasol mushrooms past their button stage. A general [[rule of thumb]] with the parasol mushroom as compared to amanita species is that the parasol mushroom has darker flakes on a lighter surface, whereas amanita species have the opposite, lighter flakes (if there are any) on a darker surface, such as the [[Amanita pantherina|Panther cap]]. This rule of thumb does not apply everywhere like to the species ''[[Amanita smithiana]]''.
*The '''Saffron Parasol''' ''[[Cystoderma amianthinum]]'' is very much smaller, and not often eaten.
*''[[Lepiota brunneoincarnata]]'' is a lepiota species known to have caused fatal poisonings in Spain. It is much smaller than ''M.&nbsp;procera''.

==Habitat and distribution==
It is a fairly common species on well-drained soils. It is found solitary or in groups and [[fairy ring]]s in [[pasture]]s and occasionally in [[woodland]]. It is widespread in [[temperate]] regions of Eurasia and possibly North America. Further research is needed to confirm whether specimens found in North America are the same species.<ref>{{cite web |title=Macrolepiota procera |url=https://www.mushroomexpert.com/macrolepiota_procera.html |access-date=Jan 26, 2024}}</ref>

In some parts of Europe, it is known as the "snake's hat" or "snake's sponge" due to its scales.

==Uses==
 mushroom]]

''Macrolepiota procera'' is a choice [[edible mushroom]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=34}}</ref><ref name="Miller2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=53}}</ref> It is very sought after and popular in Europe, due in part to its large size, seasonal frequency, and versatility in the kitchen. In the UK, it may be found from July through to November. The stipe is inedible due to being very fibrous in texture, unless dried and ground into a powder.

''Macrolepiota procera'' is also edible raw, though its close lookalikes in the genus ''Chlorophyllum'' are toxic raw.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

These mushrooms are popularly sauteed in melted butter. In central and eastern European countries this mushroom is usually prepared similarly to a [[cutlet]]. It is usually run through egg and [[breadcrumbs]] and then fried in a pan with some oil or butter. A savory Slovak recipe is to bake caps stuffed with ground pork, oregano, and garlic. Italians and Austrians also serve the young, still spherical caps stuffed with seasoned minced beef, baked in the same manner as stuffed peppers.
