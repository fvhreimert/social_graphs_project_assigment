'''''Chalciporus piperatus''''', commonly known as the '''peppery bolete''',<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/517/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=517 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> is a species of fungus in the family [[Boletaceae]]. Described by [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] in 1790 as ''Boletus piperatus'', it is only distantly related to other members of the genus ''[[Boletus]]'' and was reclassified as ''Chalciporus piperatus'' by [[Frédéric Bataille]] in 1908. The genus ''[[Chalciporus]]'' was an early branching [[lineage (evolution)|lineage]] in the Boletaceae and appears to be related to boletes with [[parasitic]] properties.

A small bolete, the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] has a {{convert|1.6–9|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} orange-fawn [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with small cinnamon to brown pores underneath. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|4–9.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} long and {{convert|0.6–1.2|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}}. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has a very peppery taste. The rare [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''hypochryseus'', found only in Europe, has yellow pores and tubes. The species is found in mixed woodland in Europe and North America. It has been recorded under [[introduced species|introduced]] trees in Brazil, and has become [[naturalization (biology)|naturalised]] in [[Tasmania]] and spread under native ''[[Nothofagus cunninghamii]]'' trees. Previously thought to be [[ectomycorrhiza]]l (a&nbsp;[[symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] that occurs between a fungus and the roots of various plant species), ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' is now suspected of being parasitic on ''[[Amanita muscaria]]''.

==Taxonomy==
French mycologist [[Pierre Bulliard]] described the species as ''Boletus piperatus'' in 1790.<ref name="Bulliard 1790"/> In its [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history, it has been transferred to the genera ''[[Leccinum]]'' ([[Samuel Frederick Gray]], 1821), ''Viscipellis'' ([[Lucien Quélet]], 1886), ''Ixocomus'' (Quélet, 1888), ''[[Suillus]]'' ([[Otto Kuntze]], 1898), and ''Ceriomyces'' ([[William Alphonso Murrill]], 1909).<ref name="urlMycoBank: Chalciporus piperatus"/> It was reclassified and given its current [[binomial name]] in 1908 by [[Frédéric Bataille]] when he made it the [[type species]] of the newly circumscribed genus ''Chalciporus''.<ref name="Bataille 1908"/>  The [[botanical name|species name]] ''piperatus'' means "peppery" in [[Latin]].<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "peppery bolete".<ref name="BMS"/>

''Chalciporus piperatus'' is a member of the genus ''[[Chalciporus]]'', with which the genus ''[[Buchwaldoboletus]]'' form a group of fungi that is an early offshoot in the [[Boletaceae]]. Many members of the group appear to be [[parasitic]].<ref name="Nuhn 2013"/>

Two [[variety (botany)|varieties]] have been described. ''Chalciporus piperatus'' var. ''hypochryseus'' was originally described as ''Boletus hypochryseus'' by Czech mycologist Josef Šutara in 1993,<ref name="Šutara 1993"/> and was moved to ''Chalciporus'' a year later by Regis Courtecuisse.<ref name="Courtecuisse 1994"/> Wolfgang Klofac and Irmgard Krisai-Greilhuber reclassified it as a variety of ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' in 2006,<ref name="Klofac 2006"/> although some sources continue to regard it as a distinct species.<ref name="Šutara 2009"/> Variety ''amarellus'', first published by Quélet as ''Boletus amarellus'' in 1883 and later transferred to ''Chalciporus'' by Bataille in 1908, was described as a variety of ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' in 1974 by [[Albert Pilát]] and [[Aurel Dermek]]. Authorities disagree as to whether or not it has independent taxonomic significance.<ref name="urlFungorum"/><ref name="MycoBank: Chalciporus amarellus"/>

==Description==

One of the smaller boletes, ''Chalciporus piperatus '' has an orange-fawn {{convert|1.6–9|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is initially convex before flattening out in age.<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> The cap surface can be furrowed;<ref name="Lamaison 2005"/> shiny when dry,<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> it can be a little sticky when wet,<ref name="Lamaison 2005"/> and may crack with age.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=220}}</ref> The colour of the pore surface ranges from yellowish<ref name=":1" /> to dark reddish brown in maturity. When bruised, the pore surface stains brown. Individual pores are angular, measuring about 0.5–2&nbsp;mm wide, while the tubes are 3–10&nbsp;mm deep.<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> Slender for a bolete,<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] measures {{convert|4–9.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} long by {{convert|0.6–1.2|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick, and is either roughly the same width throughout its length, or slightly thicker near the base. The colour of the stem is similar to the cap, or lighter, and there is yellow [[mycelium]] at the base. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is yellow, sometimes with reddish tones, maturing to purplish brown. It has no odour. The [[spore print]] is brown to cinnamon.<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> Variety ''hypochryseus'' is essentially identical to the main form except for its bright yellow tubes and pores.<ref name="Šutara 1993"/> Variety ''amarellus'' has pinker pores and a taste that is bitter rather than peppery.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/>



The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are smooth, narrowly fusiform (fuse-shaped), and measure 7–12 by 3–5&nbsp;[[μm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) measure 20–28 by 6–8&nbsp;μm and are [[hyaline]] (translucent), four-spored, and narrowly club-shaped, with many internal oil droplets. The [[cystidia]] are fusiform, sometimes with a rounded tip, and have dimensions of 30–50 by 9–12&nbsp;μm. Some are more or less hyaline, while others are encrusted with a golden pigment.<ref name="Alessio 1985"/> The [[cap cuticle]] is a trichodermium, an arrangement in which the outermost [[hypha]]e emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface. These hyphae are 10–17&nbsp;μm wide and have elliptical to cylindrical cells at their ends that are not gelatinous. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent from the hyphae.<ref name="Smith 1971"/>

===Similar species===
The fruit body of the North American species ''[[Chalciporus piperatoides]]'' are similar, but can be distinguished by its flesh and pores staining blue after cutting or bruising. It has a less peppery taste.<ref name="Baroni 1991"/> Another mild-tasting relative, ''[[Chalciporus rubinellus|C.&nbsp;rubinellus]]'', has brighter colours than ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'', including completely red tubes.<ref name="Groves 1979"/> One European species, ''[[Chalciporus rubinus|C.&nbsp;rubinus]]'', has a shape similar to ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'', but has red pores and a stem covered in red dots.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
'' (pictured).]]

Fruit bodies of ''Chalciporus piperatus'' occur singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground.<ref name="Smith 1971"/> The fungus occurs naturally in or near [[conifer]]ous or [[beech]] and [[oak]] [[woodland]]s, often on sandy soils.<ref name="Carluccio 2003"/> Fruit bodies appear in Europe in late summer and autumn from August to November.<ref name="Haas 1969"/> The fungus is widespread across North America, fruiting from July to October in the eastern states and from September to January on the Pacific Coast.<ref name="Audubonguide"/> It is found in Mexico and Central America.<ref name="Klofac 2006"/> In Asia, it has been collected from Pakistan,<ref name="Razaq 2013"/> [[West Bengal]] (India),<ref name="Shajahan 1995"/> and [[Guangdong Province]] (China).<ref name="Zhishu 1993"/> In South Africa, it is known from the southwestern [[Cape Province]] and the eastern [[Transvaal Province]].<ref name="Westhuizen 1994"/>

''Chalciporus piperatus'' grows in conifer plantations associated with the fly agaric (''[[Amanita muscaria]]'') and the chanterelle (''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'').<ref name="Haas 1969"/> It has been recorded under introduced loblolly pine (''[[Pinus taeda]]'') plantations in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] states in southern Brazil,<ref name="Sulzbacher 2013"/> and under introduced trees in the [[Los Lagos Region]] of Chile.<ref name="Valenzuela 1999"/> It has also spread into native forest in northeastern [[Tasmania]] and Victoria, having been found growing with the native myrtle beech (''[[Nothofagus cunninghamii]]'').<ref name="Fuhrer 1992"/><ref name="Dunk 2012"/> The rare variety ''hypochryseus'' occurs only in Europe, including Austria, Czechia, Greece, Italy, and Spain.<ref name="Šutara 2009"/> Also rare, variety ''amarellus'' is widespread in European coniferous forests, where it usually found near [[pine]]s, [[spruce]], and sometimes [[fir]].<ref name="Klofac 2006"/>

Fruit bodies can be parasitised by the mould ''[[Sepedonium chalcipori]]'', a highly specialised [[mycoparasite]] that is only known to infect this bolete. Infections result in [[necrotic]] mushroom tissue and the production of copious yellow [[conidia]].<ref name="Toniolo 2009"/>

Initially thought to be [[ectomycorrhiza]]l ([[symbiotic]] with plants, like most Boletaceae), ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' has not been confirmed as such in multiple synthesis studies<ref name="Godbout 1985"/><ref name="Kasuya 1996"/><ref name="Yamada 1995"/> or in [[isotope fractionation]] studies.<ref name="Hogberg 1999"/><ref name="Zeller 2007"/><ref name="Tedersoo 2010"/> There is some speculation that ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' is a mycoparasite on the mycorrhiza of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria''.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> In New Zealand, ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' is thought to have been [[introduced species|introduced]] with ''[[Pinus radiata]]'', and has made a [[host (biology)|host]] jump to the native ''[[Nothofagus]]'' trees; ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' has since been observed fruiting near ''Nothofagus'' trees with ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' associations.<ref name="Dunk 2012"/><ref name="Tedersoo 2010"/>  ''[[Buchwaldoboletus lignicola]]'' is in the same [[clade]] as ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' and is thought to be a parasite as well, strengthening the evidence that ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' and its relatives may be mycoparasites.<ref name="Nuhn 2013"/>

==Uses==


This mushroom contains [[Mycotoxin|toxins]]<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=385|author-link=Orson K. Miller Jr.}}</ref> and is usually considered inedible.<ref name="Nilper 1977" /><ref name="Roberts 2011" /> It has been used as a condiment in many countries, with the Italian chef [[Antonio Carluccio]] recommending it be used only to add its peppery flavour to other mushrooms.<ref name="Carluccio 2003"/> Some recommend that it be well-cooked before consumption to minimize the risk of gastric symptoms,<ref name="Audubonguide"/> but the peppery taste is lost with cooking,<ref name="Thiers 1975"/> and even more so by reducing it to a powdered form.<ref name="Bresinsky 1989"/>

Fruit bodies can be used for [[mushroom dye]]ing; depending on the [[mordant]] used, yellow, orange, or greenish-brown dyes can be made.<ref name="Roberts 2011" />

==Chemistry==
[[Sclerocitrin]], a [[biological pigment|pigment]] compound originally isolated from the common earthball (''[[Scleroderma citrinum]]''), is the major contributor to the yellow colour of the mycelium and the stipe base of ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' fruit bodies. Other compounds that have been isolated from this species include [[norbadione A|norbadione&nbsp;A]], [[chalciporone]], [[xerocomic acid]], [[variegatic acid]], [[variegatorubin]], and another yellow pigment, [[chalcitrin]]. Chalciporone is responsible for the bitter taste of the fruit bodies. The pigments sclerocitrin, chalcitrin, and norbadione&nbsp;A are derived [[biosynthesis|biosynthetically]] from xerocomic acid.<ref name="Winner 2004"/> Related compounds found in the fruit bodies include the chalciporone [[isomer]]s isochalciporone and dehydroisochalciporone.<ref name="Yannai 2013"/>

A field study of fungi growing in polluted sites in Czechia and Slovakia found that ''C.&nbsp;piperatus'' fruit bodies growing near lead [[smelters]] and on mine and [[slag]] dumps had the greatest ability to [[bioaccumulate]] the element [[antimony]]. In one collection, an "extremely high" level of the element was detected—1423 milligrams of antimony per kilogram of dried mushroom. In comparison, the antimony levels detected in other common terrestrial fungi from the same area, both [[saprobic]] and ectomycorrhizal, were more than an [[order of magnitude]] smaller.<ref name="Borovička 2006"/>
