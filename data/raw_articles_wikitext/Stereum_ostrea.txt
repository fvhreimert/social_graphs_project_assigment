'''''Stereum ostrea''''', also called '''false turkey-tail''' and '''golden curtain crust''', is a [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] in the genus ''[[Stereum]]''. It is a plant [[pathogen]] and a wood decay [[fungus]]. The name ''ostrea'', from the word '[[oyster]]', describes its shape.<ref name=emberger/>
With concentric circles of many colors, it highly resembles ''[[Trametes versicolor]]'', turkey-tail, and is thus called the 'false turkey-tail'. The stemless fruiting body is shell-like and grows {{convert|1|-|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} high. It is tough and inedible. It grows on tree bark. This fungus is native to the island of Java, Indonesia and has been misapplied to the North American Stereum species [[Stereum fasciatum]], [[Stereum lobatum]], and [[Stereum subtomentosum]].<ref name="DeLong-Duhon Bagley Forbes 2020 p.

==Description==
It gets its name 'false turkey-tail' because it mimics ''[[Trametes versicolor]]''. They can be distinguished as  ''T. versicolor'' [[polypore|has numerous pores]] on the underside of its fruiting body, unlike ''S. ostrea''.<ref name=volk>{{cite web|last=Volk|first=Thomas J.|title=Stereum ostrea|url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/nov2000.html|website=University of Wisconsin-La Crosse|access-date=29 September 2012|date=November 2000}}</ref> Also, ''S. ostrea'' is more red in color. Factors such as its relatively large size and shell-like (not flat) body distinguish it from other members of the genus ''Stereum''.<ref name=kuo>{{cite web|last=Kuo|first=Michael|title=Stereum ostrea|url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/stereum_ostrea.html|publisher=MushroomExpert.Com|access-date=1 October 2012|date=December 2008}}</ref>

The fruiting body is {{convert|1|-|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, shaped like a shell and thin. Its surface can be hairy or smooth at the very first, growing smoother with age. The concentric zones can have a variety of colors - ranging from yellowish red to a dark brown. If [[algae]] grow on it, the color can change to green. The flesh is very thin and too tough to eat, with no distinct odor.<ref name=kuo/> The fungus lacks a stem. The underside is smooth and lacks pores, white to gray or a reddish-brown shade in color. The spore is white, and measures {{convert|5.5|-|7.5|µm|mm|abbr=on}} x {{convert|2|-|3|µm|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=kuo/><ref name=alan>{{cite book|last=Bessette|first=Alan E.|title=Mushrooms of the southeastern United States|year=2007|publisher=Syracuse Univ.

==Chemical properties==
''Stereum ostrea'' produces lignolytic enzymes, which decompose [[lignin]]. The enzyme production was compared for ten days with ''[[Phanerochaete chrysosporium]]'', in a liquid medium. ''S. ostrea'' produced a higher number of [[laccase]], lignin peroxidase and manganese peroxidase enzymes. the discoloration of the dye Remazol confirmed the presence of enzymes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Praveen|first1=K.|last2=Viswanath|first2=B.|last3=Usha|first3=K.Y.|last4=Pallavi|first4=H.|last5=Reddy|first5=G.V.S.|last6=Naveen|first6=M.|last7=Reddy|first7=B.R.|title=Lignolytic enzymes of a mushroom ''Stereum ostrea'' isolated from wood logs|journal=Enzyme Research|date=2011|volume=2011|article-number=749518|doi=10.4061/2011/749518|pmid=21941632|pmc=3176490 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Reddy|first1=B.R.|last2=Praveen|first2=K.|last3=Usha|first3=K.Y.|title=Studies on Manganese Peroxidase of a mushroom - ''Stereum Ostrea'' Production, Purification and Characterization of Mn peroxidase of a Mushroom - ''Stereum ostrea'': An Experimental Approach|date=2012|publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing|location=Saarbrücken|isbn=978-3-659-15480-5|edition=1st}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Vishwanath|first1=B.|last2=Chandra|first2=M.S.|last3=Kumar|first3=K.P. |last4=Reddy |first4=B.R.|title=Production and purification of laccase from Stereum ostrea and its ability to decolorize textile dyes|journal=Dynamic Biochemistry, Process Biotechnology and Molecular Biology|year=2008|volume=2|issue=1|pages=19–25}}</ref>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Stereum ostrea'' is [[saprophytic]] in nature. It is a [[Plant pathology|plant pathogen]], growing on hardwood tree barks, especially oak, and decaying parts. It leaves white deposits in these places. It grows individually, but in a dense manner. ''[[Phlebia incarnata]]'', another fungus, is most commonly found growing alongside or even intermingled with this species. This fungus can be [[Parasitism|parasitized]] by [[jelly fungi]]. It grows all  year round and is found in Indonesia.<ref name="DeLong-Duhon Bagley Forbes 2020 p. "/>
