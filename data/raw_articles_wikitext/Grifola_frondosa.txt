It is native to China, Europe, and North America.

It is an [[edible mushroom]] long used in [[East Asian cuisine]] and studied for its potential [[health]] benefits, though no high-quality clinical evidence supports its medicinal use.

==Description==
Like the [[sulphur shelf]] mushroom, ''G. frondosa'' is a [[perennial]] fungus that often grows in the same place for several years in succession.

''G. frondosa'' grows from an underground [[tuber]]-like structure known as a [[sclerotium]], about the size of a [[potato]].<ref name="Arora1986" /> The fruiting body, individually up to {{Convert|10|cm|frac=4}} across but whole clumps up to {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}},<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |pages=124}}</ref> rarely {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on|-1}}, is a cluster consisting of multiple grayish-brown [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]]s which are often curled or spoon-shaped, with wavy margins and {{convert|2-10|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} broad.<ref name="Phillips">{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |publisher=Firefly Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |location=Buffalo, NY |page=300}}</ref> The undersurface of each cap bears about one to three pores per millimeter, with the tubes rarely deeper than {{convert|3|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Phillips/> The cream-coloured [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (stalk) has a branchy structure<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=263}}</ref> and becomes tough as the mushroom matures.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}<ref>{{Cite book |last=McIlvaine |first=Charles |title=One Thousand American Fungi |last2=Macadam |first2=Robert |publisher=Dover Publications, Inc |year=1973 |isbn=0486227820 |location=New York |pages=483 |language=en}}</ref>

===Similar species===
''G. frondosa'' is a very distinct mushroom except for its cousin, the black staining mushroom, which is similar in taste but rubbery. Edible species which look similar to ''G.&nbsp;frondosa'' include ''[[Meripilus sumstinei]]'' (which stains black), ''[[Sparassis|Sparassis spathulata]]''<ref>{{cite book |last=Meuninck |first=Jim |title=Foraging Mushrooms Oregon: Finding, Identifying, and Preparing Edible Wild Mushrooms |date=2017 |publisher=[[Falcon Guides]] |isbn=978-1-4930-2669-2 |page=114}}</ref> and ''[[Laetiporus sulphureus]]'', another edible [[bracket fungus]] that is commonly called [[chicken of the woods]] or "sulphur shelf". ''[[Polyporus umbellatus]]'' has distinct roundish caps.<ref name="audu" />

==Distribution and habitat==
It is native to [[China]], Europe (August to October),<ref name="tfb" /> and eastern North America<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Meuninck |first1=Jim |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldXRCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA14 |title=Jim Meuninck - Basic Illustrated Edible and Medicinal Mushrooms, pp. 13-14, Rowman & Littlefield, 1 Jun 2015 |date=2015-06-01 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781493014682 |access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref> (from September to October).<ref name="audu" />

It occurs most prolifically in eastern North America, but has been found as far west as [[Idaho]].<ref name="Arora1986" />

==Uses==

=== Research ===
Although under [[basic research|laboratory]] and preliminary [[clinical research]] for many years, particularly for the possible biological effects of its [[polysaccharide]]s, there are no [[evidence-based medicine|completed, high-quality Phase III clinical studies]] for the species {{as of|2019|lc=y}}.<ref name="drugs" /><ref name="msk">{{cite web |date=2019 |title=Maitake |url=https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/integrative-medicine/herbs/maitake |access-date=19 December 2019 |publisher=Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center}}</ref>

There are reviews of D-faction extracted from Maitake, including completed Phase I/II [[clinical trial]] demonstrating that "Treatment with sulfated polysaccharide obtained from Grifola frondosa (S-GFB) resulted in apoptosis of HepG2 cells", and "In a phase I/II trial of breast cancer survivors, Grifola frondosa extract acted as an immunomodulator." Same trial has concluded: "There appears to be no “maximum dose”, only “optimal dose” depending on the immunologic endpoint."[https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3751581/]
