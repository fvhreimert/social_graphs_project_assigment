'''''Galerina sulciceps''''' is a dangerously [[Mushroom poisoning|toxic]] species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Strophariaceae]], of the order [[Agaricales]]. It is distributed in [[tropical]] Indonesia and India, but has reportedly been found fruiting in European greenhouses on occasion. More toxic than the [[Amanita phalloides|deathcap]] (''Amanita phalloides''), ''G.&nbsp;sulciceps'' has been shown to contain the toxins [[alpha-amanitin|alpha-]] (α-), [[beta-amanitin|beta-]] (β-) and [[gamma-amanitin|gamma-]] (γ-) amanitin; a series of poisonings in Indonesia in the 1930s resulted in 14 deaths from the consumption of this species. It has a typical "[[little brown mushroom]]" appearance, with barely any obvious external characteristics to help differentiate it from many other similar undistinguished brown species. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of the fungus are [[tawny (color)|tawny]] to [[ochre]], deepening to reddish-brown at the base of the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are well-separated, and there is no [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] present on the stem.

==History and taxonomy==
This species was first described in the literature as ''[[Marasmius]] sulciceps'' by English Naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] in 1848, based on a specimen found four years earlier growing on old wood in Ceylon (modern-day [[Sri Lanka]]).<ref name=Berkeley1847/> In 1898, [[Otto Kuntze]] transferred the species to ''Chamaeceras'',<ref name=Kuntze1898/> a genus that has since been subsumed back into ''Marasmius''.<ref name=Kirk2008/> Due to its brown-colored [[spore print]], Dutch mycologist [[Karel Bernard Boedijn]] transferred the species to the genus ''[[Phaeomarasmius]]'' in 1938.<ref name=Boedijn1938/> In 1951, he redescribed the species and transferred it to its current position in ''[[Galerina]]''.<ref name=Boedijn1951/> [[Rolf Singer]]'s comprehensive [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] treatment of the [[Agaricales]] placed ''Galerina sulciceps'' in [[section (biology)|section]] ''Naucoriopsis'' of the genus ''Galerina'', a subdivision first defined by French mycologist [[Robert Kühner]] in 1935.<ref name=Kuhner1935/> This section includes small brown-spored fungi that when young have a cap margin curved inward, and thin-walled, obtuse, or acute-ended [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] which are not broadly rounded at the top.<ref name=Singer1986/> All of the poisonous amatoxin-containing ''Galerina'' belong to section ''Naucoriopsis''.<ref name=Enjalbert2004/>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially egg-shaped in young specimens, but changes shape as it matures, becoming convex and later more or less flat with a central depression. At the center of the cap is a roughly spherical [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] – a nipple-like protrusion. The cap is [[hygrophanous]], meaning it changes color depending on its state of hydration: the color is tawny in moist specimens, changing to ochre with dark brown edges when dried.<ref name=Bresinsky1989/> The cap diameter is typically {{convert|1.5|to|4|cm|in|abbr=on|1}}, with a surface that is smooth, and almost gelatinous in consistency. The edge of the cap is thin and wavy, and is often split open. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are broadly [[adnation|adnate]] (attached to the stalk slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem) to slightly decurrent (running down the length of the stem). Interspersed between the gills are shorter gills, called lamellulae, that start from the cap, but do not reach the stem. The gills are broad (up to 4&nbsp;mm) and thick at the base (1&nbsp;mm), and when mature can develop veins that run between the gills on the undersurface of the cap. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|0.4|to|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long, {{convert|0.15|to|0.3|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and usually attached centrally to the underside of the cap, although it may sometimes be slightly off-center. Stems are solid, cylindrical, and may be [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (dusted with a very fine layer of powder).<ref name=Smith1963/>

Berkeley's original description noted a resemblance to a small ''Marasmius peronatus'',<ref name=Berkeley1847/> a mushroom today known as ''[[Gymnopus peronatus]]''.<ref name="url Fungorum - Names Record"/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
The [[spore]]s are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to almond-shaped, with dimensions of 7.2–9.7 by 4.5–5.8&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name=Smith1963/> The [[basidium|basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to slightly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30–45 by 5.5–6&nbsp;μm. The [[sterigmata]] (projections of the basidia that attach the spores) are 5–6&nbsp;μm long.<ref name=Bresinsky1989/> The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] located in the gill face) are thin-walled, with long, somewhat cylindrical necks, and may range in color from translucent ([[hyaline]]) to pale brownish-yellow. They are typically 40 by 10.5&nbsp;μm, although they may occasionally be larger—up to 142 by 18 by 8&nbsp;μm. Cystidia in the gill edge—the cheilocystidia—are similar in appearance to the pleurocystidia. The [[hypha]]e of ''G.&nbsp;sulciceps'' have [[clamp connection]]s—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of [[cell nucleus|nuclear]] division.<ref name=Smith1963/>

==Biochemistry==

''Galerina sulciceps'' is deadly poisonous; one author opines it to be "perhaps the most toxic mushroom known to man",<ref name=Ammirati1981/> while later studies of toxin concentrations in amanitin-containing mushrooms corroborate this view.<ref name=Enjalbert2004/><ref name=Klan1993/> The symptoms of poisoning attributed to the mushroom have been noted to be relatively unusual: a local anesthesic effect, "pins and needles" sensation, and nausea without vomiting.<ref name=Smith1963/> Although these clinical symptoms are inconsistent with those of [[amatoxin]] poisoning, the presence of [[alpha-amanitin|α-]], [[beta-amanitin|β-]] and [[gamma-amanitin|γ-]] amanitins in this species has been verified with [[chromatography|chromatographic analysis]].<ref name=Besl1981/><ref name=Besl1984/> Amatoxins damage the [[liver]] and [[kidney]] by binding irreversibly to [[RNA polymerase II]].<ref name=Enjalbert2002/> Three separate instances of poisoning in Indonesia involved 18 people, 14 of which died.<ref name=Boedijn1938/> Based on this set of occurrences, death occurs in 7–51 hours "unless the patient survives, which seems to depend on the quantity eaten and the vigor of the individual."<ref name=Smith1963/> Another death attributed to this mushroom was reported in Germany in the early 1980s.<ref name=Chapuis1982/> Severe poisonings have been treated with complete blood [[Kidney dialysis|dialysis]] or [[liver transplant]]s.<ref name=Hall2003/>

==Habitat and distribution==
This species grows on dead wood in tropical locales like Indonesia ([[Java]] and [[Sumatra]]), and near India ([[Sri Lanka]]), where it is prolific in some areas.<ref name=Smith1963/> It is not found in North America.<ref name=Beuchat1987/> In Germany, it has been found growing in greenhouses, and is known in the [[common name|vernacular]] as the ''Gewächshaus-Häubling'', meaning "greenhouse Galerina".<ref name=Rebmann2007/> In one instance, the mushroom was discovered fruiting in dense groups in pots of [[orchid]]s standing on moist [[conifer]] sawdust.<ref name=Bresinsky1989/>
