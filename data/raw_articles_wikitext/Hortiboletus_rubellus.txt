'''''Hortiboletus rubellus''''', commonly known as the '''ruby bolete''', is a small, dainty, brightly coloured member of the family [[Boletaceae]], with a reddish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and yellow pores. Like many [[bolete]]s, it stains blue when cut or bruised. It is found in [[deciduous]] woodland in autumn. There is some question over its edibility, and it is reportedly of poor quality with a taste of soap. Until 2015, the species was known as '''''Boletus rubellus'''''.

==Taxonomy==
''Boletus rubellus'' was one of the pored basidiomycetes to be placed in the genus ''[[Xerocomus]]'' in the past, and is still regarded as such in some texts.<ref name=Lamaison05>{{cite book |title=The Great Encyclopedia of Mushrooms |last=Lamaison |first=Jean-Louis |author2=Polese, Jean-Marie |year=2005 |publisher=Könemann |isbn=3-8331-1239-5|page=25}}</ref> The previously commonly used binomial name ''Boletus versicolor'' (Rostk.), published in 1844, is now reduced to synonymy as it postdates the current name by German mycologist [[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz]] which dates from 1836. Its present specific epithet ''{{lang|la|rubellus}}'' is [[Latin]] for "somewhat red".<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|pages = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref> The fungus was transferred to the new genus ''[[Hortiboletus]]'' in 2015,<ref name="Vizzini 2015"/> following [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] evidence indicating its  genetic dissimilarity to ''Boletus''.<ref name="Nuhn 2013"/><ref name="Wu 2014"/>

==Description==
It is a small [[bolete]], with the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] being rarely over {{convert|6|cm|in|frac=8}} in diameter. This cap is scarlet to raspberry red when young, with a dry velvety texture,<ref name="Phillips06" /> often cracking in age.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=218}}</ref> The extreme margin often has a pale yellow or white band around it, and it discolours darker and dirtier with age.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|pages=282}}</ref> The pores are small; pale yellow,<ref name = "MarcelBon87">{{cite book | author = Marcel Bon | year = 1987 | title = The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North Western Europe | publisher = Hodder and Stoughton | isbn = 0-340-39935-X}}</ref> and bruise slowly. Sometimes tapering, the [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is slender and long, and may reach {{convert|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=8}}. It is lemon yellow at the apex, but red elsewhere, and has a tendency to split or sheer vertically. The flesh is straw-coloured in the cap, and stains slowly blue over the tubes when cut. The flesh of the stem is pale yellow at the apex and yellow further down. At the stem base, the flesh may have a distinct spot of brick-red or orange.<ref name=grzyby>{{cite web | title=''Xerocomus rubellus'' at grzyby.pl | publisher=Grzyby.pl | url=http://www.grzyby.pl/gatunki/Xerocomus_rubellus.htm | access-date=July 20, 2009 }}</ref> The tubes and pores are large and lemon-yellow, and may be greenish tinged when older. The [[spore print]] is olive.<ref name=Phillips06/> It smells pleasant, but indistinct, and is said to taste slightly soapy.<ref name=Phillips06/>

Conflicting information on pore size in notable publications is a possible indication that there may be more than one species involved, both in Britain and in North America.<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
Uncommon to rare in [[Southern England]], occurring largely with oak (''[[Quercus]]''). It also appears in Europe, and the Eastern United States and Canada. <ref name=Phillips06/> A similar species noted as "cf versicolor" has been collected from Victoria in southeastern Australia.<ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Watling R, Hui LT |title=Australian Boletes - A Preliminary Survey|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh|location=Edinburgh|year=1999|pages=42|isbn=1-872291-28-7}}</ref>

==Edibility==
The species is edible, but often maggoty, and some sources describe the taste as soapy.<ref name=Phillips06/>

==Similar species==
''[[Baorangia bicolor]]'' is almost identical,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kuo|first=Michael|date=January 2015|title=Boletus bicolor|url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/boletus_bicolor.html|access-date=2021-10-20|website=MushroomExpert.Com}}</ref> and ''Boletus campestris'' is very similar.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kuo|first=Michael|date=December 2014|title=Boletus campestris|url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/boletus_campestris.html|access-date=2021-10-20|website=MushroomExpert.Com}}</ref> 

In Europe, this species is often mistaken for the similar ''Xerocomus armeniacus'' due to similar dry and velvety pileus, but does not show the same red coloration in the stem base.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Frank |first=J.L. |last2=Siegel |first2=N. |last3=Schwarz |first3=C.F. |last4=Araki |first4=B. |last5=Vellinga |first5=E.C. |date=2020-12-15 |title=Xerocomellus ( Boletaceae ) in western North America |url=https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/10.3114/fuse.2020.06.13 |journal=Fungal Systematics and Evolution |language=en |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=265–288 |doi=10.3114/fuse.2020.06.13 |issn=2589-3823 |pmc=7453129 |pmid=32904489 |access-date=2025-10-18}}</ref> Other similar species include ''[[Xerocomellus chrysenteron]]'', ''X. mendocinensis'', ''[[Hortiboletus coccyginus]]'', and ''Boletus fraternus''.<ref name=":0" />
