'''''Russula integra''''', [[common name|commonly known]] as the '''entire russula''', is a [[species]] of [[mushroom]]. The fungus stems from the huge genus of ''[[Russula]]''. It is found in [[conifer]] forests across Europe and throughout North America.

The fruiting body is mildly flavoured with a slight cashew-like taste and dense flesh. It is edible when cooked thoroughly and is popular in parts of Europe.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is almost shaped like a sphere at first, and soon becomes flattened or depressed; it is {{Convert|6-12|cm|abbr=on}} broad.<ref name="museum">{{cite book|last=New York State Museum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ncVAAAAYAAJ&q=russula+integra&pg=RA2-PA93|title=Bulletin of the New York State Museum, Issues 112-117|publisher=The University|year=1907|pages=93}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

=== Similar species ===
''[[Russula mustelina]]'' is similar, with a brown cap, white stalk, yellow spores, and firm flesh.<ref name=":0" />

==Habitat and distribution==
The species is widely distributed and can commonly be found scattered under [[conifer]]s.<ref name="comprehensive"/> It can commonly be found in [[spruce]] forests or [[fir]] forests in the mountains.<ref name="Great"/> The species is rare in [[New York (state)|New York]] and can be found there in August.<ref name="museum" />
==Edibility==
The species has a crunchy [[Surface texture|texture]] and tastes nutty. It is popular to eat in [[Northern Europe|Northern]]<ref name="Great"/> and [[Central Europe]]. In [[Romanian language|Romanian]], the mushroom is called ''pâinişoară'' ("little bread") due to its edibility and perceived taste and texture.<ref>[http://dexonline.ro/search.php?lexemId=40420 DEX Online]</ref> According to [[David Arora]], the species is good when it is young. There are similar-looking species with unknown edibility.<ref name="comprehensive"/>

According to an 1878 study, [[Mushroom poisoning|poisoning]] from this species used to be frequent, but is now rare. The study concluded that long cooking gets rid of its toxic properties, but that rapid culinary processes such as roasting do not.<ref>{{cite book | last = Multiple authors | title = Cyclopædia of the practice of medicine, Volume 17 | publisher = W.
