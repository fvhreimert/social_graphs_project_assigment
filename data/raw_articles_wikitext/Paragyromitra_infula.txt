'''''Paragyromitra infula''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''hooded false morel''' or the '''elfin saddle''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Discinaceae]]. The dark reddish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of the [[sporocarp (fungus)|fruit bodies]] develop a characteristic saddle-shape in maturity, and the ends of both saddle lobes are drawn out to sharp tips that project above the level of the fruit body. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white or flushed pale brown, smooth on the outside, but hollow with some chambers inside.

''P.&nbsp;infula'' is found in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], usually in the late summer and autumn, growing on rotting wood or on hard packed ground. The species has been considered [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]], believed to contain the toxic compound [[gyromitrin]], but a 2023 study has thrown this into doubt.

==Taxonomy==

The fungus was first [[species description|described]] in 1774 by the German mycologist [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] as ''Helvella infula'' (the original genus spelling was ''Elvela'').<ref name="Schaeffer1774" /> In 1849, [[Elias Magnus Fries]] established the genus ''[[Gyromitra]]'', distinguishing it from ''[[Helvella]]'' based on a gyrose [[hymenium]] (marked with wavy lines or convolutions); the genus was based on the [[type species]] ''[[Gyromitra esculenta|G.&nbsp;esculenta]]''.<ref name="Fries1849" />  Later, in 1886, the French mycologist [[Lucien Quélet]] transferred the species to ''Gyromitra''. The next few decades witnessed some lingering confusion as to the correct [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] placement of these fungi.

In 1907, [[Jean Louis Émile Boudier|Jean Boudier]] moved both ''G.&nbsp;esculenta'' and ''H.&nbsp;infula'' into a newly created genus he called ''Physomitra''; he retained the genus ''Gyromitra'' but "based it on an entirely different character so as to exclude from the genus the very species on which it was founded".<ref name="Seaver1920" /> In an attempt to reconcile the confusion surrounding the naming and identity of the two mushrooms, [[Fred J. Seaver]] proposed that both were [[synonym (biology)|synonymous]], representing variable forms of the same species.<ref name="Seaver1920" /> His suggestion was not adopted by later mycologists, who identified various differences between the two species, including fruiting time as well as macroscopic and microscopic differences.<ref name="Kanouse1948" /><ref name="Groves1953" /> The species is now classified in the newly erected genus ''[[Paragyromitra]]''.

===Etymology===
The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is from the [[Latin]] ''infǔla'', a heavy band of twisted wool worn by Roman officiants at sacrifices.<ref name="Simpson1979" /> It is known more commonly as the elfin saddle<ref name="urlGyromitra infula & Gyromitra ambigua (MushroomExpert.Com)" /> or the hooded false morel.<ref name="Evenson1997" /> Additionally, ''P.&nbsp;infula'' is a member of a group of fungi collectively known as "[[false morel]]s", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded edible [[Morel|true morels]] of the genus ''[[Morchella]]''. This group includes species such as ''[[Gyromitra esculenta]]'' (brain mushroom), ''[[Discina caroliniana]]'' (beefsteak mushroom) and ''[[Discina  gigas]]'' (snow morel).

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the fruit body (technically an [[apothecium]]) is about {{Convert|2.5-9|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} wide and tall, reddish to orangish brown, and saddle-shaped<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=32}}</ref> with 2–4 lobes. It is chambered or hollow within<ref name=":0" /> and frequently develops blackish-brown spots on the surface. During the mushroom's development, the cap's periphery grows into the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] below to form a hollow, roughly bell-shaped structure with the fertile spore-bearing surface (the [[hymenium]]) on the outside; as the surface growth of the hymenium continues to expand even after joining to the stipe, the hymenium can no longer follow and it arches up into folds and pads.<ref name=Gaumann1928/>

The mostly hollow stipe is between {{convert|2–8|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} high and {{convert|1–2.5|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick, varying in color from reddish brown<ref name=":0" /> to whitish or even bluish, but is typically lighter than the cap.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Gyromitra infula" /> The stipe is minutely [[tomentose]] – covered with a layer of very fine hairs. The [[Trama (mycology)|context]] (flesh) is 1–2 millimetres thick, brittle,<ref name="Wells1968" /> and whitish to brownish.<ref name=":0" /> It lacks a notable odor or taste.



[[Ascospore]]s are [[ellipsoid]]al in shape, [[hyaline]], smooth, thin-walled, with dimensions of 17–22 by 7–9&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name=Tylutki1979/> They are also biguttulate, containing two large oil droplets at either end. The spore-producing cells, the [[Ascus|asci]], are roughly cylindrical, eight-spored, operculate (opening by an apical lid to discharge the spores) and have dimensions of 200–350 by 12–17&nbsp;|μm.<ref name="Wells1968" /> The diameter of the club-shaped [[paraphyses]] is 7–10&nbsp;μm at the apex.

===Similar species===

''Gyromitra esculenta'' has a wrinkled surface (similar to brainlike convolutions), not wavy or bumpy like ''P.&nbsp;infula''. ''[[Paragyromitra ambigua]]'' is very similar in appearance, and although it is usually not possible to discern between the two species without examining microscopic characteristics,<ref name=Kempton1973/> ''P.&nbsp;ambigua'' is said to have more pronounced purple tints in the stipe<ref name=Smith1980/> and has larger spores (about 22–30&nbsp;μm long).<ref name=Trudell2009/> ''[[Discina brunnea]]'' is more stout with a white stem, with a wrinkled cap which usually lacks points.<ref name=":0" />

The saddle-shaped cap of ''P.&nbsp;infula'' might also lead to confusion with some species of the genus ''Helvella'', but these latter fungi typically have grayer colors and thinner, fluted stipes (e.g. ''[[Helvella maculata|H.&nbsp;maculata]]'' which has distinctly white flesh).<ref name=":0" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
]]

''P. infula'' is widely distributed throughout [[taiga|boreal]], [[montane]] and coastal forests in North America.<ref name="Groves1954" /> The North American range extends north to Canada<ref name="Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991" /> and south to Mexico.<ref name="Medel2005" /> It has also been reported from South America,<ref name="Kew1970" /> Europe,<ref name="Harmaja1969" /> and Asia.<ref name="Korf1991" />

The fungus can be found growing singly to scattered in or near [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous woodland]] in autumn, often on rotten wood.<ref name="Persson1978" /><ref name="Arora1986" /> It is also commonly found on packed ground, such as beside country roads, or in campgrounds.<ref name="Smith1975" /> Associated [[conifer]]s include ''[[Picea glauca]]'', ''[[Picea mariana|P.&nbsp;mariana]]'', ''[[Picea sitchensis|P.&nbsp;sitchensis]]'', ''[[Pinus contorta]]'', ''[[Pinus banksiana|P.&nbsp;banksiana]]'', ''[[Pinus monticola|P.&nbsp;monticola]]'', ''[[Abies balsamea]]'', ''[[Abies grandis|A.&nbsp;grandis]]'', ''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'', ''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'', ''[[Larix occidentalis]]'', ''[[Thuja plicata]]'', as well as the deciduous tree species ''[[Populus balsamifera]]'', ''[[Populus tremuloides|P.&nbsp;tremuloides]]'', ''[[Acer macrophyllum]]'', ''[[Alnus]]'' species, and ''[[Betula papyrifera]]''.<ref name="Abbott1992" />

==Toxicity==
This fungus has been widely regarded as poisonous, as it was long believed to contain the toxic compound [[gyromitrin]],<ref name="Tylutki1979" /> present in some species of ''Gyromitra'', which when digested is metabolized into [[monomethylhydrazine]], a major component of [[rocket fuel]].<ref name="urlwww.uaf.edu" /> However, a 2023 study found no traces of gyromitrin in ''G.&nbsp;infula'' (now called ''Paragyromitra infula'') using a new [[chromatography]] method.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Dirks |first1=Alden C. |last2=Mohamed |first2=Osama G. |last3=Schultz |first3=Pamela J. |last4=Miller |first4=Andrew N. |last5=Tripathi |first5=Ashootosh |last6=James |first6=Timothy Y. |date=2023-01-02 |title=Not all bad: Gyromitrin has a limited distribution in the false morels as determined by a new ultra high-performance liquid chromatography method |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00275514.2022.2146473 |journal=Mycologia |language=en |volume=115 |issue=1 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1080/00275514.2022.2146473 |pmid=36541902 |issn=0027-5514|url-access=subscription }}</ref>
