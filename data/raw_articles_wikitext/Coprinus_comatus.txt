'''''Coprinus comatus''''', commonly known as the '''shaggy ink cap''', '''lawyer's wig''', or '''shaggy mane''', is a species of [[fungus]]. The young [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] first appear as white cylinders emerging from the ground, then the bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] open out. The white caps are covered with scales, the origin of its [[common name]]s. The [[lamella (mycology)|gill]]s beneath the cap are white, then pink, then turn black. This mushroom is unusual because it will turn black and dissolve itself in a matter of hours after being picked or depositing spores.

The mushroom is often seen growing about lawns, gravel roads, and waste areas in the Northern Hemisphere and more locally in the Southern Hemisphere.<ref>Fungal Red List: [https://redlist.info/iucn/species_view/148667 ''Coprinus comatus'' (O.F. Müll.) Pers.]</ref> When young it is an excellent [[edible mushroom]] but it spoils quickly and resembles some [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species.

==Taxonomy==
The shaggy ink cap was first described by Danish naturalist [[Otto Friedrich Müller]] in 1780 as ''Agaricus comatus'', before being given its current binomial name in 1797 by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]]. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] derives from ''coma'', or "hair", hence ''comatus'', "hairy" or "shaggy".<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=72}}</ref>  Other common names include lawyer's wig,<ref name=Nilper/> and shaggy mane.

''Coprinus comatus'' is the type species for the genus ''[[Coprinus]]''. This genus was formerly considered to be a large one with well over 100 species. However, molecular analysis of DNA sequences showed that the former species belonged in two families, the [[Agaricaceae]] and the [[Psathyrellaceae]].<ref name="Red01">{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/1224525|last1=Redhead |first1=Scott A. |last2=Vilgalys |first2=Rytas |last3=Moncalvo |first3=Jean-Marc |last4=Johnson |first4=Jacqui |last5=Hopple Jr. |first5=John S |date=February 2001 |title=''Coprinus'' Pers. and the disposition of ''Coprinus'' species ''sensu lato''|jstor=1224525|journal=Taxon|volume=50|issue=1|pages=203–41}}</ref> ''Coprinus comatus'' is the best known of the true ''Coprinus''.

==Description==
The shaggy ink cap is easily recognizable from its almost cylindrical cap which initially covers most of its stem.

The mushroom can sometimes be confused with the [[Coprinopsis picacea|magpie fungus]] which is poisonous. In America, the 'vomiter' mushroom ''[[Chlorophyllum molybdites]]'' is responsible for most cases of mushroom poisoning due to its similarity with shaggy mane and other edible mushrooms.<ref name="poisonoverview">Beug, Michael W.

==Distribution, habitat and ecology==
It grows in groups in places which are often unexpected, such as green areas in towns. It occurs widely in grasslands and meadows in North America<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |page=561}}</ref> and Europe, from June through to November in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=March 2025}} It appears to have been introduced to Australia, New Zealand and Iceland.
