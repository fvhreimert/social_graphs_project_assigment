'''''Caloboletus radicans''''', also known as the '''rooting bolete''' or '''whitish bolete''', is a large [[ectomycorrhizal]] [[fungus]] found in [[Europe]] under [[broad-leaved tree]]s, fruiting during the summer and autumn months. It has a pale buff or greyish-white [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], yellow pores and a stout [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and stains intensely blue when handled or cut. Bitter and inedible, it can cause severe vomiting and diarrhoea if eaten. Until 2014 it was placed in genus ''[[Boletus]]'', but has since been transferred to the new genus ''[[Caloboletus]]'' based on [[molecular]] [[phylogenetic]] data.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was first described by the pioneering South African-born mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801, who placed it in genus ''[[Boletus]]''. Its specific epithet is derived from the [[Latin]] ''radic-'' 'root', referring to its rooting [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. The name ''Boletus albidus'' is a later synonym.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Phillips R | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms |page= 278 | publisher = Pan MacMillan|location=London | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref> In 2014, the bolete was transferred to the new genus ''[[Caloboletus]]'' by Italian mycologist Alfredo Vizzini, based on [[phylogenetic]] data.<ref name="Vizzini 2014"/>

It is often known by the common name of ''whitish bolete''.<ref name=Lamaison05>{{cite book |title=The Great Encyclopedia of Mushrooms |last=Lamaison |first=Jean-Louis |author2=Polese, Jean-Marie |year=2005 |publisher=Könemann |isbn=3-8331-1239-5|pages=33}}</ref>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] diameter ranges from {{convert|7.5| to |30|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} across, and is usually dirty white, greyish-white, ivory white or buff, downy at first, but often finely cracking at the centre as the cap expands. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{cvt|5|-|8|cm|1}} tall by {{cvt|3|-|4|cm}}  wide, usually swollen or barrel-shaped when young, but soon becoming elongated and more or less fusiform, with a tapering base usually rooting into the substrate. The apex is typically bright lemon yellow, but fading below. There is a light straw-coloured reticulation at the upper part of the stipe, though in rare occasions this may be indistinct. The flesh is pale yellow, somewhat paler whitish to straw-coloured in the cap, instantly turning dark blue when cut. The pores are lemon yellow, small and rounded, bruising blue when touched or injured. The [[spore print]] is olivaceous walnut-brown.<ref name=Phillips06/><ref name="Courtecuisse 1995"/><ref name="Munoz 2005"/><ref>Bon M. (1987).The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North Western Europe.</ref>

Microscopically, it has ellipsoid to fusiform spores measuring 11.5–14 × 4–5.5 μm. The hyphal structure of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is a trichodermium of interwoven septate [[hyphae]], often finely incrusted.<ref name="Breitenbach 1991"/><ref name="Galli 2007"/><ref name="Munoz 2005"/><ref name="Watling 2005"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
Fruiting during warm spells in the summer and early autumn, ''Caloboletus radicans'' is ecologically versatile. It forms [[ectomycorrhizal]] associations with a wide range of [[broad-leaved tree]]s, including oaks (''[[Quercus]]''), beech (''[[Beech|Fagus]]''), hornbeam (''[[Carpinus]]''), chestnut (''[[Castanea (plant)|Castanea]]'') and lime (''[[Tilia]]'').<ref name="Galli 2007"/><ref name="Loizides 2019"/> It grows on both [[calcareous]] (chalk) and acidic soils in southern England (where it is common) and across much of [[Europe]].<ref name=Phillips06/><ref name="Munoz 2005"/>

==Edibility==
The mushroom is inedible due to its intense bitterness.<ref name=Phillips06/> A 2012 study on mushroom poisoning in Switzerland by Katharina M. Schenk-Jaeger and colleagues, found ''Caloboletus radicans'' to have caused severe gastrointestinal symptoms to those who had consumed it, including recurrent vomiting and bloody diarrhoea.<ref name=SchenkJaeger>{{cite journal|vauthors=Schenk-Jaeger KM, Rauber-Lüthy C, Bodmer M, Kupferschmidt H, Kullak-Ublick GA, Ceschi A |date=2012|title=Mushroom poisoning: a study on circumstances of exposure and patterns of toxicity|journal=European Journal of Internal Medicine|volume=23|issue=4|pages=e85–e91|doi=10.1016/j.ejim.2012.03.014|pmid=22560399}}</ref>
