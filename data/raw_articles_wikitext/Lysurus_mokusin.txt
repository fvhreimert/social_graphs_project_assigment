'''''Lysurus mokusin''''', commonly known as the '''lantern stinkhorn''', the '''small lizard's claw''', or the '''ribbed lizard claw''', is a [[saprobic]] species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Phallaceae]]. The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] consists of a reddish, cylindrical fluted [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] that is capped with several "arms". The arms can approach or even close in on each other to form a [[spire]]. The [[gleba]]—an olive-green slimy [[spore]] mass—is carried on the outer surface of the arms. The fruit body has an odor comparable to "fresh dog feces", "rotting flesh", or "sewage" when mature.

The fungus is native to Asia, and is also found in Australia, Europe and North America, where it is probably an [[introduced species]]. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]] in its immature "egg" stage and has been used [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicinally]] in China as an [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]] remedy.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by the Catholic Priest and missionary [[Pierre-Martial Cibot]] in 1775, after he found it near [[Peking]] (now Beijing).<ref name="Cibot1775" /> This finding represents the earliest published scientific record of a fungus from China.<ref name="Bo1980" /> Cibot's [[basionym|original name]] for the lantern stinkhorn, ''Phallus mokusin'', was [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in his 1801 ''[[Synopsis Methodica Fungorum]]''.<ref name="Persoon1801" /> In 1823, [[Elias Magnus Fries]]  transferred it to the genus ''[[Lysurus (fungus)|Lysurus]]'' in his ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]''.<ref name="Fries1823" /> ''L.&nbsp;mokusin'' is the [[type species]] of the genus ''Lysurus''.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Lysurus" />

In 1938, Y.&nbsp;Kobayasi reported the [[form (botany)|form]] ''L.&nbsp;mokusin'' f. ''sinensis'', which he said differed from the main species in having a head that was more angular and conical at the top;<ref name=Kobayasi1938/> the form ''sinensis'' was also reported in Korea in 1995.<ref name=Seok1995/> Some authors have attempted to define forms of ''L.&nbsp;mokusin'' as new species based on the degree of separation of the apical arms. For example, to contrast with his concept of ''Lysurus'' in which the arms were either free or slightly fused, the genus ''Lloydia'' was created by Chow in 1935 to contain species in which the tips of the arms were fused. As a result of various differing interpretations of the limits of ''L.&nbsp;mokusin'', and the desire of some authors to define new species based on perceived differences, the fungus has acquired a lengthy list of [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] over the years.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Lysurus mokusin"/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "lantern stinkhorn", the "small lizard's claw",<ref name="urlwww.mushroomhunter.net" /> or the "ribbed lizard claw".<ref name="McKnight1987" />

''Lysuris mokusin'' has been included in a large-scale [[phylogenetic]] analysis of [[Gomphales|Gomphoid]] and [[Phallales|Phalloid]] fungi published in 2006, and was shown to form a [[clade]] with ''[[Simblum sphaerocephalum]]'', ''[[Lysurus borealis]]'', and ''[[Protubera clathroidea]]''.<ref name=Hosaka2006/>

==Description==
Immature fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;mokusin'' are white, gelatinous "eggs" measuring {{convert|1|–|3|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter, and are attached to the ground by thickened strands of [[mycelium]] called [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]]s. As the fungus matures, the egg ruptures as the fruit body rapidly expands, leaving [[volva (mycology)|volval]] remnants behind at the base. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] of the hollow, spongy mature fruiting body has dimensions of {{convert|10|–|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} by {{convert|1.5|–|2.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}, and ranges in color from white to pink to red, with 4–6 distinct deeply grooved sides divided lengthwise by ribs. The basis of distinction between ''L.&nbsp;mokusin'' and other species of ''Lysurus'' is the angular form of its stipe.<ref name=Beltran1998/> The sides branch out into 4–6 arms that are fused together at the tip to form a pointed apex, resembling a [[spire]]. As the mushroom matures, the arms may spread apart. The outer surface of the arms is coated by a brownish, slimy, foul-smelling [[spore]] mass called the [[gleba]]; its [[wikt:fetid|fetid]] odor helps it attract flies and other insects to assist in [[spore dispersal]]. The odor has been compared to "fresh dog feces",<ref name="urlwaynesword.palomar.edu"/> "rotting flesh"<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Lysurus mokusin"/> or sewage.<ref name=Smith2005/>

The spores are cylindrical in shape, smooth, thin-walled, and [[hyaline]] (translucent), with dimensions of 4–6 by 2–2.5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name=Smith2005/> [[Scanning electron microscopy]] reveals that one end of the spores has a [[Hilum (biology)|hilar]] scar—an indentation in the spore wall that results during its separation from the [[sterigma]] of the basidium.<ref name=Burk1982/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are usually eight-spored, and the gleba composed of chains of roughly spherical, fusiform, [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to broadly club-shaped cells that are either 6.5–7.4 by 2.8–5.6&nbsp;μm or 37.1–46.3 by 18–28&nbsp;μm and also mixed with [[wikt:filamentous|filamentous]] cells 2.3–4.5&nbsp;μm wide. The [[hypha]]e of ''L.&nbsp;mokusin'' have [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name=Seok1995/>

===Similar species===
''[[Lysurus cruciatus]]'' is similar is appearance to ''L.&nbsp;mokusin'', but has a cylindrical stem without any flutings at the tip. ''[[Lysurus borealis]]'' is also similar, but its stipe is not fluted, and without the angles present in ''L.&nbsp;mokusin''.<ref name=Miller2006/> ''[[Lysurus periphragmoides]]'' is cylindrical with a roundish lattice on top.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=118}}</ref>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Lysurus mokusin'' is [[saprobic]] growing solitarily or in small groups in [[forest litter]] and [[Woodchips|wood chip]] mulch used in [[landscaping]] as well as [[compost]].<ref name="Smith2005" /> Documented sightings of ''L.&nbsp;mokusin'' include [[Australasia]],<ref name="Cunningham1931" /> the [[Canary Islands]],<ref name="Beltran1998" /> [[Korea]],<ref name="Seok1995" /> [[Japan]],<ref name="Dring1980" /> China ([[Fujian Province]]),<ref name="Huang1985" /> and the [[Bonin Islands]].<ref name="Hongo1978" /> The species was unknown in Europe until it was reported in Italy in 1979;<ref name="Nonis1979" /> it is considered an [[alien species]] on that continent.<ref name="DAISIE2009" /> In the United States, it has been collected from the states of [[California]],<ref name="Cooke1961" /> [[Texas]], Northeast [[Oklahoma]] and [[Washington DC|Washington, D.C.]]<ref name="urlLysurus mokusin: The Lantern Stinkhorn (MushroomExpert.Com)"/>

== Uses ==
This species is considered to be [[edible mushroom|edible]] when still in the immature "egg" stage and is a delicacy in China.<ref name="urlLysurus mokusin: The Lantern Stinkhorn (MushroomExpert.Com)" /> When mature, its foul odor would deter most individuals from attempting consumption.

The fungus has been used medicinally in China as a remedy for [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s.<ref name="Rolfe1974" /><ref name="Mao1987" />
