'''''Amanita muscaria''''', commonly known as the '''fly agaric''' or '''fly amanita''', is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus of the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. It is a large white-[[lamella (mycology)|gilled]], white-spotted mushroom  typically featuring a bright red cap covered with distinctive white warts. It is one of the most recognisable fungi in the world.

''A.{{nbs}}muscaria'' exhibits complex genetic diversity that suggests it is a species complex rather than a single species.<ref name=":1" /> It is a widely distributed mushroom native to temperate and boreal forests of the [[Northern Hemisphere]], now also naturalised in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], forming symbiotic relationships with various trees and spreading invasively in some regions.

Its name derives from its traditional use as an [[insecticide]]. It can cause poisoning, especially in children and those seeking its [[hallucinogen]]ic effects, due to psychoactive compounds like [[muscimol]] and the [[ibotenic acid]]; however, fatal poisonings are extremely rare. Boiling it reduces toxicity by removing water-soluble ibotenic acid into the discarded water. Drying converts ibotenic acid into muscimol, lowering toxicity but retaining psychoactive effects. Some cultures use it as food after preparation. [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous]] peoples of [[Siberia]] used ''A.{{nbs}}muscaria'' as an inebriant and [[entheogen]]. It has been controversially linked to [[Santa Claus]], Viking [[berserker]]s, [[Vedic]] [[Soma (drink)|soma]], and [[early Christianity]], though evidence is sparse and disputed. Its rise in the 2020s as a legal hallucinogen alternative has led to [[Food and Drug Administration]] scrutiny.<!--Per WP:CITELEAD, references are not needed in the lead if it is sourced in the body of the article.-->

''A.{{nbs}}muscaria'' has appeared in [[art]] and [[literature]] since the [[Renaissance]], becoming iconic in [[fairy tale]]s, [[children’s literature|children’s books]], and media like the [[Super Mario]] games and Disney’s [[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]].  It has also influenced literary depictions of altered perception—most notably in ''[[Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland]]''—and has been referenced in novels by writers including [[Oliver Goldsmith]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], and [[Alan Garner]].

==Taxonomy==
The name of the [[mushroom]] in many European languages is thought to derive from its use as an [[insecticide]] when sprinkled in milk. This practice has been recorded from [[Germanic languages|Germanic-]] <!--(bar England)--> and [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking]] parts of Europe, as well as the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] region and pockets elsewhere in France, and Romania.{{sfn|Wasson|1968|p=198}} [[Albertus Magnus]] was the first to record it in his work ''De vegetabilibus'' some time before 1256,<ref>{{cite book |title=De vegetabilibus |author=Magnus A.|author-link=Albertus Magnus |year=1256|chapter=Book&nbsp;II, Chapter 6; p. 87 and Book&nbsp;VI, Chapter 7; p. 345}}</ref> commenting ''"vocatur fungus muscarum, eo quod in lacte pulverizatus interficit muscas"'' ("it is called the fly mushroom because it is powdered in milk to kill flies").{{sfn|Ramsbottom|1989|p=44}}

The 16th-century Flemish botanist [[Carolus Clusius]] traced the practice of sprinkling it into milk to [[Frankfurt]] in Germany,<ref>{{cite book |title=Rariorum plantarum historia |author=Clusius C.|author-link=Carolus Clusius |year=1601|chapter=Genus&nbsp;XII of the pernicious mushrooms }}</ref> while [[Carl Linnaeus]], the "father of taxonomy", reported it from [[Småland]] in southern Sweden, where he had lived as a child.<ref>{{cite book | author =Linnaeus C.| author-link=Carl Linnaeus | title=Flora svecica [suecica] exhibens plantas per regnum Sueciae crescentes systematice cum differentiis specierum, synonymis autorum, nominibus incolarum, solo locorum, usu pharmacopæorum| publisher=Laurentii Salvii |location=Stockholm | year=1745|language=la}}</ref> He described it in volume two of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753, giving it the name ''Agaricus muscarius'',<ref>{{cite book | author=Linnaeus C | title=Species Plantarum| volume=2| publisher=Laurentii Salvii |location=Stockholm | year=1753|chapter= Tomus&nbsp;II | chapter-url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/359193| page=1172|language=la}}</ref> the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] deriving from [[Latin]] ''musca'' meaning "fly".<ref>{{cite book | author = Simpson DP | title = Cassell's Latin dictionary | publisher = Cassell Ltd. | year= 1979 | edition = 5th | location = London | page = 883 | isbn = 978-0-304-52257-6}}</ref> It gained its current name in 1783, when placed in the genus ''[[Amanita]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], a [[sanctioned name|name sanctioned]] in 1821 by the "father of mycology", Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. The starting date for all the [[mycota]] had been set by general agreement as January 1, 1821, the date of Fries's work, and so the full name was then ''Amanita muscaria'' (L.:Fr.) [[William Jackson Hooker|Hook]]. The 1987 edition of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered valid as far back as May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-662-10189-6_6 |chapter=The Naming of Fungi |title=Systematics and Evolution |date=2001 |last1=Hawksworth |first1=David L. |pages=171–192 |isbn=978-3-642-08576-5 |editor-last1=McLaughlin |editor-last2=McLaughlin |editor-last3=Lemke |editor-first1=David J. |editor-first2=Esther G. |editor-first3=Paul A. }}</ref> Hence, Linnaeus and Lamarck are now taken as the namers of ''Amanita muscaria'' (L.) Lam..

The English mycologist [[John Ramsbottom (mycologist)|John Ramsbottom]] reported that ''Amanita muscaria'' was used for getting rid of bugs in England and Sweden, and ''bug agaric'' was an old alternative name for the species.{{sfn|Ramsbottom|1989|p=44}} French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] reported having tried without success to replicate its fly-killing properties in his work ''{{lang|fr|Histoire des plantes vénéneuses et suspectes de la France}}'' (1784), and proposed a new binomial name ''Agaricus pseudo-aurantiacus'' because of this.{{sfn|Wasson|1968|p=200}} One compound isolated from the fungus is 1,3-diolein (1,3-di(cis-9-octadecenoyl)glycerol), which attracts insects.{{sfn|Benjamin|1995|pp=306–307}}
It has been hypothesised that the flies intentionally seek out the fly agaric for its intoxicating properties.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Animals and psychedelics: the natural world and the instinct to alter consciousness|first=Giorgio|last=Samorini|year=2002|publisher=Inner Traditions/Bear |isbn=978-0-89281-986-7|at=823/1251 (67%) in Kindle edition}}</ref>
An alternative derivation proposes that the term ''fly-'' refers not to insects as such but rather the [[delirium]] resulting from consumption of the fungus. This is based on the medieval belief that flies could enter a person's head and cause mental illness.<ref name = "Michelot03">{{cite journal |author=Michelot D |author2=Melendez-Howell LM. |s2cid=41451034 |title=''Amanita muscaria'': chemistry, biology, toxicology, and ethnomycology |journal=Mycological Research |volume=107 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=131–46 |year=2003 |pmid=12747324 |doi=10.1017/S0953756203007305}}</ref> Several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation, meaning the "mad" or "fool's" version of the highly regarded edible mushroom ''[[Amanita caesarea]]''.

==Description==


A large, conspicuous mushroom, ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' is generally common and numerous where it grows, and is often found in groups with [[basidiocarp]]s in all stages of development.
Fly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs. After emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the [[universal veil]], a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage reveals a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil, which helps identification. As the fungus grows, the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size, but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from [[wikt:globose|globose]] to hemispherical, and finally to plate-like and flat in mature specimens.<ref>{{cite book |author=Zeitlmayr L. |title=Wild mushrooms: an illustrated handbook |publisher=Hertfordshire, UK: Garden City Press |year=1976 |isbn=978-0-584-10324-3}}</ref> Fully grown, the bright red [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is usually around {{convert|8–20|cm|frac=2|abbr=off}} in diameter, although larger specimens have been found.

The free [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white, as is the [[spore print]]. The oval spores measure 9–13 by 6.5–9&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]; they do not turn blue with the application of [[Melzer's reagent|iodine]].{{sfn|Arora|1986|pp=282–83}} The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white, {{convert|5–20|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} high<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Sisson |first1=Liv |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/on1372569849 |title=Fungi of Aotearoa: a curious forager's field guide |last2=Vigus |first2=Paula |date=2023 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-1-76104-787-9 |location=Auckland, New Zealand |pages=210 |oclc=on1372569849}}</ref> by {{convert|1–2|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} wide, and has the slightly brittle, fibrous texture typical of many large mushrooms.

Between the basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of the [[partial veil]] (which covers the gills during development) in the form of a white [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. It can be quite wide and flaccid with age. There is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness.<ref name="Ultimatemush">{{cite book |author=Jordan P |title=The ultimate mushroom book |author2=Wheeler S. |publisher=Hermes House |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8317-3080-2}}</ref><ref name="Phillips06">{{cite book |author=Phillips R. |title=Mushrooms |publisher=Pan MacMillan |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-330-44237-4 |page=140}}</ref>



Although very distinctive in appearance, the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in the Americas, such as ''[[Armillaria]]'' cf.

=== Controversy ===


''Amanita muscaria'' varies considerably in its morphology, and many authorities recognise several subspecies or varieties within the species. In ''The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', German mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] listed three subspecies, though without description: ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' ssp. ''muscaria'', ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' ssp. ''americana'', and ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' ssp. ''flavivolvata''.<ref name=singer/>

However, a 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' by mycologist József Geml and colleagues found three distinct [[clade]]s within this species representing, roughly, Eurasian, Eurasian "subalpine", and North American populations. Specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in Alaska; this has led to the hypothesis that this was the centre of diversification for this species. The study also looked at four named varieties of the species: var. ''alba'', var. ''flavivolvata'', var. ''formosa'' (including var. ''guessowii''), and var. ''regalis'' from both areas. All four varieties were found within both the Eurasian and North American clades, evidence that these morphological forms are [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] rather than distinct subspecies or varieties.<ref name="Geml06">{{cite journal|author=Geml J |author2=Laursen GA |author3=O'Neill K |author4=Nusbaum HC |author5=Taylor DL |title=Beringian origins and cryptic speciation events in the fly agaric (''Amanita muscaria'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=225–39 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16367842 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02799.x |bibcode=2006MolEc..15..225G }}</ref> Further molecular study by Geml and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oak–hickory–pine forest in the southeastern United States and two more on [[Santa Cruz Island]] in California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species.

==Distribution and habitat==
, in [[California]]]]

''A. muscaria'' is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] mushroom, native to conifer and deciduous woodlands throughout the [[temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] regions of the Northern Hemisphere,<ref name = "Geml06"/> including higher elevations of warmer latitudes in regions such as [[Hindu Kush]], the Mediterranean and also Central America. A recent molecular study proposes that it had an ancestral origin in the [[Siberia]]n–[[Beringia]]n region in the [[Tertiary (period)|Tertiary]] period, before radiating outwards across Asia, Europe and North America.<ref name = "Geml06"/> The season for fruiting varies in different climates: fruiting occurs in summer and autumn across most of North America, but later in autumn and early winter on the [[Pacific coast]].

There is no antidote, and supportive care is the mainstay of further treatment for intoxication.

== Uses ==

===Psychoactive===


The wide range of [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] effects have been variously described as [[depressant]], [[sedative]]-[[hypnotic]], [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], [[dissociative]], or [[deliriant]]; [[Paradoxical reaction|paradoxical effect]]s such as [[Stimulant|stimulation]] may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as [[synesthesia]], [[macropsia]], and [[micropsia]] may occur; the latter two effects may occur either simultaneously or alternatingly, as part of [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]], collectively known as dysmetropsia, along with related distortions [[pelopsia]] and [[teleopsia]].

==== Siberia ====

''A. muscaria'' was widely used as an [[entheogen]] by many of the [[indigenous peoples of Siberia]]. Its use was known among almost all of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the [[Paleosiberian]]-speaking peoples of the [[Russian Far East]]. There are only isolated reports of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' use among the [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] and [[Turkic peoples]] of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' was not practised by these peoples.<ref name="nyberg1">{{cite journal |last1=Nyberg |first1=Harri |title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican cultures |journal=Karstenia |date=1992 |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=71–80 |doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294 }}</ref> In western Siberia, the use of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a [[trance]] state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously.<ref name="nyberg1" /> In eastern Siberia, the [[shamanism|shaman]] would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine.{{sfn|Wasson|1968|p=161}} This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.<ref name="Diaz">{{cite book|author=Diaz, J.|title=How Drugs Influence Behavior: A Neurobehavioral Approach|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|year=1996|isbn=978-0-02-328764-0 }}</ref>

The [[Koryaks|Koryak]] of eastern Siberia have a story about the fly agaric (''wapaq'') which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity ''Vahiyinin'' ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his [[spittle]] became the ''wapaq'', and his saliva becomes the warts. After experiencing the power of the ''wapaq'', Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it.{{sfn|Ramsbottom|1989|p=45}} Among the [[Koryaks]], one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.{{sfn|Wasson|1968|pp=234–235}} It was reported that the local reindeer would often follow an individual intoxicated by the muscimol mushroom, and if said individual were to urinate in snow the reindeer would become similarly intoxicated and the [[Koryaks|Koryak]] people's would use the drunken state of the reindeer to more easily rope and hunt them.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=MR |last2=Dukan |first2=E |last3=Milne |first3=I |title=Amanita Muscaria (Fly Agaric): From a Shamanistic Hallucinogen to the Search for Acetylcholine |journal=Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh |date=March 2018 |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=85–91 |doi=10.4997/jrcpe.2018.119 |pmid=29741535 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

As a result of a lack of regulation, the use of ''Amanita muscaria'' as a popular legal alternative to [[Hallucinogen|hallucinogens]] has grown exponentially in recent years. In 2024, [[Google Trends|Google]] searches for Amanita muscaria rose nearly 200% from the previous year, a trend that an article published in the ''[[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]]'' correlated with the sudden commercialisation of ''Amanita muscaria'' products on the internet.<ref name="Leas-2024">{{Cite journal |last=Leas |first=Eric |date=June 10, 2024 |title=Need for a Public Health Response to the Unregulated Sales of Amanita muscaria Mushrooms |journal=[[American Journal of Preventive Medicine]]|volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=458–463 |doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2024.05.006 |pmid=38864780 |pmc=11832274 }}</ref>

The Finnish historian [[T. I. Itkonen]] mentions that ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' was once used among the [[Sámi peoples]].

Mycophilosopher Martijn Benders has proposed a novel evolutionary theory involving ''Amanita muscaria''. In his book ''Amanita Muscaria – the Book of the Empress'', Benders argues that a precursor of ibotenic acid, a compound found in the mushroom, was present in ancient seaweed and played a significant role in the evolution of life. According to this hypothesis, the compound influenced the twitching movements of early aquatic organisms, leading to the development of behaviors such as jumping onto land—a crucial step in the evolution of terrestrial species.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.martijnbenders.nl/whats-inside-the-book/ |title=Amanita Muscaria – the Book of the Empress |last=Benders |first=Martijn |date=2024 |website=martijnbenders.nl |access-date=2025-01-08}}</ref>

===== Vikings =====
The notion that [[Viking]]s used ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' to produce their [[berserker]] rages was first suggested by the Swedish professor Samuel Ödmann in 1784.<ref>{{in lang|sv}} Ödmann S.

===== Soma =====
{{See also|Botanical identity of Soma-Haoma}}

In 1968, [[R. Gordon Wasson]] proposed that ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' was the ''[[Soma (drink)|soma]]'' talked about in the [[Rigveda]] of India,{{sfn|Wasson|1968|p=10}} a claim which received widespread publicity and popular support at the time.{{sfn|Letcher|2006|p=145}} He noted that descriptions of ''soma'' omitted any description of roots, stems or seeds, which suggested a mushroom,<ref>Wasson, ''Soma'', p. 18.</ref> and used the adjective ''hári'' "dazzling" or "flaming" which the author interprets as meaning red.{{sfn|Wasson|1968|pp=36–37}} One line described men urinating ''soma''; this recalled the practice of recycling urine in Siberia. Soma is mentioned as coming "from the mountains", which Wasson interpreted as the mushroom having been brought in with the Aryan migrants from the north.{{sfn|Wasson|1968|pp=22–24}} Indian scholars Santosh Kumar Dash and Sachinanda Padhy pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were prescribed, using as a source the ''[[Manusmṛti]]''.{{sfn|Letcher|2006|p=146}}
In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson's theory and noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brough |first1=John |title=Soma and Amanita muscaria |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies |date=June 1971 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=331–362 |doi=10.1017/S0041977X0012957X }}</ref> In his 1976 survey, ''Hallucinogens and Culture'', anthropologist Peter T. Furst evaluated the evidence for and against the identification of the fly agaric mushroom as the Vedic Soma, concluding cautiously in its favour.{{sfn|Furst|1976|pp=96–108}} Kevin Feeney and Trent Austin compared the references in the Vedas with the filtering mechanisms in the preparation of Amanita muscaria and published findings supporting the proposal that fly-agaric mushrooms could be a likely candidate for the sacrament.{{sfn|Feeney|2020|p={{pn|date=December 2024}}}} Other proposed candidates include ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'', ''[[Peganum harmala]]'',{{sfn|Flattery|Schwartz|1989|p={{pn|date=December 2024}}}} and ''[[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]].''

Philologist, archaeologist, and [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] scholar [[John Marco Allegro]] postulated that early Christian [[theology]] was derived from a fertility cult revolving around the [[entheogen]]ic consumption of ''A. muscaria'' in his 1970 book ''[[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]].''<ref>

King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro's theory in the 1970 book ''A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth''; he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in the [[Middle East]], even though cedars and pines are found there, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro. He concludes that if the theory were true, the use of the mushroom must have been "the best kept secret in the world" as it was so well concealed for two thousand years.<ref>{{cite book|author=King, J.

=== Fly trap ===
''Amanita muscaria'' is traditionally used for catching flies possibly due to its content of [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]], which lead to its common name "fly agaric". Recently, an analysis of nine different methods for preparing ''A. muscaria'' for catching flies in [[Slovenia]] have shown that the release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Lumpert |year=2016 |title=Catching flies with Amanita muscaria: traditional recipes from Slovenia and their efficacy in the extraction of ibotenic acid |journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume=187 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2016.04.009 |pmid=27063872}}</ref>

The German physician and naturalist [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]] wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician [[Félix Archimède Pouchet]] was a populariser and advocate of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' consumption, comparing it to [[manioc]], an important food source in tropical South America that must also be detoxified before consumption.<ref name="RubArora"/>

Use of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' by an [[African-American]] mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist [[Frederick Vernon Coville]]. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak.<ref>Coville, F. V. 1898. ''Observations on Recent Cases of Mushroom Poisoning in the District of Columbia''. United States Department of Agriculture, Division of Botany.

A 2008 paper by food historian William Rubel and mycologist David Arora gives a history of consumption of ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' as a food and describes detoxification methods. They advocate that ''Amanita muscaria'' be described in field guides as an edible mushroom, though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it. The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a reflection of [[cultural bias]], as several other popular edible species, notably [[morels]], are also toxic unless properly cooked.<ref name="RubArora"/>
