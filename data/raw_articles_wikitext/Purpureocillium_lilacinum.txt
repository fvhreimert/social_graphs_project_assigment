'''''Purpureocillium lilacinum''''' is a species of filamentous [[fungus]] in the family [[Ophiocordycipitaceae]].<ref name="Spatafora2015">{{cite journal|author=Spatafora|display-authors=etal|year=2015|title=New 1F1N Species Combinations in ''Ophiocordycipitaceae'' (''Hypocreales'')|journal=IMA Fungus|volume=6|issue=2|pages=357–362|doi=10.5598/imafungus.2015.06.02.07|pmid=26734546|pmc=4681259}}</ref> It has been isolated from a wide range of habitats, including cultivated and uncultivated [[soil]]s, [[forest]]s, [[grassland]], [[desert]]s, [[estuary|estuarine]] sediments and sewage sludge, and insects. It has also been found in [[nematode]] eggs, and occasionally from females of root-knot and cyst nematodes. In addition, it has frequently been detected in the [[rhizosphere]] of many crops. The species can grow at a wide range of temperatures – from {{convert|8|to|38|C|F}} for a few isolates, with optimal growth in the range {{cvt|26|to|30|C|F}}. It also has a wide [[pH]] tolerance and can grow on a variety of substrates.<ref name=Samson1974/><ref name=Anderson1995/> ''P.&nbsp;lilacinum'' has shown promising results for use as a [[Biological pest control|biocontrol agent]] to control the growth of destructive [[root-knot nematodes]].

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The species was originally described by American mycologist [[Charles Thom]] in 1910, under  than name ''Penicillium lilacinum''.<ref name=Thom1910/> Taxonomic synonyms include ''Penicillium amethystinum'' Wehmer and ''Spicaria rubidopurpurea'' Aoki.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Paecilomyces lilacinus"/> In 1974, Robert A. Samson transferred the species to ''[[Paecilomyces]]''.<ref name=Samson1974/> Publications in the 2000s (decade) indicated that the genus ''Paecilomyces'' was not [[monophyletic]],<ref name=Inglis2006/> and that close relatives were ''Paecilomyces nostocoides'', ''Isaria takamizusanensis'' and ''Nomuraea atypicola''.<ref name=Sung2007/> The new genus ''Purpureocillium'' was created to hold the taxon. The generic name refers to the purple conidia produced by the fungus.<ref name=LuangsArd2011>{{cite journal |vauthors=Luangsa-Ard J, Houbraken J, van Doorn T, Hong SB, Borman AM, Hywel-Jones NL, Samson RA |title=''Purpureocillium'', a new genus for the medically important ''Paecilomyces lilacinus'' |journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters |year=2011 |volume=321 |issue=2 |pages=141–9 |doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2011.02322.x |pmid=21631575|doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Description==
''Purpureocillium lilacinum'' forms a dense [[mycelium]] which gives rise to [[conidium|conidiophores]]. These bear [[phialides]] from the ends of which spores are formed in long chains. Spores germinate when suitable moisture and nutrients are available. Colonies on malt agar grow rather fast, attaining a diameter of 5–7&nbsp;cm within 14&nbsp;days at {{convert|25|C|F}}, consisting of a basal felt with a [[wikt:floccose|floccose]] overgrowth of aerial [[mycelium]]; at first white, but when sporulating changing to various shades of [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]. The reverse side is sometimes uncolored but usually in vinaceous shades. The vegetative [[hypha]]e are smooth-walled, [[hyaline]], and 2.5–4.0&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] wide. Conidiophores arising from submerged hyphae, 400–600&nbsp;μm in length, or arising from aerial hyphae and half as long. Phialides consisting of a swollen basal part, tapering into a thin distinct neck. [[Conidium|Conidia]] are in divergent chains, ellipsoid to [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] in shape, and smooth walled to slightly roughened. [[Chlamydospore]]s are absent.<ref name=Samson1974/>

==Life cycles==

''Purpureocillium lilacinum'' is highly adaptable in its life strategy: depending on the availability of nutrients in the surrounding microenvironments it may be [[Entomopathogenic fungus|entomopathogenic]],<ref name=Rombach1986/><ref name=Marti2006/><ref name=Fiedler2007/> [[mycoparasitic]],<ref name=Gupta1993/> [[saprophytic]],<ref name=TigranoMilani1995/> as well as [[Nematophagous fungus|nematophagous]].

==Human pathogenicity==
''Purpureocillium lilacinum'' is an infrequent cause of human disease.<ref name=Saberhagen1997/><ref name=Westenfeld1996/> Most reported cases involve patients with compromised [[immune system]]s, indwelling foreign devices, or [[intraocular lens]] implants.<ref name=ODay1977/><ref name=Pettit1980/> Research of the last decade suggests it may be an emerging pathogen of both immunocompromised<ref name=Safdar2002/> as well as immunocompetent adults.<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol9no9/02-0654.htm Carey J, D’Amico R, Sutton DA, Rinaldi MG. Paecilomyces lilacinus vaginitis in an immunocompetent patient. Emerg Infect Dis &#91;serial online&#93; 2003 Sep]</ref>
It is one of the most common species causing [[hyalohyphomycosis]] along with ''[[Paecilomyces variotii]]''.<ref name=LuangsArd2011/>

==Biocontrol agent==
'', shown here.]]
Plant-parasitic nematodes cause significant economic losses to a wide variety of crops. Chemical control is a widely used option for plant-parasitic nematode management. However, chemical nematicides are now being reappraised in respect of [[environmental hazard]], high costs, limited availability in many developing countries or their diminished effectiveness following repeated applications.

=== Control of plant-parasitic nematodes ===
''Purpureocillium lilacinum'' was first observed in association with nematode eggs in 1966<ref name=Lysek1966/> and the fungus was subsequently found parasitising the eggs of ''[[Meloidogyne incognita]]'' in [[Peru]].<ref name=Jatala1979/> It has now been isolated from many cyst and root-knot nematodes and from soil in many locations.<ref name="S1991">{{cite book| last =Stirling |first =GR | title =Biological Control of Plant Parasitic Nematodes |publisher =CABI Publishing | year =1991 | location =UK | pages =282 }}</ref><ref name=Stirling1991/> Several successful field trials using ''P.&nbsp;lilacinum'' against pest nematodes were conducted in Peru.<ref name=Jatala1979/> The Peruvian isolate was then sent to nematologists in 46 countries for testing, as part of the International Meloidogyne project, resulting in many more [[field trial]]s on a range of crops in many soil types and climates.<ref name=Jatala1986/> Field trials, glasshouse trials and in vitro testing of ''P.&nbsp;lilacinum'' continues and more isolates have been collected from soil, nematodes and occasionally from insects. Isolates vary in their pathogenicity to plant-parasitic nematodes. Some isolates are aggressive parasites while others, though morphologically indistinguishable, are less or non-pathogenic. Sometimes isolates that looked promising ''in vitro'' or in glasshouse trials have failed to provide control in the field.<ref name=Gomes1991/>

=== Enzymes ===
Many [[enzyme]]s produced by ''P. lilacinum'' have been studied. A basic [[serine protease]] with biological activity against ''[[Meloidogyne hapla]]'' eggs has been identified.<ref name=Bonants1995/> One strain of ''P.&nbsp;lilacinum'' has been shown to produce [[protease]]s and a [[chitinase]], enzymes that could weaken a nematode egg shell so as to enable a narrow infection peg to push through.<ref name=Khan2004/>

=== Egg infection ===
Before infecting a nematode egg, ''P.&nbsp;lilacinum'' flattens against the egg surface and becomes closely [[wikt:appressed|appressed]] to it. ''P.&nbsp;lilacinum'' produces simple [[appressoria]] anywhere on the nematode egg shell either after a few [[hyphae]] grow along the egg surface, or after a network of hyphae form on the egg. The presence of appressoria appears to indicate that the egg is, or is about to be, infected. In either case, the appressorium appears the same, as a simple swelling at the end of a [[hypha]], closely appressed to the eggshell. Adhesion between the appressorium and nematode egg surface must be strong enough to withstand the opposing force produced by the extending tip of a penetration hypha.<ref name=Money1998/> When the hypha has penetrated the egg, it rapidly destroys the juvenile within, before growing out of the now empty egg shell to produce [[conidiophores]] and to grow towards adjacent eggs.

==Mycotoxins==
Paecilotoxin is a mycotoxin isolated from the fungus.<ref name=Mikami1989/> Its significance is unknown. Khan et al. (2003) tested one strain of ''P. lilacinum'' for the production of paecilotoxin and were unable to show toxin production in that strain, suggesting that toxin synthesis may vary among isolates.<ref name=Khan2003/><ref name=Park2004/>
