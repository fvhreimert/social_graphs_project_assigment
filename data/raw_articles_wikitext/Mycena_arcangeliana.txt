'''''Mycena arcangeliana''''' ([[common name|commonly known]] as the '''angel's bonnet''' or the '''late-season bonnet''') is a species of [[Mycenaceae]] fungus. It has been known by a number of scientific names, and its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] is still somewhat disputed. It produces small [[mushroom]]s with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] varying in colour from whitish to a darker grey-brown, and [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] of an olive-greyish that fade with age. The mushrooms can be mistaken for the similar ''[[Mycena flavescens]]''. They have a mild taste, but a strong smell of [[iodoform]]; they are not [[edible mushroom|edible]]. The species grows on dead wood in autumn months, and can be found throughout Europe.

==Taxonomy, naming, and classification==
''Mycena arcangeliana'' was first [[species description|described]] by [[Giacomo Bresadola]] in 1904;<ref name="MB"/> the species was listed along with 41 others found in [[Pisa]], in an article by [[Egidio Barsali]] published in the ''Bollettino Della Societa Botanica Italiana'' (''Bulletin of the Botanical Society of Italy'').<ref name="microscopical"/> Authors Roger Phillips and Paul Sterry both describe the name ''Mycena oortiana'' as [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]];<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Sterry"/> ''M.&nbsp;oortiana'' was a name given by [[Frederich Hora]] in 1960 based on [[Robert Kühner]]'s 1938 name for the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''Mycena arcangeliana'' var. ''oortiana'', an [[Valid name (botany)|invalid name]].<ref name="IF"/><ref name="MB2"/> Phillips had earlier considered ''M. arcangeliana'' var. ''oortiana'' to be a synonym of ''M.&nbsp;oortiana'',<ref name="Phillips2"/> and [[MycoBank]] lists it as a synonym of [[Lucien Quélet]]'s ''Mycena olivascens''.<ref name="MB2"/> However, [[Index Fungorum]] lists both ''M. olivascens'' and Kühner's ''Mycena vitilis'' var. ''olivascens'' as synonyms of ''M.&nbsp;arcangeliana''.<ref name="IF"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''arcangeliana'' may be in honour of [[Giovanni Arcangeli]], who collected the species in the [[Orto botanico di Pisa]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Sylloge Fungorum XVII|last= Saccardo|first= Pier Andrea|author-link= Pier Andrea Saccardo|year= 1905|publisher= J.

Within the genus ''[[Mycena]]'', it is found in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Filipedes'', on account of the [[cystidium|cheilocystidia]] covered with evenly spaced, short cylindrical excrescences, and its size and occurrence on wood. It can be separated from the other members of the section on account of a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with yellowish to olive shades, [[Lamellae (mycology)|gills]] with pinkish hints and stems with vaguely violet colouration.<ref name="Aronsen"/>

==Description==

''Mycena arcangeliana'' [[mushroom]]s have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of between {{convert|1|and|5|cm|in|sigfig=1}} in diameter which are conical in shape in younger mushrooms, becoming bell-shaped with a broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] in older specimens.<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Sterry"/> The oldest mushrooms have caps which are almost completely flat.<ref name="Aronsen"/> The colouration varies from a whitish to a darker grey-brown, sometimes with tints of [[Olive (colour)#Olive|olive]] or yellow, and it has furrows on the typically translucent surface.<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Sterry"/> However, it is [[hygrophanous]], and dries to a much paler colour.<ref name="Sterry"/> The cylindrical [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures between {{convert|20|and|40|mm|in|sigfig=1}} in length, by {{convert|1|and|2|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in width. In young mushrooms, it is an olive-greyish colour, tinted with [[lilac (color)|lilac]], though it fades as the mushroom ages. The very top of the stem is a whitish colour, while the base is covered in white hairs.<ref name="Phillips"/><ref name="Sterry"/> It is smooth and silky in texture,<ref name="Sterry"/> and there is no [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]].<ref name="Jordan"/> The crowded [[Lamellae (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed, that is, connected to the stem by only part of their depth, and are white in colour, turning pinkish as the mushroom ages.<ref name="Phillips"/> The gill edges are somewhat toothed.<ref name="Sterry"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has a mild taste, but a strong smell of [[iodoform]].<ref name="Phillips"/> In the cap, it is white, while in the stem, it is grey.<ref name="Phillips"/> The mushrooms are not [[edible mushroom|edible]].<ref name="Jordan"/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
''Mycena arcangeliana'' mushrooms leave a whitish [[spore print]], while the [[spore]]s are shaped like apple seeds and [[Amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning that they stain a dark colour in [[Melzer's reagent]] or [[Lugol's solution]].<ref name="Phillips"/> The [[basidia]] are four-spored.<ref name="Jordan"/> They measure from between 7 and 8 [[micrometre]]s&nbsp;(μm) by 4.5 and 5&nbsp;μm. There are a large number of [[hyaline]] cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the edge of the gills) which are club-shaped or [[wikt:ovate|ovate]]. They have thin [[cell wall]]s, and are covered in grain-like warts.<ref name="Phillips"/> The pleurocystidia (the cystidia on the face of the gill) are similar in appearance.<ref name="Aronsen"/> The [[pileipellis]] is made up of wart-covered [[hyphae]] measuring between 2 and 4.5&nbsp;μm wide and up to 30&nbsp;μm long. The outermost layer of the stem is made up hyphae with short, cylindrical hairs. The hyphae have [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name="Aronsen"/>

===Similar species===
''Mycena arcangeliana'' is somewhat similar to the less common ''[[Mycena flavescens]]'', a species found in both [[hardwood]] and [[softwood]] forests on the [[forest floor|floor]] among [[leaf litter|leaf or needle litter]] or grassland. ''M. flavescens'' typically has a whiter cap and a smell reminiscent of [[radish]].<ref name="Sterry"/> ''[[Mycena peyerimhoffi|M. peyerimhoffi]]'', known from Algeria, has a similar cap colour to ''M. arcangeliana'', but has a yellow stem. ''[[Mycena limonia|M. limonia]]'', known from the Netherlands, has a lemon-yellow cap and stem and more gills.<ref name="Aronsen"/> Another species similar in appearance is ''[[Mycena metata|M. metata]]'', which has a sweet taste.<ref>{{cite book |title= Champignons: L'Encyclopédie|author1=Deconchat, Christian |author2=Polèse, Jean-Marie |year= 2002|publisher= Editions Artemis|language= French|isbn= 978-2-84416-145-1|page= 266}}</ref>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Mycena arcangeliana'' grows on dead [[deciduous]] wood, favouring [[beech]] and [[ash (tree)|ash]],<ref name="Sterry"/> where it grows in "small troops".<ref name="Jordan"/> It has also been recorded less frequently on [[conifer]]s, [[bracken]] and [[Japanese knotweed]]. There have been reports from grassland, but these are probably a misidentification of ''M. flavescens''.<ref name="checklist"/> It is infrequently to commonly found in late summer to autumn months in the British Isles,<ref name="Sterry"/><ref name="Jordan"/> though it is more commonly encountered in the south.<ref name="Sterry"/> Its distribution is fairly widespread elsewhere in Europe, though it is less common.<ref name="checklist"/> It has been listed as vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Fungi in Norway.<ref name="Aronsen"/> "''Mycena oortiana''", which was rarely found in mycological literature, was described as a predominantly west-European species;<ref name="Kotlaba"/> however, ''M. arcangeliana'' has also been recorded in Scandinavia,<ref name="Aronsen"/> Greenland,<ref name="Borgen"/> and Italy, from where it was first described.<ref name="microscopical"/>
