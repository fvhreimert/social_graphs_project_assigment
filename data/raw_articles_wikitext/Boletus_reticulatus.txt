'''''Boletus reticulatus''''' (alternately known as '''''Boletus aestivalis''''' (Paulet) [[Elias Fries|Fr.]]), and commonly referred to as the '''summer cep''' is a basidiomycete fungus of the [[genus]] ''[[Boletus]]''. It occurs in deciduous forests of Europe, where it forms a symbiotic [[mycorrhiza]]l relationship with species of oak (''[[Quercus]]''). The fungus produces fruiting bodies in the summer months which are edible and popularly collected. The summer cep was formally described by [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] as ''Boletus reticulatus'' in 1774, which took precedence over ''B. aestivalis'' as described by [[Jean-Jacques Paulet]] in 1793.

==Taxonomy==
German naturalist [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] described the summer cep as ''Boletus reticulatus'' in 1774, in his series on fungi of [[Bavaria]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], ''Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur icones.''<ref name="Schaeffer 1774"/>  French mycologist [[Jean-Jacques Paulet]] described it as Le grand Mousseux (''Tubiporus aestivalis'') in 1793, adding that it was delicious with chicken fricassee and could be found in the [[Bois de Boulogne]] in summer.<ref>{{cite book |language =French |last1=Paulet |first1=Jean-Jacques |title=Traité des champignons |date=1793 |publisher=Impr. nationale |location=Paris |pages=371–372 |url=https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k9690030w/f487.item}}</ref> the species name the species name is derived from the [[Latin]] ''aestas'' "summer". Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] followed Paulet, using ''Boletus aestivalis'' in 1838.<ref name="Fries 1838">{{cite book |last=Fries |first=E.

''Boletus reticulatus'' is classified in ''Boletus'' [[section (botany)|section]] ''Boletus'', alongside close relatives such as ''[[Boletus aereus|B.&nbsp;aereus]]'', ''[[Boletus edulis|B.&nbsp;edulis]]'', and ''[[Boletus pinophilus|B.&nbsp;pinophilus]]''. A genetic study of the four European species found that ''B.&nbsp;reticulatus'' was [[sister taxon|sister]] to ''B.&nbsp;aereus''.<ref name="Beugelsdijk 2008"/> More extensive testing of worldwide taxa revealed that ''B.&nbsp;reticulatus'' was most closely related to two lineages that had been classified as ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' from southern China and Korea/northern China respectively. The common ancestor of these three species was related to a lineage consisting of ''B.&nbsp;aereus'' and the genetically close ''[[Boletus mamorensis|B.&nbsp;mamorensis]]''.<ref name="Dentinger 2010"/> Molecular analysis suggests that the ''B.&nbsp;aereus/mamorensis'' and ''B.&nbsp;reticulatus''/Chinese ''B.'' "edulis" lineages [[genetic divergence|diverged]] around 6 to 7 million years ago.<ref name="Feng 2012"/>

The [[British Mycological Society]] approved the name "summer bolete" for ''Boletus reticulatus''.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | last = Phillips |first=Roger | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page= 275}}</ref>

==Description==
The summer cep's fruiting body is a mushroom with a swollen bulbous stem, and large convex cap. The cap is more or less round and usually up to {{Convert|30|cm}} in diameter.<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |page=177}}</ref> It bears a velvety brown, rust to chocolate cuticle which when dry often cracks to reveal the white flesh underneath, giving the appearance of a net.

The darker, more uniform shade and the velvety feel of the cap are a key feature distinguishing this species as is the vagueness or total absence of a white edge to the cap margin as seen in ''[[Boletus edulis]]''. The tubes and pores of the [[hymenium]] are initially white, darkening with age to pale yellow and finally brown. The stipe is central, up to about {{Convert|12|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} tall,<ref name="tfb" /> and has a strongly marked reticulated pattern with a variable white to brown colour.

The flesh is white and thick and remains firm if yellowish as the mushroom ages, and is often attacked by insect larvae. Its odour is pleasant.

==Distribution and habitat==
The summer cep is found in woods throughout Europe, after hot and humid weather, from the start of summer until the end of autumn. It is particularly common in the south and west of France, as well as in Tosco-Emiliano [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] in [[Italy]]. It is less host-specific than other porcini mushrooms.<ref name="Feng 2012"/> It occurs in Ukraine and Crimea,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Akulov |first1=O.Yu |last2=Pryidiuk |first2=M.P. |title=] The preliminary checklist of boletoid fungi of Ukraine |journal=Pagine di Micologia |date=2007 |volume=27 |issue=117–144 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323320519}}</ref> and [[Republic of Karelia]], [[Karachay-Cherkessia]], [[Krasnodar Krai]], [[Tula Oblast]], [[Moscow Oblast]], and as far east as [[Primorsky Krai]] in Russia.<ref name=fedosova14>{{cite journal |last1=Fedosova |first1=Anna G. |last2=Kovalenko |first2=Alexander E. |title=Section ''Boletus'' of the genus ''Boletus'' in Russia: species diversity, morphology, ecology and phylogeny |journal=Mikologiya i Fitopatologiya |date=2014 | issn=0026-3648 |language=Russian |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=86–106}}</ref> ''Boletus reticulatus'' has been recovered from southern Africa, where it was likely introduced, growing under the Mexican species ''[[Pinus patula]]''.<ref name="Feng 2012"/>

== Edibility ==
The summer cep, like most ceps, is edible and useful in cooking. However, its flesh is somewhat less firm than other ceps. Based on analysis of fruit bodies collected in Portugal, there are 334 [[kilocalorie]]s per 100 gram of bolete (as [[dry matter|dry weight]]).  The [[macronutrient]] composition of 100 grams of dried bolete includes 22.6 grams of [[dietary protein|protein]], 55.1 grams of [[carbohydrate]]s, and 2.6 grams of [[dietary fat|fat]]. By weight, fresh fruit bodies are about 91% water.<ref name="Heleno 2011"/> ''B. reticulatus'' contains predominantly unsaturated fatty acids; mainly cis-linoleic acid, followed by cis-oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2013/163964|doi-access=free|title=Fatty Acid Compositions of Six Wild Edible Mushroom Species|year=2013|last1=Günç Ergönül|first1=Pelin|last2=Akata|first2=Ilgaz|last3=Kalyoncu|first3=Fatih|last4=Ergönül|first4=Bülent|journal=The Scientific World Journal|volume=2013|pages=1–4|pmid=23844377|pmc=3690749}}</ref> The carbohydrate component contains the [[monosaccharide]]s [[glucose]], [[mannitol]] and α,α-[[trehalose]], the [[polysaccharide]] [[glycogen]], and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide [[chitin]], which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom [[cell wall]]s. Chitin, [[hemicellulose]], and [[pectin]]-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to high proportion of insoluble fibre in ''B.&nbsp;reticulatus''. It also contains more [[tocopherol]] than other species of mushroom.<ref name=Kalac2009>{{cite journal |author=Kalač P. |year=2009 |title=Chemical composition and nutritional value of European species of wild growing mushrooms: a review |journal=Food Chemistry |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=9–16 |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.07.077}}</ref><!-- cites 2 previous sentences -->
