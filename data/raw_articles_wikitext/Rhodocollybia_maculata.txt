'''''Rhodocollybia maculata'',''' commonly known as the '''spotted toughshank''', is a species of [[Basidiomycota#:~:text=Basidiomycota are filamentous fungi composed,specialized spores are called basidiospores.|basidiomycete]] fungus in the family [[Omphalotaceae]].<ref>{{cite web | vauthors = Kuo M | date = March 2018 | url = http://www.mushroomexpert.com/rhodocollybia_maculata.html | title = ''Rhodocollybia maculata'' | work = MushroomExpert.Com }}</ref> ''R.&nbsp;maculata'' is a source of [[collybolide]], a sesquiterpenoid containing a furyl-ẟ-lactone motif reminiscent of [[salvinorin&nbsp;A]].

==Description==
The cap is up to {{Convert|9|cm|frac=4}} wide and cream-colored with red-brown spots.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |page=479}}</ref> The edge remains inrolled for an extended period of time. The whitish gills are crowded, becoming spotted in age. The similarly colored stipe is up to 10&nbsp;cm long,<ref name="audu" /> tough, hollow, and tapered downwards.<ref name=":1">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest |vauthors=Trudell S, Ammirati J |publisher=Timber Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5 |series=Timber Press Field Guides |location=Portland, OR |page=120}}</ref> The [[spore print]] is whitish to yellowish.<ref name="audu" />

A variety known as ''scorzonerea'' is characterized by yellowish color of its gills, and sometimes the stipe.<ref name=":1" />

==Distribution and habitat==
It is widespread in North America.<ref name="audu" /> It often appears in decomposing conifer duff.<ref name=":1" />

== Kappa-opioid receptor agonism ==
{{Main|Collybolide}}In 2016, Gupta ''et al.'' reported that collybolide exhibited high-potency, selective kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonism.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gupta A, Gomes I, Bobeck EN, Fakira AK, Massaro NP, Sharma I, Cavé A, Hamm HE, Parello J, Devi LA | display-authors = 6 | title = Collybolide is a novel biased agonist of κ-opioid receptors with potent antipruritic activity | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 21 | pages = 6041–6046 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27162327 | pmc = 4889365 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1521825113 | bibcode = 2016PNAS..113.6041G | doi-access = free }}</ref> Due to its attractive bioactivity and chemical similarity to [[salvinorin A]], collybolide garnered attention in the synthetic chemistry and pharmacology fields as a potential scaffold for developing next-generation analgesics, antipruritics, and antidepressants.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan MI, Sawyer BJ, Akins NS, Le HV | title = A systematic review on the kappa opioid receptor and its ligands: New directions for the treatment of pain, anxiety, depression, and drug abuse | journal = European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 243 | article-number = 114785 | date = December 2022 | pmid = 36179400 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejmech.2022.114785 | s2cid = 252476850 | url = https://chemrxiv.org/engage/api-gateway/chemrxiv/assets/orp/resource/item/62c8920a6383266dc946ad00/original/a-systematic-review-on-the-kappa-opioid-receptor-and-its-ligands-new-directions-for-the-treatment-of-pain-anxiety-depression-and-drug-abuse.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chakraborty S, Majumdar S | title = Natural Products for the Treatment of Pain: Chemistry and Pharmacology of Salvinorin A, Mitragynine, and Collybolide | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 60 | issue = 18 | pages = 1381–1400 | date = May 2021 | pmid = 32930582 | pmc = 7982354 | doi = 10.1021/acs.biochem.0c00629 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |vauthors=Bui AM, Cavé A, Janot MM, Parello J, Potier P, Scheidegger U |date=1974-01-01 |title=Isolement et analyse structurale du collybolide, nouveau sesquiterpene extrait de Collybia maculata alb. et sch. ex fries (basidiomycetes) |trans-title=Isolation and structural analysis of collybolide, a new sesquiterpene extracted from Collybia maculata alb. and sch. ex fries (basidiomycetes) |journal=Tetrahedron |language=fr |volume=30 |issue=11 |pages=1327–1336 |doi=10.1016/S0040-4020(01)97243-6 |issn=0040-4020}}</ref>

In 2022, Shevick ''et al.'' completed the first enantioselective total synthesis of collybolide and profiled the activity of synthetic collybolide at the KOR. Despite previous findings by Gupta ''et al.'', these assays showed that neither enantiomer of collybolide had KOR activity.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shevick SL, Freeman SM, Tong G, Russo RJ, Bohn LM, Shenvi RA | title = Asymmetric Syntheses of (+)- and (-)-Collybolide Enable Reevaluation of ''kappa''-Opioid Receptor Agonism | journal = ACS Central Science | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = 948–954 | date = July 2022 | pmid = 35912357 | pmc = 9335922 | doi = 10.1021/acscentsci.2c00442 }}</ref> The synthetic sample was identical to natural collybolide isolated from ''R.&nbsp;maculata.''
