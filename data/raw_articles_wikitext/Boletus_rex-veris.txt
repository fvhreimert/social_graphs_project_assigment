'''''Boletus rex-veris''''', commonly known as the '''spring king bolete''', is a [[basidiomycota|basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Boletus]]'' found in western [[North America]]. The large, edible fruiting bodies known as [[mushroom]]s appear under pine trees, generally in May to June. It has a pinkish to brownish cap and its stem is often large and swollen, and the overall colour may have an orange-red tinge. As with other [[boletes]], the size of the fruiting body is variable. ''Boletus rex-veris'' is edible, and may be preserved and cooked.

For many years, ''Boletus rex-veris'' was considered a [[subspecies]] or [[Form (botany)|form]] of the porcini mushroom ''[[Boletus edulis|B. edulis]]''.  In 2008, a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] revision of western North American populations of this species was published, formally establishing it as a distinct species, ''Boletus rex-veris''.<ref name=eb1/>  [[Phylogenetics|Phylogenetic]] analysis has shown ''B. rex-veris'' as a member of a [[clade]], or closely related group, with ''[[Boletus fibrillosus|B. fibrillosus]]'', ''[[Boletus pinophilus|B. pinophilus]]'', ''[[Boletus subcaerulescens|B. subcaerulescens]]'', ''[[Boletus subalpinus|B. subalpinus]]'', and ''[[Boletus regineus|B. regineus]]''.<ref name=dent10/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Boletus rex-veris'' is found under pines (''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'', [[Lodgepole Pine|''P. contorta'' subsp. ''murrayana'']]) and firs (''[[Abies concolor]]'' and ''[[Abies]]'' species) at elevations of {{convert|3000|to|7000|ft|m}}. It is often buried under needle duff and fruits from May to June in California. In Oregon it fruits at lower elevations, and its range continues into Washington, Idaho, and British Columbia.

==Edibility==
The ''Boletus rex-veris'' is edible and delicious. It has significant commercial value in areas where it fruits prolifically.
