'''''Agaricus placomyces''''' is a toxic [[basidiomycete]] fungus of the genus ''[[Agaricus]]''. It is found in [[North America]]; the [[Eurasia]]n populations formerly known by the same scientific name are nowadays known as ''[[Agaricus moelleri|A.&nbsp;moelleri]]'', while the present species may also be referred to as ''A.&nbsp;praeclaresquamosus''.

==Description==

''Agaricus placomyces'' has a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is {{convert|5–13|cm|frac=4}} wide and varies from convex<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=548}}</ref> to broadly convex or nearly flat in age. In addition, the surface of the cap is dry and covered with brownish [[fiber]]s and [[Scale (zoology)|scales]], especially over the center. Underneath, the cap can be whitish under normal [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]s, or pinkish in wet weather. Covered with fine, appressed greyish-brown scales and concentrated at the disc, the cap is thick, slowly becoming [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] when injured; the odor smells of [[phenol]].<ref name="Miller 2006" /> The flesh is white, and becomes yellow when placed in [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kuo |first=Michael |date=January 2018 |title=Agaricus placomyces (MushroomExpert.Com) |url=https://www.mushroomexpert.com/agaricus_placomyces.html |access-date=2024-11-23 |website=www.mushroomexpert.com}}</ref>

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] of this mushroom are free from the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], crowded, and pale grayish-pink, turning brown in age. In addition, the stem is 6–15&nbsp;cm long, 1–1.5&nbsp;cm. thick and more or less equal, with an enlarged base (unlike typically ending in a small bulb like ''[[Agaricus pocillator]]''). Also, it is fairly smooth, white and bruising yellow, especially at the base, with a persistent [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and the [[partial veil]] when still covering the gills developing brownish to yellowish droplets.<ref>[http://www.deq.state.mi.us/documents/deq-ogs-gimdl-PU26A.PDF Breitenbach & Kränzlin (vol. 4): sp. 188] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424073940/http://www.deq.state.mi.us/documents/deq-ogs-gimdl-PU26A.PDF |date=April 24, 2009 }}</ref><ref>Freeman, A.E.H. (1979). ''Agaricus in the southeastern United States''. ''Mycotaxon'' '''8'''(1): 50–118.</ref>

At 8–15&nbsp;cm long and 2–3.5&nbsp;cm thick, the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is slightly enlarged at the base; the surface is white, and smooth above and below the ring. The veil of the stipe is [[Biological membrane|membranous]], thick, white, and forms a persistent ring with a smooth upper and lower surface. The base of the stipe is typically yellow when bruised and smells of phenol.<ref>Kerrigan, Richard W. (1986). The Agaricales (Gilled Fungi) of California. 6. Agaricaceae. Mad River Press: Eureka, CA. 62 p.</ref>



The [[spore]]s are 4–6.0 x 3.5–4.5&nbsp;[[μm]], smooth, and elliptical;{{Citation needed|date=March 2025}} the [[spore print]] is dark brown.<ref name="audu" />

==Habitat and distribution==
''Agaricus placomyces'' is [[saprobic]]. In addition, it grows in groups under hardwoods and in mixed woods during summer and fall. It is generally found east of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and northern in distribution. Generally, it is solitary, living in either small groups, or clusters on [[disturbed ground]] under [[conifer]]s. Unlike many other ''Agaricus'' species, it fruits from mid to late winter rather than during the late spring, summer and early fall.<ref>Kerrigan, R.W., Callac, P., Guinberteau, J., Challen, M.P. & Parra, L.

== Toxicity ==
''Agaricus placomyces'' contains toxins which cause [[gastrointestinal upset]],<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=278|author-link=Orson K.
