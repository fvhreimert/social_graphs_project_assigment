'''''Tricholoma ustaloides''''' is a [[species]] of [[mushroom]] in the large genus ''[[Tricholoma]]''. It has a widespread distribution in Europe, where it is typically found in association with [[oak]] and [[beech]] trees.  Although generally considered inedible, it is consumed by some in Mexico.

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is red-brown or chestnut-brown with a paler margin, very sticky when moist, and has a diameter of {{convert|4|to|8|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="isbn90-5410-492-9">{{cite book |author=Bas, Cornelis |title=Flora agaricina Neerlandica: critical monographs on families of agarics and boleti occurring in the Netherlands|publisher=A.A. Balkema |location=Rotterdam |year=1988 |page=127 |isbn=90-5410-492-9}}</ref> The overall shape of the cap is bell-like when young, later flattening to a more irregular convex shape in maturity, and often developing a lobed appearance. The margins of the caps are usually turned inwards. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded together, [[Lamella (mycology)|adnate]] or [[Lamella (mycology)|emarginate]] in attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and white or a light [[ochraceous]] yellow with dark brown stains when old or bruised. The stipe is {{convert|4|to|10|cm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} thick, roughly spindle-shaped ([[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]]), with red-brown [[fibrils]] and a sharply defined zone of white color at the stalk apex, especially in more mature specimens.<ref name="isbn0-89815-169-4"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white or cream, smelling strongly of [[flour|meal]], with a bitter taste.<ref>[http://www.grzyby.pl/gatunki/Tricholoma_ustale.htm Gryzyby―Fungi of Poland]</ref><ref name="isbn0-7153-0129-2"/>

[[Spore]]s have a roughly spherical or ellipsoid shape, are [[hyaline]], smooth, non-[[amyloid]], and have dimensions of 5.5—7.0 x 4.5—5.5 [[micrometre|μm]].<ref name="isbn90-5410-492-9"/> [[Basidia]] are 4-spored and [[cystidia]] are absent.<ref name="isbn0-7153-0129-2"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
This [[mycorrhizal]] species typically grows in small groups, and is often found near trees in the genera [[Quercus]] and [[Beech|Fagus]].<ref name="isbn90-5410-492-9"/>

Although relatively rare, it has a widespread distribution in [[Europe]], limited by the presence of its preferred tree hosts. Its first recorded appearance in [[Mexico]] was 1984.<ref>Aroche RM, Cifuentes J, Lorea F, Fuentes P, Bonavides J, Galicia H, Menendez E, Aguilar O, Valenzuela V. (1984).
