'''''Amanita gemmata''''', commonly known as the '''gemmed amanita'''<ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> or the '''jonquil amanita''', is an [[agaric]] mushroom of the family [[Amanitaceae]] and genus ''[[Amanita]]''. The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] has a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is a dull to golden shade of yellow, and typically {{convert|2.5–12|cm|abbr=off|frac=8}} in diameter. The cap surface is sticky when moist, and characterized by white warts, which are easily detached. It is initially convex, and flattens out when mature. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white and does not change colour when cut. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white and closely spaced. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is pale yellow, and measures {{convert|4–12|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} long by {{convert|0.5–1.9|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick. The [[partial veil]] that covers the young fruit body turns into the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the stem at maturity. The [[spore print]] is white. It resembles numerous other species.

This species is a [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, widespread in Europe. It can grow either singly, scattered, or in groups. It prefers habitats like [[conifer]]ousand [[mixed forest]]s and alongside paths, where it fruits in summer and fall. It is a toxic mushroom, containing [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]].

The species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by Swedish mycologist and botanist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus gemmatus'' in 1838.<ref name="Fries 1839" /> It was transferred to the genus ''Amanita'' in 1866 by the French statistician [[Louis Bertillon]].<ref name="Bertillon 1866" /> The species has been transferred to several genera in its history, resulting in a number of [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]], including ''Amanita muscaria'' var. ''gemmata'' (1886, [[Lucien Quélet]]), ''Amanitopsis gemmata'' (1887, [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]]), ''Amanitaria gemmata'' (1940, [[Jean-Edouard Gilbert]]), and ''Venenarius gemmatus'' (1948, [[William Murrill]]).<ref name="urlMycoBank: Amanita gemmata" /> ''Amanita'' authority Rodham E. Tulloss considers ''A.&nbsp;amici'' (published by [[Claude Casimir Gillet]] in 1891) to be synonymous with ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'', as the macroscopic characteristics of the former fall within the limits of the range expected for the latter.<ref name="urlAmanitaceae.org" />

Within the genus ''[[Amanita]]'', ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in [[subgenus]] ''Amanita'', [[section (botany)|section]] ''Amanita'', subsection ''Gemmatae'', and series ''Gemmatae''.<ref name="urlAmanitaceae.org" /> Tulloss places the species in a stirps (an informal ranking above species level) with ''[[Amanita russuloides|A.&nbsp;russuloides]]'' and ''[[Amanita viscidolutea|A.&nbsp;viscidolutea]]''.<ref name="urlAmanitaceae.org–stirps Gemmata" /> Some mycologists believe that ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'' is not different from ''A.&nbsp;russuloides''.<ref name="Murrill 1913" /> Two [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] studies based on sequences of the large [[ribosomal RNA|ribosomal subunit RNA]] gene (nLSU-rDNA) and the mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit RNA gene (mtSSU-rDNA) show that ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'' is part of a [[clade]] within ''Amanita'' with its close relatives ''[[Amanita muscaria|A.&nbsp;muscaria]]'', ''[[Amanita farinosa|A.&nbsp;farinosa]]'' and ''[[Amanita roseitincta|A.&nbsp;roseitincta]]''.<ref name="Moncalvo 2000" /><ref name="Moncalvo 1999" />

The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "gemmed Amanita", the "jonquil Amanita",<ref name="Arora 1986" /> or the "European gemmed Amanita".<ref name="urlAmanitaceae.org" />

==Description==


The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are colored yellow overall. The fresh [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], ranging in color from dull [[cream (color)|cream]]y yellow to golden yellow to [[buff (color)|buff]], is sticky when moist. White warts adorn the cap surface, but they are usually flimsy and easily washed away by rain. They are placed randomly, but tend to be more concentrated in the center. The cap is typically {{convert|2.5–12|cm|abbr=off|frac=8}} in diameter, and initially convex before flattening out in maturity. The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, and shows no change when sliced.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/>

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate to adnexed, and white; they are close together, with little intervening space. The pale yellowish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4–12|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} long by {{convert|0.5–1.9|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick, and either roughly equal in width throughout, or slightly thicker at the base. Young mushrooms have a membranous [[partial veil]] extending from the upper stem to the cap margin; as the mushroom grows, the partial veil tears to leave a flimsy, skirt-like, easily lost [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the stem. At the base of the stem is a white [[volva (mycology)|volva]] (a remnant of the [[universal veil]] that covered the immature mushroom) that usually forms a small, free rim. The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> There is no distinctive odour.<ref name="urlKuoM"/>

===Microscopic characteristics===


''Amanita gemmata'' has ellipsoid to broadly ellipsoid [[Basidiospore|spores]] measuring 8–10 by 6.5–7.5&nbsp;[[μm]] with an average Q-ratio (the fraction of length/width) of 1.35; they are not [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]. The spores are smooth, thin-walled, and they contain one to several small oil droplets.<ref name="urlAmanitaceae.org"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells of the [[hymenium]]) are usually four-spored, club shaped, and measure 30–40 by 8–11&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/>

The gill tissue is ''divergent'', meaning that the cells are more or less parallel near the center of the gill, but bend outwards near the end of the gill. The [[hypha]]e in this tissue are cylindrical to inflated, thin walled, [[hyaline]] (translucent) to yellowish, and measure 2.2–9&nbsp;μm wide; the hyphae in the central strand are narrower and typically cylindrical. The hyphae of the subhymenium (a layer of tissue directly under the [[hymenium]]) are interwoven. These hyphae are branched, cylindrical to slightly inflated, hyaline, and  6–9&nbsp;μm wide. The hyphae of the [[cap cuticle]] are filamentous, interwoven, and radially arranged. They are cylindrical, 2.7–4&nbsp;μm wide, thin-walled, hyaline to yellowish, and gelatinize when mounted in [[potassium hydroxide]]. The cap tissue is also interwoven, with hyphae that are cylindrical to somewhat inflated, 3.7–14.6&nbsp;μm wide, thin-walled, branched, and hyaline to yellowish. Caulo[[cystidia]] are abundant on the apex of the stem; they are club-shaped to cylindrical, thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 3–9&nbsp;μm wide. The annulus tissue comprises interwoven cylindrical hyphae measuring 3–9&nbsp;μm wide. Sphaerocysts (inflated, spherical cells) are also present in the annulus tissue; they are club shaped to ellipsoidal, with dimensions of 29–55 by 30–70&nbsp;μm. The warts on the cap surface (remnants of the universal veil) comprise loosely interwoven cylindrical to inflated thin-walled hyphae that are 3.5–8&nbsp;μm wide. Sphaerocysts in this tissue are 58.5–70.2 by 17.5–40&nbsp;μm, ellipsoidal, and hyaline. The volval tissue is interwoven, with cylindrical, hyaline hyphae that are 4.4–7.3&nbsp;μm wide. The sphaerocysts here are ellipsoidal to roughly spherical, hyaline, and measure 35–70 by 20–35&nbsp;μm. In ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'', where they are most abundant in the region just below the cap cuticle, these [[refractive]] cells are scattered, and have a width of 3.7–6&nbsp;μm. [[Clamp connection]]s are rare in the hyphae of ''A.&nbsp;gemmata''; they are present in the annulus, gill tissue, subhymenium, and cap tissue.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/>

===Similar species===

There are numerous species in North America that resemble ''A.&nbsp;gemmata''.<ref name="Bresinsky 1989"/> In 2005, mycologist Rod Tulloss described ''[[Amanita aprica]]'', a species that has been confused with ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'' several times in the past.<ref name="Tulloss 2005"/> According to mycologists Pierre Neville and Serge Poumarat, the Mediterranean species ''A.&nbsp;amici'' (synonymous with ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'' [[Form (botany)|f.]] ''amici'')<ref name="urlMycoBank: Amanita amici" /> is similar in appearance to ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'' but is larger. According to Tulloss however, their measurements of the cap and stem dimensions of ''A.&nbsp;amici'' fell within the range expected for ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'', and for this reason, the two taxa should be considered [[conspecific]].<ref name="urlAmanitaceae.org"/> Neville and Poumarat suggest that the name ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'' still persists for Mediterranean collections because of its frequent historical misapplication to the native Italian species ''[[Amanita gioiosa|A.&nbsp;gioiosa]]'', which had not been described as a distinct species until 2004.<ref name="urlAmanitaceae.org"/> ''[[Amanita orientigemmata|A.&nbsp;orientigemmata]]'', a mushroom ranging from Japan to China, is a lookalike, but has [[clamp connection|clamps]], unlike ''A.&nbsp;gemmata''. Other differences between the two species include the slightly smaller spores of ''A.&nbsp;orientigemmata'', and differences in the microstructure of the cap warts.<ref name="urlAmanitaceae.org–orientigemmata"/>

It is often confused with various other European species, resembling the [[Amanita citrina|false death cap]], [[Amanita fulva|tawny grisette]] and [[panther cap]] mushrooms.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}} Its cap is brighter in color than the former, and more yellow than the latter two.

==Habitat and distribution==

The fungus favours sandy and slightly [[acidic soil]]s, and is often found in association with [[Norway Spruce]] (''Picea abies''). The mushroom grows either singly, scattered, or in groups in [[conifer]]ousand [[mixed forest]]s, especially along paths and roads.<ref name="Arora 1986" /><ref name="McKnight 1987" />

]]

The species is distributed in areas of Asia and Europe. It is widely distributed (as a species cluster) in North America,<ref name="Arora 1986" /> where it has been found as far south as [[Ixtlán de Juárez]], Mexico.<ref name="Villanueva-Jimenez 2006" /> The species has been reported from the [[Dominican Republic]].<ref name="Gallart 1997" /> In South America, it is known from Chile and Colombia.<ref name="Sierralta 1994" /> In Asia, the mushroom has been collected from Iran<ref name="Saber 1995" /> and China.<ref name="Zhishu 1993" />

==Ecology==
''Amanita gemmata'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, meaning it forms a [[mutualism (biology)|mutually beneficial]] relationship with the roots of compatible [[host (biology)|host]] plants. Through the association, the plant provides the fungus with a carbon source, and the fungus provides the plant with several benefits such as nutrients and protection from pathogens. Largent and collaborators (1980) document mycorrhizal associations of ''A.&nbsp;gemmata'' with [[Manzanita]] (''Arctostaphylos'' spp.) and ''[[Pinus contorta]]'' (lodgepole pine),<ref name="Largent 1980" /> and Nieto and Carbone with ''[[Pinus pinaster]]'' (maritime pine) in Spain.<ref name="Nieto 2008" />

==Toxicity==
Toxicity is suspected to be due to the presence of [[muscimol]] and [[ibotenic acid]],<ref name="Gilbert 2008" /> which is also found in many species in [[section (botany)|section]] Amanita of the ''Amanita'' genus, including ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' and ''[[Amanita pantherina|A.&nbsp;pantherina]]''.

Generally, symptoms of poisoning appear within three hours of ingestion of the mushroom as [[Visual hallucinations#Visual|visual hallucinations]], [[nausea]], vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, irregular and slow heart beat and agitation. Severe cases involving [[coma]], [[convulsions]], or death are extremely rare.<ref name="ncsu" />
