'''''Morchella vulgaris''''' is a widespread [[fungus]] of the family [[Morchellaceae]] ([[Ascomycota]]). It was originally described in 1801 as a [[Form (botany)|form]] of the common yellow [[morel]] (''[[Morchella esculenta]]'') by mycologist [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]], but was later recombined as a distinct [[species]] by [[Samuel Frederick Gray|Samuel Gray]].<ref>Gray SF. (1821). A Natural Arrangement of British Plants, according to their relations to each other Vol. 1. p. 662.</ref>

Owing to its high [[Morphology (biology)|morphological plasticity]], its taxonomical status had long been in flux, sometimes treated as a [[Variety (botany)|variety]] of, or conspecific to ''[[Morchella esculenta]]'',<ref>Breitenbach J, Kränzlin F. (1984). Fungi of Switzerland, Volume 1: Ascomycetes. Verlag Mykologia, Luzern, Switzerland. p. 314.</ref><ref>Dennis RWG. (1978). Bristish Ascomycètes. Ed. Cramer, Vaduz. p. 585.</ref> while at the same time several forms and varieties of ''M. vulgaris'' itself have been described.<ref name="Clowez 2012">{{cite journal |author=Clowez P. |title=Les morilles.

This species is characterised by the predominantly grey colours of its [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] and "blistered", highly irregular appearance of its ridges and pits.
