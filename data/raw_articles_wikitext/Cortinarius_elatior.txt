'''''Cortinarius elatior''''' is a species of mushroom native to Europe which is commonly known as the '''wrinkled webcap''' due to the cap's tendency to wrinkle with age.

== Description ==
''Cortinarius elatior'' is a large webcap mushroom with white flesh.

'''Stem:''' 5-8cm. Tapers down to the base such that it has a pointed appearance which is wider at the top. Partial veil is pale violet to blue in colour forming and indistinct ring zone. '''Gills:''' Cream turning reddish-brown with age. Spacing is distant and attachment to the stipe is adnate. '''Spore print:''' Reddish-brown. '''Spores:''' Almond to lemon shaped with warts. 11-15 x 7.5-9 μm. '''Taste:''' Indistinct. '''Smell:''' Sweet like honey but not pleasant.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Buczacki |first=Stefan |title=Collins fungi guide |date=2012 |publisher=Collins |isbn=978-0-00-724290-0 |location=London |oclc=793683235}}</ref>
