'''''Boletus rubriceps''''' is a species of [[bolete]] fungus in the family [[Boletaceae]]. Although it was officially described as new to science in 2014, the bolete had previously been reported as either ''[[Boletus edulis]]'' or ''[[Boletus pinophilus|B.&nbsp;pinophilus]]''. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis showed that it was sufficiently different from other [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar ''[[Boletus]]'' species to warrant designation as a distinct species. It is found in the southwestern United States and southern [[Rocky Mountains]], where it associates with [[spruce]], [[pine]], and sometimes [[fir]]. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are [[edible mushroom|edible]] and highly sought after; they are often sold in [[farmer's market]]s of [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Colorado]], and are used in some restaurants. The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] refers to the reddish color of the [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] ([[Latin]] ''ruber'' = "red"; ''caput'' = "head" or "cap"). [[Common name]]s given to the bolete include "Ruby Porcini",<ref name="iNaturalist"/> "Rocky Mountain red-capped king bolete” or “Rocky Mountain red".<ref name="Arora 2014"/>
