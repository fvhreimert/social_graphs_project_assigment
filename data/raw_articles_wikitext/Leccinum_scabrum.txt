'''''Leccinum scabrum''''', commonly known as the '''birch bolete''',<ref name="Arora1986" /> '''rough-stemmed bolete''', or '''scaber stalk''', is a species of fungus in the family [[Boletaceae]]. It was formerly classified as ''Boletus scaber''.

The birch bolete is widespread in Europe, in the [[Himalayas]] in Asia, and elsewhere in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], occurring only in [[mycorrhiza]]l association with [[birch]] trees. This mushroom is also becoming increasingly common in Australia and New Zealand where it is likely [[introduced species|introduced]]. It is an [[edible mushroom]] if only firm specimens are used and cooked thoroughly.

==Description==


The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|4–10|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} wide and convex before flattening.<ref name=Arora1986>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/541/mode/2up |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |year=1986 |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=541-42}}</ref> The skin of the cap is tan or brownish, usually with a lighter edge;<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=227–228}}</ref> it is smooth, bald, and dry to viscid.<ref name=":0" />

The pores are whitish<ref name=":0" /> at a young age, later gray. In older specimens, the pores on the pileus can bulge out, while around the stipe they dent in strongly. The pore covering is easy to remove from the skin of the pileus.{{Citation needed|date=June 2025}} The [[spore print]] is brown. The [[Spore|spores]] measure 13–16 by 4–4.5 μm and are elliptical.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=347}}</ref>

The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|5–15|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1–3.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide and slim, with white and dark to black flakes; it tapers upward.<ref name=":0" /> The basic [[mycelium]] is white.

The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, sometimes darkening following exposure.<ref name=":0" /> In young specimens, the meat is relatively firm,<ref name=":0" /> but it very soon becomes spongy and holds water, especially in rainy weather. When cooked, the meat turns black.{{Citation needed|date=October 2025|reason=Can't find reference that states the meat turns black when cooked.}}

=== Similar species ===
Several different species of ''[[Leccinum]]'' mushrooms are found in mycorrhiza with birches, and can be confused by amateurs and [[mycologists]] alike. ''[[Leccinum holopus|L.&nbsp;holopus]]'' is paler and whitish in all parts. ''[[Leccinum alaskanum|L.&nbsp;alaskanum]]'', common with birch in Alaska, has a dark and light, streaked or mottled cap.<ref name="Arora1986" /> ''[[Leccinum variicolor|L.&nbsp;variicolor]]'' has a bluish stipe. ''[[Leccinum oxydabile|L.&nbsp;oxydabile]]'' has firmer, pinkish flesh and a different pileus skin structure.
