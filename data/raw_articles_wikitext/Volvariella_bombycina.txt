'''''Volvariella bombycina''''', commonly known as the '''silky volvariella''',<ref name="Arora 1986" /> '''silky sheath''', '''silky rosegill''', '''silver-silk straw mushroom''', or '''tree mushroom''', is a species of fungus in the family [[Pluteaceae]].

The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] (mushroom) begins developing in a thin, egg-like sac. This ruptures and the stem expands quickly, leaving the sac at the base of the stem as a [[volva (mycology)|volva]]. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], which can attain a diameter of up to {{convert|20|cm|4=0|abbr=off}}, is white to slightly yellowish and covered with silky hairs. On the underside of the cap are closely spaced [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and initially white before turning pink as the [[spore]]s mature.

It is an uncommon but widespread species, having been reported from Eurasia, Australia, North America, and the Caribbean. The mushroom grows singly or in clusters, often appearing in old knotholes and wounds in [[elm]]s and [[maple]]s. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]] and contains compounds with [[antibacterial]] properties.

== Taxonomy ==
The species was first [[species description|described]] in 1774 by German naturalist [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] as ''Agaricus bombycinus''. Throughout its [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] history, it has been shuffled to several [[genera]], including ''[[Pluteus]]'' (by [[Elias Fries]] in 1836),<ref name="Fries 1836" /> ''Volvaria'' ([[Paul Kummer]], 1871),<ref name="Kummer 1871" /> and ''Volvariopsis'' ([[William Alphonso Murrill]], 1911).<ref name="Murrill 1911" /><ref name="urlMycoBank: Volvariella bombycina" /> [[Rolf Singer]] placed it in its current genus, ''[[Volvariella]]'', in 1951.<ref name="Singer 1951" /> Other names that have been applied to the species include [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ''Amanita calyptrata''<ref name="Lamarck 1783" /> and [[August Johann Georg Karl Batsch]]'s ''Agaricus denudatus''<ref name="Batsch 1783" /> (both published in 1783), but these are illegitimate names as Schäffer's earlier 1774 name has [[correct name (botany)|priority]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Volvariella bombycina" />

In 1949, Murrill described the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''flaviceps'' from collections made growing on [[magnolia]] wood in [[Gainesville, Florida]]. Although he originally described it as a new species, ''Volvaria flaviceps'',<ref name="Murrill 1949" /> Robert Shaffer considered it a variety of ''V.&nbsp;bombycina''.<ref name="Shaffer 1957" /> Variety ''microspora'' was first described in 1953, was later (1961) named by [[Richard William George Dennis]];<ref name="Dennis 1961" /> variety ''palmicola'' was originally described as a distinct species ''Volvaria palmicola'' by Belgian mycologist [[Maurice Beely]] in 1928,<ref name="Beely 1928" /> and later as a variety of ''V.&nbsp;bombycina'' by the same author in 1937.<ref name="Shaffer 1962" />

The root for the generic name ''Volvariella'' (as well as ''Volvaria'' and ''Volvariopsis'', genera in which the species had been formerly placed) derives from the [[Latin]] ''volva'', meaning "wrapper" or "a covering".<ref name="Shaffer 1957" /> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''bombycina'' derives from the Latin root ''bombyc'', or "silky".<ref name="Arora 1986" /> [[Common name]]s for the mushroom include the "silky sheath",<ref name="McKnight 1987" /> the "silky rosegill", the "silver-silk straw mushroom", or the "tree mushroom".<ref name="Bessette 1987" />

== Description ==
The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are initially egg-shaped when still enclosed in the [[universal veil]]. As they expand, the [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] later becoming bell-shaped or convex, and finally nearly flattened in age, attaining a diameter of {{convert|5–20|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}}. The dry cap surface is covered with silky threads. Its color is white to yellowish, becoming more pale approaching the margin. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, soft, and white,<ref name="Arora 1986"/> and has an odor resembling raw potatoes.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded close together, free from attachment to the stem, and initially white before turning pinkish as the spores mature. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures {{convert|6–20|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} long by {{convert|1–3|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick, and is typically tapered upward or thickened below. It is white, with a smooth surface, and is often slightly curved. The [[universal veil]] is membranous, often areolate (cracked into irregularly shaped blocks) or scaly, and forms a long, saclike [[volva (mycology)|volva]] that wraps around the base of the stem. It is white to yellowish or dingy brown, and often divided into lobes.<ref name="Arora 1986"/>



The variety ''V.&nbsp;bombycina'' var. ''flaviceps'' is distinguished from the main form by its smaller, bright yellow caps, up to {{convert|3.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} in diameter, and its dirty-white, scaly volva. Murrill also noted that it developed a "peculiar sickening odor during drying".<ref name="Murrill 1949"/> ''V.&nbsp;bombycina'' var. ''microspora'' has smaller spores (6–7.5 by 4–5&nbsp;[[μm]]), a yellow cap, and a blotched brown volva.<ref name="Dennis 1961"/> ''V.&nbsp;bombycina'' var. ''palmicola'' also has a yellow cap and small spores (5.9–7.5 by 4.3–5.4&nbsp;μm), but can be distinguished from the previous varieties by its distantly spaced gills.<ref name="Shaffer 1962"/>

Mushrooms produce a [[spore print]] with a color ranging from pinkish to [[salmon (color)|salmon]]. The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are elliptical, smooth, and measure 6.5–10 by 4.5–6.5&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Arora 1986" /> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 19–43 by 6–11&nbsp;μm. Pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] that occur on the gill face) are usually spindle shaped, but have a widely variable [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]; they are abundant in the [[hymenium]], and have dimensions of 26–122 by 8–57&nbsp;μm. The cheilocystidia (on the gill edge) are similar in morphology and abundance, some may feature knobs held at the end of slender projections up to 20&nbsp;μm long; dimensions are in the range of 26 and 144&nbsp;μm long by 8–46&nbsp;μm wide. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent from the [[hypha]]e of ''V.&nbsp;bombycina''.<ref name="Shaffer 1957"/>

The fruit bodies can be readily grown in laboratory culture.<ref name="Flegler 1981"/>

=== Bioactive compounds ===
Several [[Biological activity|bioactive]] [[secondary metabolite]]s have been isolated and identified from ''V.&nbsp;bombycina'' fruit bodies, [[mycelium]], or [[pure culture]]. The compounds ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraene-3-one, [[ergosterol peroxide]], indole-3-carboxaldehyde, and [[indazole]] were found in liquid culture.<ref name="Xu 2010" /> In 2009, the novel compound isodeoxyhelicobasidin was identified from culture broth; this compound inhibits the enzyme human [[elastase]].<ref name="Xu 2009" /> The fungus also produces compounds that have [[antioxidative]] activity.<ref name="Badalyan 2003" />

=== Similar species ===
The combination of a silky white cap, white stem, pink gills, pink spore print, and growth on wood is characteristic of this species and make identification of ''V.&nbsp;bombycina'' in the field relatively easy. Some ''[[Pluteus]]'' species have a general similar appearance, and also produce pinkish to pinkish-brown spore prints, but they lack a volva. ''Amanita'' species grow on the ground and make white spore prints. ''[[Volvariella pusilla|V.&nbsp;pusilla]]'' has a small cap measuring {{convert|0.5–3|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter with silky fibers and short lines visible at the cap edge when moist; it grows in soil in gardens and greenhouses and on lawns. ''[[Volvariella hypopithys|V.&nbsp;hypopithys]]'' has a medium-size white cap that is {{convert|2–5|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter with silky to scaly fibers and lacks the short lines at the cap edge when moist; it grows on the ground in woods.<ref name="Bessette 1987"/> ''[[Volvariella caesiotincta|V.&nbsp;caesiotincta]]'' has a bluish-gray cap, while ''[[Volvariella gloiocephala|V.&nbsp;gloiocephala]]'' can be distinguished from ''V.&nbsp;bombycina'' by its smooth cap that is sticky when damp, and a white volva.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/>

== Habitat and distribution ==
.]]

''Volvariella bombycina'' is a [[saprobic]] species.<ref name="urlMushroomExpert" /> Fruit bodies grow singly or in small groups on trunks and decayed stumps of dead hardwoods. Favored species include [[sugar maple]], [[red maple]], [[silver maple]], [[magnolia]], [[mango]], [[beech]], [[oak]], and [[elm]].<ref name="Shaffer 1957" /> It is often found in clefts and [[knothole]]s of dead or living tree trunks.<ref name="Roberts 2011" /> It has been noted to fruit in the same location for several years.<ref name="Dickinson 1982" /> Despite its preference for hardwoods, it has been reported growing on rare instances on [[conifer]]ous wood.<ref name="de Vries 1999" /><ref name="Gams 2002" /> An uncommon species with a wide distribution, it has been reported from Asia (Iran,<ref name="Asef,M.R. 2020">{{cite book |author=Asef M.R. |title=Field guide of Mushrooms of Iran |publisher=Iranshenasi publishing |location=Tehran|year=2020|page=360 |isbn=9786008351429}}</ref> China,<ref name="Zhishu 1993" /> India,<ref name="Mishra 2003" /> Korea,<ref name="Seok 2002" /> and Pakistan),{{Citation needed|date=December 2019|reason=removed citation to predatory publisher content}} the Caribbean (Cuba),<ref name="Pegler 1988" /> Australia, Europe, North America,<ref name="Dickinson 1982" /> and South America.<ref name="Menolli 2008" /> It acquired protected status in Hungary in 2005, making it a legal offense to pick it.<ref name="Siller 2006" /> Variety ''microspora'' is known from Venezuela,<ref name="Dennis 1961" /> while ''V.&nbsp;bombycina'' var. ''palmicola'' occurs in the [[DR Congo]].<ref name="Shaffer 1962" />

== Uses ==
The fruit bodies are [[edible mushroom|edible]], and usually considered of good quality. They have been called "excellent",<ref name="Jordan 2004" /> "tasty" with a "modest and pleasant flavor",<ref name="Bessette 1992" /> and "worth eating if found in large enough quantities".<ref name="Dickinson 1982" />

== In culture ==
[[Alexander H. Smith]] related a story of how unique circumstances led to the development of a local superstition about the species:
<blockquote>... the members of a family here in Ann Arbor were poisoned, some fatally, as the result of eating caps of a species of ''Amanita''. The next year ''Volvaria bombycina'' fruited on a maple tree at the home of these people, and the story was circulated that some of the spores of the poisonous fungus, which caused the deaths the year before, had escaped from the house, lodged in the tree, germinated, grew and were now producing fruiting bodies. Consequently the carpophores of the ''Volvaria'' were held in great awe by the neighbors, and soon came to be referred to as the "ghost mushroom". No one, of course, would consider eating them.<ref name="Smith 1945" /></blockquote>
