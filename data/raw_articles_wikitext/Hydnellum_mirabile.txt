'''''Hydnellum mirabile''''' is an inedible species of [[Hydnoid fungi|tooth fungus]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=324}}</ref> in the family ''[[Bankeraceae]]''. It is found in Europe and North America, where it grows in old-growth, coniferous forests on [[Base-richness|base-rich]] or [[Calcareous|chalky]] soils. It forms [[mycorrhiza]] with [[Picea abies|Norway spruce]] and occasionally [[Pinus sylvestris|Scots Pine.]] 

==Description==

[[Pileus (mycology)|Caps]] of ''Hydnellum mirabile'' are brownish to dark brown with yellow edges, and have a hairy surface. They are funnel-shaped. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] measures 10–50 by 10–25&nbsp;mm and is dark brown and hairy at the base. On the cap underside (the [[hymenium]]) hang brownish spines with paler tips. The [[basidiospore|spores]] are roughly spherical with [[tubercle]]s on the surface, and measure 5–7 by 4.5–6&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name="urlRogers" /> It has a weakly astringent taste. The [[spore print]] is [[buff (color)|buff]] brown.<ref name="urlRogers" />

==Conservation==

''Hydnellum mirabile'' faces significant conservation challenges across its range. The species is classified as [[vulnerable species|Vulnerable]] according to [[IUCN]] criteria due to substantial [[habitat loss]] and ongoing threats. Population assessments indicate fewer than 500 known localities throughout Europe, with the primary concentration in [[Fennoscandia]], where small populations typically consist of only 1–10 individuals per site. The total mature population is estimated at fewer than 5,000 individuals.

The species' decline directly correlates with the reduction of [[old-growth forest|old-growth]] spruce forests on productive, base-rich soils—habitats that have decreased by 30–50% over the past 50 years. This rare fungus forms [[mycorrhiza]]l associations primarily with [[Norway spruce]] (''Picea abies'') and occasionally with [[Scots Pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''), requiring specific ecological conditions that limit its distribution.

[[Clearcutting]] forestry practices pose the most significant threat to ''H.&nbsp;mirabile'', as the species disappears following such [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbances]] and appears unable to recolonise younger forest stands. In Central Europe, cumulative [[air pollution]]—particularly nitrogen deposition—further threatens remaining populations.<ref name="iucn"/>

Conservation status varies across the fungus's range, with ''H.&nbsp;mirabile'' listed as regionally extinct in the Czech Republic, [[endangered]] in France and Sweden, and [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] in Finland and Norway. Despite serving as an [[indicator species]] for [[biodiversity]] hotspots, few sites containing ''H.&nbsp;mirabile'' receive formal protection as nature reserves. Effective conservation will require the preservation of appropriate old-growth forest habitats, as this specialised fungus cannot survive under conventional [[forest management|forestry management]] regimes.<ref name="iucn"/>
