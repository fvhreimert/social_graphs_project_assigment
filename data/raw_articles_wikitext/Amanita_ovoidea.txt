The '''European white egg''' ('''''Amanita ovoidea'''''), '''bearded amanita''' or '''European egg amidella''', is a species of [[fungus]] of the genus ''[[Amanita]]'' in the family ''[[Amanitaceae]]''. It is a large, white-colored fungus, often tinged with [[Cream (colour)|cream]]. Native to [[Europe]], it is found on plains as well as mountains in the [[Mediterranean]] region. It is similar to some deadly [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1833 by [[Pierre Bulliard]], a French physician and botanist, and [[Lucien Quélet]], a French mycologist and naturalist.

==Description==
The mushroom is white to cream-coloured and can reach very large sizes, over {{Convert|15|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}}, or in exceptional cases over 30&nbsp;cm. The [[cap (mycology)|cap]] is smooth, fleshy, silky, hemispherical when young, but soon becoming convex to shield shaped. The cap margin is usually covered with hanging, cottony remains of the [[partial veil]]. The [[lamella (mycology)|lamella]]e are thick, rounded, broad and are free from the stipe. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is thick, cylindrical, powdery, has a fragile, cottony ring, and a large, white to ochraceous-cream [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base. The flesh is thick, white and has a strong, unpleasant smell. The [[spore print]] is white, and the elliptical [[basidiospore|spores]] measure 10–12 × 6.5–8 [[μm]].<ref>Galli R. 2007.

=== Similar species ===
''[[Amanita proxima]]'', a poisonous species containing [[allenic norleucine]], is very similar to ''A.&nbsp;ovoidea''. It is separated by the deep ochraceous to russet-orange colour of its volva, the persistent pendulous ring on the stipe, and the smooth cap margin, without vellar remains. ''A.&nbsp;proxima'' is found in the same habitats as ''A.&nbsp;ovoidea'', and can cause cytolytic [[hepatitis]] and [[acute renal failure]].<ref>Ducros J, Labastie J and Saingra S. (1995). Una observation supplementaire d’intoxication par Amanita proxima a  l’origine d’insuffisance renale aigue. Nephrologie, 16: 341.</ref>

It is also similar to all-white, deadly poisonous ''Amanita'' species such as ''[[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]]'' and ''[[Amanita verna|A.&nbsp;verna]]''.<ref name=":0" />

==Distribution and habitat==
Native to [[Europe]], it is found on plains as well as mountains in the [[Mediterranean]] region.

''Amanita ovoidea'' is a [[symbiotic]] fungus, forming [[mycorrhiza]]l associations with [[pine]] trees, as well as evergreen and deciduous [[oak]]s.<ref name="Roger">{{cite web | url = http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~6951~gid~~source~gallerydefault.asp | title = Amanita ovoidea | access-date = 2010-05-24 | work = Roger's Mushrooms | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101231093609/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~6951~gid~~source~gallerydefault.asp | archive-date = 2010-12-31 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=it&u=http://www.agraria.org/funghi/amanitaovoidea.htm&ei=d-n5S9yEOozaNueEmYQI&sa=X&oi=translate&ct=result&resnum=9&ved=0CD8Q7gEwCDgU&prev=/search%3Fq%3DAmanita%2Bovoidea%26start%3D20%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DN%26prmd%3Di | title = Amanita ovoidea (Bull.: Fr) | access-date = 2010-05-24 | work = Agraria}}</ref> It is found in [[coniferous forests]], [[deciduous forests]], coastal regions, mountains, roadsides and grassy areas,<ref name="Roger" /><ref name="tulloss">{{cite web|last=R E|first=Tulloss|title=Amanita ovoidea|url=http://pluto.njcc.com/~ret/amanita/species/ovoideas.html}}</ref> growing on limy, sandy and alkaline soils.<ref name="rdb">{{cite web|title=Amanita ovoidea|url=http://e-ecodb.bas.bg/rdb/en/vol1/Amaovoid.html|publisher=Red Data Book of Bulgaria}}</ref> The mushroom grows semi-buried in the ground, and collected specimens are often covered with sand.

==Conservation==
In Bulgaria, the species is in danger due to [[habitat loss]] caused by selective logging, human settlements and natural causes like acid rain and [[soil pollution]].<ref name="rdb" />

==Edibility==
The edibility of ''Amanita ovoidea'' is dubious. In the past, the fungus has been reported as "edible" in some books and "poisonous" in others.<ref name=":0" /> Moreover, it can easily be confused with other all-white, deadly poisonous ''Amanita'' species, such as ''A.&nbsp;virosa'', ''A.&nbsp;verna'' and, in particular, ''A.&nbsp;proxima''.<ref name=":0">{{cite web | url = http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&sl=es&u=http://www.fungipedia.es/clasificacion-orden/basidiomycetes/65-agaricales/162-amanita-ovoidea.html&prev=/search%3Fq%3DAmanita%2Bovoidea%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DN%26prmd%3Di&rurl=translate.google.com&twu=1&usg=ALkJrhgdO_UQP2djVC8YYii8dM_5mn-3OQ | title = Amanita ovoid | access-date = 2010-05-24 | last = Pérez Calvo200 | first = Javi | date = 2009-01-23 | work = Fungipedia}}</ref> In southern [[France]], some people were inflicted with [[acute kidney injury]] because they accidentally consumed ''A.&nbsp;proxima'', mistaking it for ''A.&nbsp;ovoidea''.<ref>de Haro L, Jouglard J, Arditti J, David JM.
