'''''Hydnellum concrescens''''' is an inedible [[fungus]], commonly known as the '''zoned hydnellum''' or '''zoned tooth fungus'''. As with other [[tooth fungi]], the spores are produced on spines on the underside of the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]], rather than [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]]. It has a funnel-shaped [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]], typically between {{convert|2|and|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, which has characteristic [[concentric]] zones of color. The cap may also have radial ridges extending from the center to the margins. The spines are pink in young specimens, but turn brown with age.

This species is very similar in appearance to ''[[Hydnellum scrobiculatum]]'', and traditionally, largely unreliable microscopic characteristics such as [[spore]] size and ornamentation have been used to distinguish between the two. Recent research has demonstrated a way to discriminate the two species using [[DNA sequencing]] of the [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS regions]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Parfitt D, Martyn Ainsworth A, Simpson D, Rogers HJ, Boddy L |title=Molecular and morphological discrimination of stipitate hydnoids in the genera ''Hydnellum'' and ''Phellodon'' |journal=Mycological Research |volume=111 |issue=Pt 7 |pages=761–77 |year=2007 |pmid=17681224 |doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2007.05.003 }}</ref>
