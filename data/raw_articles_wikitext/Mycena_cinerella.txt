'''''Mycena cinerella''''', commonly known as the '''mealy bonnet''', is an inedible species of [[mushroom]] in the family [[Mycenaceae]]. It is found in Europe and the United States, where it grows in groups on fallen leaves and needles under [[pine]] and [[Douglas fir]]. The small grayish mushrooms have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide atop [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]] that are {{convert|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick. Its [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are grayish-white and [[adnation|adnate]], with a "tooth" that runs slightly down the stipe. The fungus has both two- and four-spored [[basidium|basidia]]. As its [[common name]] suggests, it smells mealy.

==Taxonomy==
First called ''Agaricus cinerellus'' by Finnish mycologist [[Petter Karsten]] in 1879,<ref name=Karsten1879a/> he transferred it to the genus ''[[Mycena]]'' that same year.<ref name=Karsten1879b/> In his 1936 ''Flora Agaricina Danica'' (Agaric flora of Denmark) [[Jakob Emanuel Lange]] referred it to the genus ''[[Omphalia]]'';<ref name=Lange1936/> ''Omphalia cinerea'' (P. Karst.) J.E. Lange is now a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]].<ref name="urlFungorum synonymy: Mycena cinerella"/> ''Mycena cineroides'' was named and described as a new species distinct from ''M.&nbsp;cinerella'' by Hintikka in 1963, who thought it to be unique due to its narrowly acute cap that lacked brownish or yellowish tones, decurrent [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], and two-[[spore]]d [[basidium|basidia]].<ref name=Hintikka1963/> However, intermediate forms of it have been found, and some authorities, like Dutch ''Mycena'' specialist [[Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus|Maas Geesteranus]],<ref name=MaasGeesteranus1991/> believe it should be treated as a synonym of ''M.&nbsp;cinerella''.<ref name="url Aronsen"/>

The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "mealy bonnet".<ref name=BMS/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''cinerella'' means "somewhat ashy color".<ref name=Rea1922/>

==Description==
[[image:Mycena spec. - Lindsey 4b.jpg|thumb|left|There are 2–3 tiers of lamellulae interspersed between the gills.]]
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''M.&nbsp;cinerella'' is white and small, with a diameter typically ranging from {{convert|0.5|to|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Initially [[wikt:hemispherical|hemispherical]], [[wikt:obtuse|obtusely]] conic, and then convex, it expands during maturity, developing visible grooves on the surface that correspond to the gills underneath the cap.<ref name=Jordan2004/> The cap has a broad, flattened [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The cap surface is smooth and moist, with a slimy margin that is initially pressed against the stipe; with age the margin becomes notched and sometimes scalloped, turning translucent. The cap color is dark gray to pale gray, somewhat [[hygrophanous]], fading to ashy white or brown when dry. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, gray, [[wikt:cartilaginous|cartilaginous]] and tough, with a strongly [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] (mealy, similar to raw potatoes) odor and taste if crushed or chewed. The whitish to grayish [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are moderately broad (2–3&nbsp;mm) with a spacing that is close to subdistant, and 18–26 reach the stipe, interspersed with two or three tiers of lamellae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stipe). The stipe attachment is [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] or [[wikt:arcuate|arcuate]], but later develops a pronounced [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]] tooth. The decurrent tooth occasionally separates from the stipe, forming a collar around it. The stipe is {{convert|2|–|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1|–|2.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, equal in width throughout, hollow, cartilaginous, and brittle. The stipe surface is smooth or polished, with the apex initially faintly [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] (as if covered with a fine whitish powder). The base of the stipe is sparsely covered with sharp, straight, stiff hairs, and is the same color as the cap or paler.<ref name="Smith p.366-68">Smith, pp. 366–68.</ref> The mushroom is inedible.<ref name=Jordan2004/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
The [[spore]]s are 7–9 by 4–5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] (reaction very weak in some collections). The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, or occasionally a combination of two- and four-spored.<ref name="Smith p.366-68"/> The four-spored forms have [[clamp connection]]s that are absent in the two-spored forms.<ref name="url Aronsen"/> The [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] ([[cystidium|cystidia]] found on the face of the gills) are not differentiated. The [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] (cystidia found on the edges of the gills) are embedded in the [[hymenium]] and inconspicuous, measuring 22–36 by 5–11&nbsp;μm. They are roughly [[wikt:filiform|filiform]] (like thin filaments), with numerous contorted branches or protuberances, and club-shaped with finger-like prolongations. The flesh of the gills is [[wikt:homogeneous|homogeneous]], and turns [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]-brown when [[staining|stained]] in iodine. The flesh of the cap has a well-differentiated [[wikt:pellicle|pellicle]], with a differentiated but not very well-developed hypoderm, and [[hypha]]e that are 10–20&nbsp;μm wide.<ref name="Smith p.366-68"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Mycena cinerella'' is a [[saprobic]] fungus, that derives nutrients by decomposing [[forest floor|leaf litter]] and similar [[detritus]], converting it to [[humus]] and [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralizing]] organic matter in the soil. The fruit bodies grow in groups on needles under [[pine]] and [[Douglas fir]], typically in the late summer and autumn. In the United States, it has been collected from [[Michigan]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[California]].<ref name="Smith p.366-68"/> In Europe, it has also been collected from Great Britain,<ref name=Emmett1993/> Norway,<ref name="url Aronsen"/> Poland,<ref name=Holownia1985/> and Sweden.<ref name=Tyler1991/>
