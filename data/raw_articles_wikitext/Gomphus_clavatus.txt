'''''Gomphus clavatus''''', [[common name|commonly known]] as '''pig's ears''' or the '''violet chanterelle''', is an [[edible mushroom|edible]] species of fungus in the genus ''[[Gomphus (fungus)|Gomphus]]''. [[Species description|Described]] by [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] in 1774, ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' has had several name changes and many alternative scientific names, having been classified in the genus [[Cantharellus]] (also called chanterelles), though it is not closely related to them. The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] is vase- or fan-shaped with wavy edges to its rim, and grows up to {{convert|15-16|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide and {{convert|17|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} tall. The upper surface or [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is orangish-brown to [[Lilac (color)|lilac]], while the lower [[basidiospore|spore]]-bearing surface, the [[hymenium]], is covered in wrinkles and ridges rather than [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] or pores, and is a distinctive purple color.

Typically found in [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forests]] in Eurasia and North America, ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l and associated with various [[conifer]]s, particularly [[spruce]]s and [[fir]]s. It is more common at elevations of greater than {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=1}}, in moist, shady areas with plenty of [[leaf litter]]. Although widespread, ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' has become rare in many parts of Europe and extinct in the British Isles. It has been placed on the national [[Regional Red List|Red Lists]] of threatened fungi in 17 different European countries and is one of 33 species proposed for international conservation under the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]].

==Taxonomy==
German naturalist [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] described ''Elvela'' (subsequently ''[[Helvella]]'') ''purpurascens'' in 1774.<ref name="Schäffer 1774"/> Austrian naturalist [[Franz Xaver von Wulfen]] gave it the name ''Clavaria elveloides'' in 1781, reporting that it appeared in the [[Abies|fir]] tree forests around [[Klagenfurt]] in August and was common around [[Hüttenberg, Austria|Hüttenberg]]. He recorded that poor people ate it, giving it the local name ''hare's ear''.<ref name="Jacquin 1781"/> In 1796, mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] [[species description|described]] ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' as ''Merulius clavatus'', noting that it grew in grassy locations in woods. He noted it was the same species that Schäffer had described.<ref name="Persoon 1796"/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]]—derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''clava'' (club) and meaning "club-shaped"<ref name="Stearn 2004"/>—refers to the shape of young fruit bodies.<ref name="Roody 2003"/> In his 1801 ''Synopsis methodica fungorum'', Persoon placed ''Merulius clavatus'' (recognising two [[variety (botany)|varieties]]—''violaceus'' and ''spadiceus'') in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Gomphus'' within ''Merulius''.<ref name="Persoon 1801"/>

British botanist [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] used Persoon's name, transferring the violet chanterelle to the genus ''Gomphus'' in 1821.<ref name="Giachini 2011"/> As it was the first named member of the genus it became the [[type species]].<ref name="Giachini 2011"/> The starting date of fungal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] had been set as January&nbsp;1, 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]], which meant the name required [[sanctioned name|sanction]] by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid.  Thus the species was written as ''Gomphus clavatus'' (Pers.: Fr.) Gray. A 1987 revision of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] set the starting date at May&nbsp;1, 1753, the date of publication of the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', by [[Carl Linnaeus]].<ref name=Esser1994/> Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Gomphus clavatus"/> Persoon followed suit in treating ''Gomphus'' as a separate genus in his 1825 work ''Mycologia Europaea''.<ref name="Giachini 2011"/> Here he recognized ''M.&nbsp;clavatus'' as the same species as ''Clavaria truncata'' described by [[Casimir Christoph Schmidel]] in 1796, calling the taxon ''Gomphus truncatus''.<ref name="Persoon 1825"/>

Fries himself declined to keep the genus separate,<ref name="Giachini 2011"/> instead classifying ''Gomphus'' as a ''tribus'' ([[subgenus]]) within the genus ''Cantharellus'' in his 1821 work ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'', the species becoming ''Cantharellus clavatus''. He recognized four varieties: ''violaceo-spadiceus'', ''carneus'', ''purpurascens'' and ''umbrinus''.<ref name="Fries 1821"/> Swiss mycologist [[Louis Secretan]] described three [[taxa]]—''Merulius clavatus carneus'', ''M.&nbsp;clavatus violaceus'' and ''M.&nbsp;clavatus purpurascens''—in his 1833 work ''Mycographie Suisse''.<ref name="Secretan 1833"/> Many of his names have been rejected for [[nomenclature codes|nomenclatural]] purposes because Secretan had a narrow [[species concept]], dividing many taxa into multiple species that were not supported by other authorities, and his works did not use [[binomial nomenclature]] consistently.<ref name="Donk 1962"/><ref name="Demoulin 1974"/> Fries revised his classification in his 1838 book ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum'', placing it in a [[series (botany)|series]]—''Deformes''—in the genus ''Craterellus''.<ref name="Fries 1838"/>



[[Paul Kummer]] raised many of Fries' ''tribus'' (subgenera; not [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]]) to genus rank in his 1871 work ''Der Führer in die Pilzkunde'', classifying the violet chanterelle in the genus ''[[Thelephora]]''.<ref name="Kummer 1871"/> Jacques Emile Doassans and [[Narcisse Théophile Patouillard]] placed it in the genus ''Neurophyllum'' (also spelt ''Nevrophyllum'') in 1886,<ref name="Giachini 2011"/><ref name="Doassans 1886"/> removing it from ''Cantharellus'' on account of its orange spores. [[Charles Horton Peck]] discarded the name in 1887 and returned ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' to ''Cantharellus''.<ref name="Giachini 2004"/> In 1891, German botanist [[Otto Kuntze]] published ''[[Revisio generum plantarum]]'', his response to what he perceived as poor method in existing nomenclatural practice.<ref name="Kuntze"/> He coined the genus ''Trombetta'' to incorporate the violet chanterelle, hence giving it the name ''Trombetta clavata''.<ref name="Kuntze 1891"/> However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists.<ref name="Kuntze"/>

[[Alexander H. Smith]] treated ''Gomphus'' as a section within ''Cantharellus'' in his 1947 review of chanterelles in western North America, as he felt there were no consistent characteristics that distinguished the two genera.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> In 1966 [[E. J. H. Corner]] described a small-spored variety, ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' var. ''parvispora'', from specimens collected in [[Uganda]];<ref name="Corner 1966"/> it is not considered to have independent [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] significance.<ref name="urlFungorum: Gomphus clavatus var. parvisporus"/>

Research in the early 2000s combining the use of [[phylogenetic]] analyses of DNA sequences and more traditional [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]-based characters has resulted in a reshuffling of the species concept in ''Gomphus'';<ref name="Giachini 2004" /> as a result, ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' is considered the only ''Gomphus'' species in North America.<ref name="urlKuo: Gomphus"/> Comparison of the [[DNA sequence]]s of species ''Gomphus brevipes'' and ''G.&nbsp;truncatus'' has shown them to be genetically identical to ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'', and they may be treated as [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]].<ref name="Giachini 2004"/>

''Gomphus clavatus'' is commonly known as pig's ears, alluding to the violet underside and yellowish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]],<ref name="Persson 1997"/> although this vernacular name is also used for ''[[Discina perlata]]''.<ref name="Evenson 2015"/> Other English [[common name]]s for this species include clustered chanterelle and violet chanterelle.<ref name="Sept 2006"/> Gray coined the name clubbed gomphe.<ref name="Gray 1821"/> In the [[Sherpa language]] of Nepal the fungus is known as ''Eeshyamo'' ("mother-in-law"), as its imposing fruit body is reminiscent of a mother-in-law, who has a dominant role in a [[Sherpa people|Sherpa family]].<ref name="Giri 2009"/>

==Description==
]]

The [[basidiocarp]]s, or fruit bodies, of immature ''Gomphus clavatus'' are club-shaped and have one cap, but later spread out and have a so-called ''merismatoid'' appearance—several vase-shaped caps rising from a common stem. The fruit body is up to {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} tall<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/661/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, California |pages=661 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> and {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide; it is fan-shaped with wavy edges. The upper surfaces of the fruit bodies are covered with brown [[hypha]]e (microscopic filaments) that form small, distinct patches towards the margin, but combine to form a continuous felt-like fine-haired area, or [[Trichome#Plant trichomes|tomentum]], over the center of the cap. The color of the upper cap surface is orange-brown to violet, but fades to a lighter brown with age.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Gomphus clavatus"/> The cap margins of older mushrooms can be quite ragged.<ref name="Lamaison 2005"/> The lower spore-bearing surface—the hymenium—is wrinkled, often with folds and pits, and violet to brown in color. The solid [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], which is continuous with the cap,<ref name="Arora 1991"/> is {{convert|0.8–3|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide, {{convert|1–10|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} tall,<ref name="Smith 1947"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=125}}</ref> and covered with fine hairs that become coarser (hispid) towards the base. It is often compound, with several fruit bodies arising from the basal portion. Fruit bodies may bruise reddish-brown where handled.<ref name="urlKuo: Gomphus clavatus"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] can be whitish-pink to [[lilac (color)|lilac]] or cinnamon-buff. Thick under the center of the cap, it thins out towards the margins.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> It can be crunchy, though it is softer than that of the chanterelle.<ref name="Lamaison 2005"/> The taste and odor are mild. The [[spore print]] is yellow to orange-yellow.<ref name="Orr 1980"/>

The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are elliptical, wrinkled or slightly warted, and 10–14 by 5–7.5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Gomphus clavatus" /> They are [[nonamyloid]], meaning they have a negative [[color reaction]] with the [[iodine]] in [[Melzer's reagent]]. The spore-bearing structures, the [[basidia]], are elongated or club-shaped, [[hyaline]] (glassy or translucent), and four-spored, with dimensions of 60–90 by 8.5–11.5&nbsp;μm.<ref name="urlwww.mykoweb.com"/> ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' does not contain [[cystidia]], the sterile cells associated with basidia in many species. [[Clamp connection]]s are present.<ref name="urlwww.mykoweb.com"/>

== Conservation ==
In Europe, ''Gomphus clavatus'' appears on the national [[Regional Red List|Red Lists]] of threatened fungi in 17 countries and is one of 33 species of fungi proposed for international conservation under the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]].<ref name="Dahlberg 2006"/> Due to a substantial decline in sightings,<ref name="Siller 2005"/> ''Gomphus clavatus'' became a legally protected species in Hungary on September 1, 2005.<ref name="Siller 2006"/> It also has legal protection in [[Slovakia]]<ref name="Dahlberg 2006"/> and Slovenia.<ref name="Petkovsek 2004"/> The species formerly occurred in the British Isles, but has not been seen since 1927 and is now regarded as extinct.<ref name=BritishChecklist/> The fungus faces [[habitat loss|loss]] and degradation of its habitat; [[Eutrophication#Terrestrial ecosystems|eutrophication]] (increased [[nitrate]]s in the soil) is another potential threat.<ref name="Dahlberg 2006"/> ''Gomphus clavatus''  was selected as the 1998 ''Pilz des Jahres'' ("Mushroom of the Year") by the [[Deutschsprachige Mykologische Gesellschaft|German Mycological Society]], partly to highlight its vulnerable status.<ref name="DGFM"/>

==Edibility==

''Gomphus clavatus'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]]; it is rated as choice by some,<ref name="Orr 1980"/><ref name="Smith 1980"/> while others find it tasteless<ref name="Davis 2012"/> or experience [[Indigestion|gastric upsets]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=246}}</ref> It has an earthy flavor and meaty texture that has been regarded as suiting red meat dishes.<ref name="Kuo 2007"/> Like many edible fungi, consumption may cause gastrointestinal distress in susceptible individuals.<ref name="urlKuo: Gomphus clavatus"/> The flesh becomes bitter with age,<ref name="Orr 1980"/> and older specimens may be infested with insects.<ref name="Davis 2012"/> Insect infestation is unlikely if the weather is cool.<ref name="Smith 1980"/> ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' has been used for cooking for some time; Fries included it in his 1867 book ''Sveriges ätliga och giftiga svampar'' (''Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms in Sweden''). It is highly regarded by the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec people]] of [[Ixtlán de Juárez]] in [[Oaxaca]], Mexico,<ref name="Garibay 2007"/> and the Sherpa people in the vicinity of [[Sagarmatha National Park]] in Nepal.<ref name="Giri 2009"/>

[[Extract]]s prepared from ''G.&nbsp;clavatus'' fruit bodies have a high antioxidant activity,<ref name="Makropoulou 2012"/> and a high concentration of [[phenols|phenolic]] and [[flavonoid]] compounds.<ref name="Sarikurkcu 2015"/> Phenolic compounds identified from the fungus include [[protocatechuic acid]], [[gallic acid]], [[gentisic acid]], [[vanillic acid]], [[syringic acid]], [[cinnamic acid]], [[caffeic acid]], [[ferulic acid]], and [[tannic acid]].<ref name="Puttaraju 2006"/>  In a chemical analysis of collections from the south [[Aegean Region]] of Turkey, the fungus was shown to have [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulated]] the toxic metal [[cadmium]] to levels exceeding the maximum intake recommended by the European Union [[Scientific Committee on Food]].<ref name="Sarikurkcu 2015"/>
