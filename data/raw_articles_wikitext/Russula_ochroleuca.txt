'''''Russula ochroleuca''''' is a member of the genus ''[[Russula]]''. A group that have become known as '''brittlegills'''. It has been [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''common yellow russula''' for some years, and latterly the '''ochre brittlegill'''. It is widespread, and common in mixed woodland.

==Taxonomy==
''Russula ochroleuca'' was first noted and named as a species of ''[[Agaricus]]'' by the pioneering South African mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801.

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is dull yellow and {{convert|5|–|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, initially convex, later flat, or slightly depressed. The cap margin becomes furrowed when mature, and it is two-thirds peeling. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white to greyish white, and are adnexed.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book| author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref> The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|3|–|7|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1|–|2|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, cylindrical, white or later greyish. The taste is mild to moderately hot.

It could be confused with the similar-looking and much better tasting ''[[Russula claroflava]]''.

==Distribution and habitat==
'''''Russula ochroleuca''''' grows in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous forest]], where it (at least in Northwestern Europe) is very common. In the USA it is fairly common under conifers; [[birch]], and [[aspen]] in the Northern States.<ref name=Arora2nd>{{cite book |author=David Arora |year=1986 |title=Mushrooms Demystified |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=0-89815-169-4 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsdemysti00aror_0 }}</ref>
