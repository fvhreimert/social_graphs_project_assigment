==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[Species description|described]] as ''[[Agaricus]] luteus'' in 1788<ref>{{Cite web |title=Species Fungorum - Agaricus luteus Bolton, Hist. fung. Halifax (Huddersfield) 2: 50, tab. 50 (1788) |url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=490275 |access-date=2022-07-12 |website=www.speciesfungorum.org}}</ref> by the English mycologist [[James Bolton]] who described an observation from a hothouse near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], three years earlier in 1785.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last=Bolton |first=James |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/25501#page/172/mode/1up |title=An history of fungusses, growing about Halifax ... |date=1788 |publisher=Printed for the author and sold in Halifax by him |volume=1 |location=[Huddersfield, Eng.] |page=50}}</ref> Bolton also provided an illustration of the mushrooms.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bolton |first=James |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/25501#page/243/mode/1up |title=An history of fungusses, growing about Halifax ... |date=1788 |publisher=Printed for the author and sold in Halifax by him |volume=1 |location=[Huddersfield, Eng.] |page=Plate 50 (Illustration)}}</ref> At the time gilled species were classified as ''Agaricus'' and ''luteus'' comes from the Latin for yellow or yellow-orange.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Botanical Latin (L) & Greek (G) |url=https://www.palomarcactus.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Botanical-Latin-Glossary.pdf}}</ref> Bolton suggested the common name of 'Yellow Cottony Agaric' in reference to the soft, scaly texture of the mushroom.<ref name=":3" />

However the name ''A.&nbsp;luteus'' had already been used to describe an unrelated ''[[Russula]]'' species and was published in 1778 by [[William Hudson (botanist)|William Hudson]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Species Fungorum - Agaricus luteus Huds., Fl. Angl., Edn 2 2: 611 (1778) |url=http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=179338 |access-date=2022-07-12 |website=www.speciesfungorum.org}}</ref> so Bolton's ''A.&nbsp;luteus'' was [[Nomen illegitimum|illegitimate]].

Nonetheless ''Agaricus luteus'' continued to be used and in [[James Sowerby]]'s 1796 book entitled '''Coloured figures of English fungi or mushrooms''<nowiki/>' his description of ''Agaricus cepaestipes'' (now ''[[Leucocoprinus cepistipes]]'') also includes ''A.&nbsp;luteus'' and ''A.&nbsp;cretaceus'' (now ''[[Leucocoprinus cretaceus]]'') which he considered to be 'undoubtedly the same species', only differing in colour.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sowerby |first=James |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/28621#page/13/mode/1up |title=Coloured figures of English fungi or mushrooms |date=1797 |publisher=Printed by J. Davis |location=London |page=1 |via=www.biodiversitylibrary.org}}</ref> So whilst his illustration of ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii'' is intricately drawn, coloured and immediately recognisable today it rather confusingly has the yellow and white species side by side.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sowerby |first=James |url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=uykWAAAAYAAJ&pg=GBS.PP14&hl=en_GB |title=Coloured Figures of English Fungi Or Mushrooms |date=1797 |publisher=J. Davis |language=en}}</ref>

Sowerby writes that his observations of this species were made in bark beds around London where he described its presence as 'not uncommon'. He does not explicitly state that the observations were made in greenhouses however he does note that the yellow mushrooms were observed at [[Sir Abraham Hume, 2nd Baronet|Sir Abraham Hume]]'s [[Wormleybury]] manor. During this period exotic plants from the East Indies and India were being cultivated in greenhouses and stove-heated hothouses at Wormleybury making it likely that this is where the mushrooms were found.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rowe |first=Anne |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUUE0XTqrWoC&q=wormleybury+exotic&pg=PA67 |title=Hertfordshire Garden History: A Miscellany |date=2007 |publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press |isbn=978-1-905313-38-9 |language=en}}</ref> This may give an indication as to where the fungi observed originated from.

In 1897 the French mycologist [[Julien Godfrin]] described the species as sulphur yellow in colour and classified it as ''Lepiota lutea.''<ref>{{Cite web |title=Species Fungorum - Lepiota lutea Godfrin, Bull. Soc. mycol.

In 1839 the Czech mycologist [[August Carl Joseph Corda|August Corda]] described the same species from [[Prague]] where it was found growing in a greenhouse in between pineapple plants by a garden inspector named Birnbaum and so he called it ''Agaricus Birnbaumii''.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Corda |first=August Karl Joseph |url=https://bibdigital.rjb.csic.es/idurl/1/11086 |title=Icones fungorum hucusque cognitorum.

The French mycologist [[Marcel Locquin]] classified it as ''Leucocoprinus luteus'' in 1945<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Locquin |first=Marcel |date=1945 |title=Notes sur les Lépiotes II (suite) |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/linly_0366-1326_1945_num_14_5_13215 |journal=Publications de la Société Linnéenne de Lyon |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=89–100 |doi=10.3406/linly.1945.13215}}</ref> and the German mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] reclassified it as ''Leucocoprinus birnbaumii'' in 1962.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Singer |first=Rolf |date=1962 |title=Diagnoses Fungorum novorum Agaricalium II |url=https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/Sydowia_15_0045-0083.pdf |journal=Sydowia |volume=15 |pages=67}}</ref>

===English names===
In the UK, ''Leucocoprinus birnbaumii'' has been given the recommended [[common name]] of "plantpot dapperling".<ref name = Holden/> In North America, it has also been called the "yellow parasol",<ref name="Arora"/> "flowerpot parasol",<ref name="Arora"/> "yellow houseplant mushroom",<ref name="Volk"/> "lemon-yellow lepiota",<ref name=Lincoff1981/> or "yellow pleated parasol".<ref name=McKnight1987/>

==Description==
''Leucocoprinus birnbaumii'' is a small, yellow dapperling mushroom. The fruit bodies are [[agaric]]oid (mushroom-shaped) and occur singly or in small clumps.

'''[[Pileus (mycology)|Cap]]:''' 2.5–6&nbsp;cm wide in maturity,<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/302/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=302 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> starting bulbous to cylindrical before expanding to hemispherical or conical and flattening or sometimes appearing umbonate with age. The surface is lemon yellow to sulphur yellow, smooth or slightly powdery and covered in ragged, fibrous scales which are easily removed. The scales are darker yellow or brownish with age and more densely concentrated towards the centre disc where they often form a patch whilst at the edges they are sparser. The cap edges are striated and grooved (sulcate-striate) with a paler colour present in the grooves whilst the edges curl inwards when young before curving out with age or straightening. The cap flesh is firm when young but becomes softer and more fragile with age, it is a dull whitish colour.

'''[[Lamella (mycology)|Gills]]:''' Free and often quite remote from the stem, sulphur yellow, with spacing that can vary from crowded to subdistant at up to 4mm wide. With age the gills may bulge in the middle (ventricose) and the edges can be fringed.

'''[[Stipe (mycology)|Stem]]:''' 3–10&nbsp;cm long and 1.5–5&nbsp;mm thick<ref name="Arora1986" /> at the top tapering to a bulbous or club shaped base which is 4–15mm thick. The interior is hollow but pithy with a shiny white colour whilst the exterior surface is lemon yellow to sulphur yellow and may discolour brownish with age. It is covered in fine powdery or woolly scales (pruinose to floccose-squamulose) across the full length starting from just above the base. The thin, membranous stem [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] is located anywhere between the top and bottom of the stem (superior to inferior) and is movable. The top surface of it is yellow whilst the underside is whitish however the ring is evanescent and may disappear. '''Spore print:''' White.

'''[[Spore]]s:''' Ellipsoid to amygdaliform with a large [[germ pore]]. [[Dextrinoid]]. The average size range is 7.7–10.5 x 5.9–7.3 [[μm]].

'''Smell:''' Indistinct or sometimes mushroomy.

=== Sclerotia ===
One feature of ''L. birnbaumii'' which is frequently visible are the [[Sclerotium|sclerotia]] amongst the mycelium on the surface of the soil, which is an unusual trait amongst members of the ''[[Agaricales]]''.<ref name="sclerotialist">{{Cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Matthew E. |last2=Henkel |first2=Terry W. |last3=Rollins |first3=Jeffrey A. |date=January 2014 |title=How many fungi make sclerotia? |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266913869 |journal=Fungal Ecology |volume=13 |page=6 |doi=10.1016/j.funeco.2014.08.010 |issn=1754-5048}}</ref> The Italian mycologist Oreste Mattirolo described sclerotia in ''Lepiota flos-sulphuris'' in 1917 as well as in a species which he described as ''Lepiota incerta.''<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mattirolo |first=Oreste |date=1918 |title=Sul Ciclo di Sviluppo di due Specie Scleroziate del Gen.

Accademia dei Lincei, Serie Quinta |volume=XII |issue=XI |pages=537–572 |via=www.biodiversitylibrary.org}}</ref> In 1948 by the Czech mycologist [[Karel Cejp]] reclassified these species as ''Leucocoprinus flos-sulphuris'' and ''Leucocoprinus flos-sulphuris var. incerta'', with both now regarded as synonyms of ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii''.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal |last=Cejp |first=Karel |date=1948 |title=Dva tropičtí zástupci bělohnojniků v našich sklenicích. |url=http://www.czechmycology.org/_cm/CM023.pdf |journal=Česká Mykologie |language=cs |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=78 |via=www.czechmycology.org}}</ref> Cejp also cites an earlier description of the sclerotia by the German mycologist [[Paul Christoph Hennings]] in 1898 who noted sclerotia in the hothouses of [[Heinrich Hildmann|Heinrich Hildmann's]] cacti gardens in [[Birkenwerder]]. However due to the confusion in the early taxonomy of ''Leucocoprinus'' species Hennings describes them as belonging to ''L.&nbsp;cepaestipes'', despite describing the mushrooms as golden yellow. Hennings describes the sclerotia as small (barely 1mm), light yellow and felt-like, with them covering entire areas of plant pots and beds. Hennings concludes that the species was likely introduced from South America citing specimens of sclerotia in the Berlin herbarium that were collected from Guadeloupe.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hennings |first=P. |url=https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/Verh-Bot-Ver-Berlin-Brandenburg_40_0109-0177.pdf |title=Die in den Gewächshäusern des Berliner botanischen Gartens beobachteten Pilze. |year=1898 |pages=35 |language=DE}}</ref>  Hennings compares them to ''Sclerotium mycetospora'', which was described in 1822 by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as being like mustard seeds which were white, furry and spread gregariously amongst the bark in a hothouse where they appeared to favour the light.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fries |first=Elias |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/25490#page/259/mode/1up |title=Systema mycologicum : sistens fungorum ordines, genera et species, huc usque cognitas, quas ad normam methodi naturalis determinavit |date=1821 |publisher=Ex Officina Berlingiana |volume=2 |location=Lundae |pages=253}}</ref>

Typically sclerotia are most often discussed in the context of [[truffle]]s or in the challenges faced by attempts at [[Morchella#Cultivation|morel cultivation]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gamillo |first=Elizabeth |date=2022-05-02 |title=Danish Biologists Cultivate Morel Mushrooms Year-Round With New Indoor Technique |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/danish-biologists-find-technique-to-cultivate-morel-mushrooms-year-round-180980007/ |access-date=2022-07-12 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |language=en}}</ref> so are usually associated with large, hardened masses growing under the ground. The sclerotia in ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii'' however are tiny (500-820 μm) hard, elliptical masses on top of the soil amongst the fibrous mycelium which have been described as whitish-beige or pale yellowish white. These have been shown to be genetically identical to the developed mushroom<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Matsuzawa |first1=Tetsuhiro |last2=Horie |first2=Yoshikazu |last3=Yaguchi |first3=Takashi |last4=Sakamoto |first4=Yumiko |last5=Fukiharu |first5=Toshimitu |date=2011 |title=Economic damage to cyclamen growth by sclerotia of Leucocoprinus birnbaumii |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjom/52/1/52_jjom.H22-05/_article/-char/en |journal=Japanese Journal of Mycology |volume=52 |issue=1 |pages=jjom.H22–05 |doi=10.18962/jjom.jjom.H22-05}}</ref> and have previously been cultured to produce mushrooms by introducing them to a substrate of sterilised wheat [[chaff]] before introducing the subsequently developed mycelium to a sand, peat, soil and sphagnum moss mix to ultimately fruit.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Warcup |first1=J.H. |last2=Talbot |first2=P.H.B. |date=1962 |title=Ecology and identity of mycelia isolated from soil |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0007-1536(62)80010-2 |journal=Transactions of the British Mycological Society |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=495–518 |doi=10.1016/s0007-1536(62)80010-2 |issn=0007-1536|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Whilst ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii'' itself is harmless to plants the sclerotia can have economic impacts on the production and sale of [[Orchid]]s which often have transparent root pots where the sclerotia can collect.

== Habitat and distribution ==
Like all ''[[Leucocoprinus]]'' species, ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii'' is a [[saprotroph]], living on very decayed plant matter (humus or compost). The fungus is common throughout the [[tropics]] and [[subtropic]]s, extending into warmer parts of the [[temperate]] zones. Rarely, it appears in cooler areas, fruit bodies having been recorded as far north as England,<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Legon NW, Henrici A |title=Checklist of the British & Irish Basidiomycota |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens |location=Kew, UK |year=2005 |page=517 |isbn=1-84246-121-4 |url=http://www.basidiochecklist.info/}}</ref> but these seem to be temporary introductions. In these areas (such as North America, Europe, and Australia) it is more usually found in hothouses and plant pots than in the wild.<ref name=":4" /><ref name="Volk"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Kuo, M.

''Leucocoprinus birnbaumii'' is a [[Mushroom poisoning|toxic mushroom]].<ref name=":2" /> If eaten it can cause [[gastroenteritis]]-like symptoms.<ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last1=Bazzle |first1=Lisa J |last2=Cubeta |first2=Marc A |last3=Marks |first3=Steven L |last4=Dorman |first4=David C |date=16 December 2014 |title=Feasibility of flotation concentration of fungal spores as a method to identify toxigenic mushrooms |journal=Veterinary Medicine: Research and Reports |volume=6 |pages=1–9 |doi=10.2147/VMRR.S67794 |pmc=6067785 |pmid=30101091 |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Leucocoprinus birnbaumii, Plant Pot Dapperling, identification |url=https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/leucocoprinus-birnbaumii.php |access-date=2022-07-13 |website=www.first-nature.com}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> [[North Carolina State University]] classifies the species as having medium severity poison characteristics<ref>{{Cite web |title=Leucocoprinus birnbaumii (Flowerpot Parasol, Lemon-Yellow-Lepiota, Plantpot Dapperling, Yellow Houseplant Mushroom, Yellow Pleated Parasol) &#124; North Carolina Extension Gardener Plant Toolbox |url=https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/leucocoprinus-birnbaumii/}}</ref> whilst the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] say that the level of toxicity is simply unknown at present.<ref>{{Cite web |last=jdlanier |date=2021-09-03 |title=Greenhouse Updates: September 3, 2021 |url=https://ag.umass.edu/greenhouse-floriculture/greenhouse-updates-september-3-2021 |access-date=2022-07-13 |website=Center for Agriculture, Food, and the Environment |language=en}}</ref>

==Chemistry==
The yellow color of the mushrooms is from a pair of [[indole alkaloid]]s known as [[birnbaumins]]. Birnbaumin B is the major alkaloid component and has the formula {{chem2|C16H20N6O5}} whilst birnbaumin A has one less oxygen atom. Extraction methods used to isolate these compounds also yield [[Tryptophan|L-tryptophan]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Bartsch |first1=Andrea |last2=Bross |first2=Monika |last3=Spiteller |first3=Peter |last4=Spiteller |first4=Michael |last5=Steglich |first5=Wolfgang |date=2005-05-06 |title=Birnbaumin A and B: Two Unusual 1-Hydroxyindole Pigments from the "Flower Pot Parasol" ''Leucocoprinus birnbaumii'' |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |language=en |volume=44 |issue=19 |pages=2957–2959 |doi=10.1002/anie.200500082 |pmid=15818629 |bibcode=2005ACIE...44.2957B |issn=1433-7851|doi-access=free }}</ref>

A 2015 study succeeded in isolating a number of fatty acids from ''Leucocoprinus birnbaumii'' which showed moderate but selective anti-microbial effects. Three fatty acid compounds were isolated and tested against six [[microorganism]]s. Of them, [[linoleic acid]] displayed some inhibition against ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' and less against ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[oleic acid]] had some inhibition of ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' whilst [[methyl linoleate]] had limited inhibition against all three bacteria species. They did not show any results against the other two bacteria they were tested against ([[Escherichia coli|''E.&nbsp;coli'']] and [[Mrsa|MRSA]]) or against the pathogenic yeast strain ''[[Candida albicans]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Brkljača |first1=Robert |last2=Urban |first2=Sylvia |date=2014-05-01 |title=Rapid Dereplication and Identification of the Bioactive Constituents from the Fungus, ''Leucocoprinus birnbaumii'' |journal=Natural Product Communications |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=1934578X1501000 |doi=10.1177/1934578x1501000124 |s2cid=19265437 |issn=1934-578X|doi-access=free }}</ref>

== Relationship with potted plants ==

''Leucocoprinus birnbaumii'' is a common find in greenhouses and potted plants all over the world having been spread by human activity.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Observations - Leucocoprinus birnbaumii |url=https://www.inaturalist.org/observations?subview=map&taxon_id=85398 |access-date=2022-07-12 |website=iNaturalist |language=en}}</ref> When Europeans started exploring the tropics and bringing back exotic plant species for study or cultivation they were unwittingly bringing fungal hitchhikers back with them in the soil. The original classification of this species from a greenhouse in England in the late 1700s<ref name="Bolton" /> and the observation from the early 1800s<ref name="Roberts&Evans" /> in Prague which gave it the name ''birnbaumii'' demonstrate how long this species has been present in Europe. Despite this tropical species likely being unable to survive in these countries in the wild due to the cold temperatures it continues to spread via human activity. The heat and humidity of greenhouses or indoor plant pots evidently creates a habitat in which this species can thrive with garden centres and nurseries serving as hubs to distribute ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii'' all over Europe. Botanical gardens may serve as another means of spreading as visitors unknowingly collect spores on their clothes and bring them into their homes.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last1=Szczepkowski |first1=Andrzej |last2=Gierczyk |first2=Błażej |last3=Kujawa |first3=Anna |date=2014-08-01 |title=Greenhouses of botanical gardens as a habitat of alien and native macrofungi: a case study in Poland |journal=Open Life Sciences |language=en |volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=777–795 |doi=10.2478/s11535-014-0310-5 |s2cid=17510324 |issn=2391-5412|doi-access=free }}</ref>

However, when ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii'' mushrooms suddenly appear in a plant pot which had shown no previous signs of them it doesn't mean the fungus has only just been introduced. Due to the length of time the [[mycelium]] requires to grow, it is more likely that the fungus was always present in the soil from the moment the plant (or compost used) was acquired and that the conditions for it to fruit have only recently been met. Mushroom production will occur when the moisture content of the soil and humidity of the air is adequate. Even when no mushrooms are visible the fungus may still be alive and thriving in the soil waiting for the next opportunity to fruit.

As a [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] species ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii'' is harmless to plants. The presence of this fungus in the soil may serve to improve the quality of it as it can help to break down organic matter and provide nutrients that the plants require.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Volk |first=Tom |date=February 2002 |title=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for February 2002 |url=https://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/feb2002.html |website=Tom Volk's Fungi Department of Biology University of Wisconsin-La Crosse}}</ref> However, if the mushrooms are appearing regularly it can be a sign that the soil is too moist and that the plant may be being over-watered. Whilst ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii'' itself is harmless to plants, the high moisture conditions in which it fruits can invite a host of other fungi and mold species which may harm the plant and result in root rot. In this regard ''L.&nbsp;birnbaumii'' can serve as a useful indicator to help ensure plants remain healthy.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-29 |title=Are Mushrooms Bad for Houseplants? - Indoor Plants for Beginners |url=https://www.indoorplantsforbeginners.com/are-mushrooms-bad-for-houseplants/ |access-date=2022-07-13 |language=en-US}}</ref>
