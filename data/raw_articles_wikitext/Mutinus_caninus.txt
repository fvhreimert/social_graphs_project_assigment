'''''Mutinus caninus''''', commonly known as the '''dog stinkhorn''',<ref name=BritishNames/><ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> is a small thin, phallus-shaped [[woodland]] fungus, with a dark tip. It is often found growing in small groups on wood debris or in [[leaf litter]] during summer and autumn in Eurasia and eastern North America. It is not generally considered [[edible mushroom|edible]], but there are reports of the immature 'eggs' being consumed.

==Taxonomy==
The genus name ''Mutinus'' was a phallic deity, [[Mutinus Titinus]] (known to the Greeks as [[Priapus]]), one of the Roman ''[[di indigetes]]'' placated by Roman brides,<ref name=Arora1986/>  and ''caninus'' means "dog-like" in [[Latin]].<ref name=Simpson1979/> ''Mutinus'' is the [[diminutive]] of ''muto'', a [[Classical Latin|Latin]] word for [[Penis]]. It was described initially by [[William Hudson (botanist)|William Hudson]] (1730–1793), a noted British botanist. Its common names in French, ''Phallus de Chien'', ''Satyre des chiens'', also hint at its resemblance to a [[dog penis]]. It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "dog stinkhorn".<ref name=BritishNames/>

==Description==

This small member of the family [[Phallaceae]] emerges from an off-white egg-like fruiting body that lies half buried in [[leaf litter]] on the woodland floor. White [[mycelial cord]]s (rhizomorphs), are often visible beneath this 'egg', which is {{convert|2–4|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high, and {{convert|1–2|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=Laessoe1998/> The 'egg' has a tough outer skin (peridium), which covers a gelatinous inner layer, which in turn protects the fully formed, but unexpanded fruiting body. When the ‘egg’ splits open the fungus expands rapidly (usually within a few hours), to its full height of {{convert|10–12|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. It is around {{convert|1|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} thick, and is either yellowish-white, yellow, or pale orange. The split egg is retained as a volva-like sack, at the base. The column is very fragile, pitted, and cylindrical. It has a pointed tip, and is usually curved. The tip is covered in the [[spore]] bearing matter ([[gleba]]) which is a dark olive-brown paste, and has a smell which is irresistible to insects. (These insects help distribute the spores on their bodies, and in their stomachs.) Beneath the spore mass the tip is dark orange. Although its smell is not as strong as the related common stinkhorn (''[[Phallus impudicus]]''), it has been described as smelling like cat faeces.<ref name=Zeitl976/>

American mycologist [[Sanford Myron Zeller]] described an albino form of the fungus based on collections made in [[Warrengon, Oregon]]. It is essentially identical to the regular form but pure white throughout, except for the gleba.<ref name=Zeller1944/> This form, named ''M.&nbsp;caninus'' var. ''albus'', was first mentioned in the scientific literature by [[Edward Angus Burt]] in 1896.<ref name=Burt1896/>

===Similar species===
''[[Mutinus ravenelii]]'' is pinker in coloration, with a red tip. It is a rarer American species, now spreading in Europe.<ref name=Laessoe1998/>  Another North American species ''[[Mutinus elegans]]'' is very similar to ''M.&nbsp;ravenelii'', and is short and stocky, with a more pointed apex.

==Distribution and habitat==
The dog stinkhorn is found occasionally and is quite common in Europe, [[British Islands|Britain]], and eastern North America.<ref name=Arora1986/> The fungus is listed in the [[Regional Red List|red data list]] of Ukraine.<ref name=Sarkina2003/> A collection from the [[Canary Islands]] was noted as the southernmost collection for the species in the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name=Beltran1998/> It has also been collected in Iran,<ref name=Saber1986/> Turkey,<ref name=Demirel2004/> and China, including [[Hebei]], [[Jilin]], and [[Guangdong]].<ref name=Zhishu1993/> It appears from summer to late autumn, and is usually found in small groups; in [[leaf litter]]; on wood debris, or wooded roadsides. It may occur in both [[deciduous]], and [[conifer]]ous woods. The fruit bodies of the fungus can serve as a food source for [[thief ants]] and developing blow flies (''[[Phormia regina]]'').<ref name=Stoffolano1990/>

==Edibility==
The dog stinkhorn is probably [[edible mushroom|edible]] at the 'egg' stage, but it is not recommended. At least one report from in the eastern United States strongly recommends the 'eggs' peeled and fried as a tasty dish.<ref name=Arora1986/>
