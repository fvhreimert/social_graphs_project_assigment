Formerly '''''Russula mairei''''' (Singer), and [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''beechwood sickener''', the now re-classified fungus '''''Russula nobilis''''' (Velen.)<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips. | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms| publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page=19}}</ref> is a [[basidiomycete]] [[mushroom]] of the genus ''[[Russula]]''. This group of mushrooms are noted for their brittle gills and bright colours.

==Taxonomy==
It was previously named in honour of French mycologist [[René Maire]] by [[Rolf Singer]] in 1929, but found to be the same taxon as the earlier 1920 ''Russula nobilis'', which has naming priority.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is a red or rosy colour, 3–6&nbsp;cm wide, convex to flat, or slightly depressed, and weakly sticky. It peels only to a third of its radius, which reveals pink flesh.<ref name=Phillips06/> The flesh is firm and white or sometimes yellowish, smells of coconut, and tastes peppery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.monaconatureencyclopedia.com/russula-mairei/?lang=en|title = Russula mairei|date = 7 August 2008}}</ref> It is often damaged by slugs. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is 2–5&nbsp;cm long, 1–1.5&nbsp;cm wide, cylindrical, (firmer than its conifer dwelling namesake, ''[[Russula emetica]]''), and white. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are narrowly spaced, adnexed, rounded, and white, often with a faint blue-green sheen. The [[spore print]] is white.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is [[mycorrhizal]] with beech (''[[Beech|Fagus]]'') in woodland areas.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Thomas Laessoe. | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref> It is widespread and common in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], and [[North America]], where these trees grow.

==Edibility==
''Russula nobilis'' is inedible, and probably poisonous in quantity, but not deadly. Many bitter tasting red-capped species can cause problems if eaten raw; the symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: [[diarrhoea]], vomiting and [[colic]]ky abdominal cramps. The active agent has not been identified but thought to be caused by chemical compounds known as [[sesquiterpene]]s, which have been isolated from the related genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'' and from ''[[Russula sardonia]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benjamin| first= Denis R. |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas — a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians|url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomspoisons0000benj|url-access=registration|publisher=WH Freeman and Company| location=New York |year=1995| isbn=0-7167-2600-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/mushroomspoisons0000benj/page/369 369]}}</ref>
