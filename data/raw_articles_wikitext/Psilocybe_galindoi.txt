'''''Psilocybe galindoi''''' is a [[psychedelic mushroom]] in the section Mexicana, having [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as its main active compounds. It is also known as ''Psilocybe galindii''. The species was named in honor of Mr. Carlos Galindo Arias and his family by Dr. [[Gastón Guzmán]].

==Description==
*'''Cap''': 1.9 – 2&nbsp;cm in diameter, [[conic]] to [[wikt:campanulate|campanulate]] or [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]], with a very slight [[Plant cuticle|papilla]], [[glabrousness (botany)|glabrous]], even to striate when moist, [[hygrophanous]], brown or yellowish brown fading to pale [[ochraceous]] or straw color. Staining blue-green where injured.
*'''Gills''': [[Adnation|Adnate]], brown to dark purple brown, with whitish edges.
*'''Stipe''': 5 — 6.5&nbsp;cm x 1 – 2&nbsp;mm, equal, hollow, no annulus, reddish brown in the middle, darker towards the base with long [[rhizomorphic]] strands. Veil inconspicuous, except for some white appressed silky fibrils on the pileus.
*'''Spores''': Dark purple gray in deposit. (8.1)9.6 — 12(14) x 7.1 — 8 [[μm]], [[subrhomboid]] in face view or [[subellipsoid]] in side view(around 1 [[μm]]), yellowish brown, thick walled with a broad germ pore.
*'''Odor''': [[Farinaceous]]
*'''Taste''': [[Farinaceous]]
*''' Microscopic Features''': Basidia: 18 — 24 x 7.2 — 9.6 [[μm]], [[hyaline]], 4-spored, [[ventricose]]. [[Pleurocystidia]]: 14.4 — 21 x 7 — 8.4 [[μm]], hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous, with short necks.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Psilocybe galindoi'' is found growing [[gregarious]]ly in soil at higher elevations and in tall grass in or near ''[[Pinus]]''-''[[Quercus]]'' (pine with oak) forests in [[Mexico]]. The holotype location is Pie de la Cuesta, Jalisco, Mexico - a bit south of Guadalajara.

==Consumption and cultivation==
 ]]
Like several other [[psilocybin mushrooms]] in the [[genus]], a mushroom going under the name ''Psilocybe galindoi'' has been consumed by indigenous North American and Central American peoples for its [[entheogen]]ic effects.   This is a misidentification, as the mushroom they are cultivating is ''Psilocybe tampanensis''{{Dubious|Misidentified...Tampanensis??|date=December 2020}}, and the real ''Psilocybe galindoi'' is a synonym of ''Psilocybe mexicana''.

In the Western world, [[sclerotia]] of a mushroom misidentified as ''Psilocybe galindoi'' are sometimes cultivated for [[entheogenic]] or medicinal use. The sclerotia usually have a lower content of active substances than the actual mushrooms themselves.
