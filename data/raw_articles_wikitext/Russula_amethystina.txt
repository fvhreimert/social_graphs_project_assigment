'''''Russula amethystina''''' is a conspicuous mushroom, which appears sporadically from mid-summer until the autumn under [[spruce]] and [[fir]] trees. In [[Northern Europe]], it is very rare. It is not easy to distinguish from similarly coloured ''[[Russula]]'' species, and practically identical to ''[[Russula turci]]''. 

==Description==
The cap ranges from 3 to 12&nbsp;cm in diameter and varies in colour between violet, lilac, wine-red and wine-red-brown. The cap skin can be pulled off from the edge, right to the centre. The gills are from cream to bright yellow. The spores are yellow, subglobose, with small warts.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The hollow stipe ranges from 3 to 6 cm in length and 1 to 2 cm in width; it is initially white, later becoming yellowish or brownish.<ref name=":0" />

Similar species include ''[[Russula turci]]'', which may smell like iodine near the base of the stalk;<ref name=":0" /> otherwise it can only be distinguished by microscopic differences in [[spore]] texture. ''R. lilacea'' and ''R. murrillii'' are also similar.<ref name=":0" />
