'''''Sarcodon squamosus''''' is a species of [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] in the genus ''[[Sarcodon]]''.

== Description ==
It is an edible mushroom that was previously regarded as a subspecies of ''[[Sarcodon imbricatus]]''. For many years, ''S. imbricatus'' was described associated with both spruce and pine, although the latter forms were smaller and noted to be more palatable by mushroom hunters in Norway. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis of the DNA revealed the two forms to be distinct genetically, and thus populations of what had been described as ''S.&nbsp;imbricatus'' were now assigned to ''Sarcodon squamosus'', which includes collections in the British Isles and the Netherlands.The mushroom often grows in large [[fairy ring]]s near [[pine heath]]s and in rocky flat soil. The cap is {{Convert|10 to 25|cm|frac=2}} wide,<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |pages=122}}</ref> shallowly funnel-shaped. The color is white, turning brownish-purple with age.<ref name="tfb" /> The [[pileipellis]] has dark scales that are placed in concentric circles. They belong to growing areas with old trees where both the forest type and the growth type have a long continuity and they do not withstand complete felling.

== Edibility and uses ==
When young, the smell is pleasant and the taste is mild; older mushrooms may taste bitter.<ref name="Luontoportti" /> It can be cooked and mixed with other mushrooms, and stored in oil or [[cider vinegar]].<ref name="tfb" />

From the point of view of [[Natural dye|mushroom dyeing]], it is significant as one of the only mushroom species that can dye with shades of blue.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pertti Salo, Tuomo Niemelä, Ulla Salo|date=2006|isbn=951-0-30359-3|location=Helsinki|publisher=WSOY : Luonnontieteellinen keskusmuseo, kasvimuseo|title=Suomen sieniopas}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref> Brown shades are obtained from young mushrooms, while older, almost mature ones give rarer shades of blue, turquoise and green.<ref name="Luontoportti">{{cite web|access-date=2017-11-25|title=Luontoportti: Männynsuomuorakas ''Sarcodon squamosus''|url=http://www.luontoportti.com/suomi/fi/sienet/mannynsuomuorakas}}<!-- auto-translated by Module:CS1 translator --></ref>
