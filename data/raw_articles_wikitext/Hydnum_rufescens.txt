'''''Hydnum rufescens''''', commonly known as the '''terracotta hedgehog''', is an edible [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycete]] of the family [[Hydnaceae]]. It belongs to the small group of mushrooms often referred to as the [[tooth fungus|tooth fungi]], which produce [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit bodies]] whose [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] undersurfaces are covered by [[hymenophore]]s resembling spines or teeth, and not pores or [[lamella (mycology)|gills]].

It is very similar to the more common hedgehog fungus (''[[Hydnum repandum]]''), and was previously sometimes considered a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of that species.  However, the following differences have been noted:<ref>Roger Phillips: ''Mushrooms and other fungi of Great Britain & Europe'' (1981), Pan Books Ltd, London.</ref><ref name="Courtecuisse">Courtecuisse, R. & Duhem, B. (1994) "Guide des champignons de France et d'Europe" Delachaux et Niestlé {{ISBN|2-603-00953-2}}, also available in English.</ref>

*the cap of ''H. rufescens'' is russet rather than beige,
*the overall dimensions are smaller and more regular in shape, with a central [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]],
*the spines are not [[decurrent]], and
*the [[spore]]s are slightly larger.

Both species are found in European [[coniferous]] and [[deciduous]] forests growing on soil. It is reportedly [[ectomycorrhiza]]l with ''[[Picea abies]]'', ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'', ''[[Fagus sylvatica]]'' and ''[[Quercus robur]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=''Hydnum rufescens'' | publisher=The Ecology of Commanster | url=http://popgen.unimaas.nl/~jlindsey/commanster/Mushrooms/Basidio/SuBasidio/Hydnum.rufescens.html | accessdate=September 1, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509061208/http://popgen.unimaas.nl/~jlindsey/commanster/Mushrooms/Basidio/SuBasidio/Hydnum.rufescens.html | archive-date=May 9, 2008 | url-status=dead }}</ref>
