'''''Flammulina filiformis''''', commonly called '''enoki mushroom''', is a species of [[Edible mushroom|edible]] [[agaric]] (gilled mushroom) in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Physalacriaceae]]. It is widely cultivated in East Asia, and well known for its role in [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]] and [[Chinese cuisine]]. Until recently, the species was considered to be [[conspecific]] with the European ''[[Flammulina velutipes]]'', but [[DNA sequencing]] has shown that the two are distinct.<ref name="Wang">{{cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Pan Meng |last2=Liu |first2=Xiao Bin |last3=Dai |first3=Yu Cheng |last4=Horak |first4=Egon |last5=Steffen |first5=Kari |last6=Yang |first6=Zhu L. |display-authors=3 |title=Phylogeny and species delimitation of ''Flammulina'': taxonomic status of winter mushroom in East Asia and a new European species identified using an integrated approach |journal=Mycological Progress |date=September 2018 |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=1013–1030 |doi=10.1007/s11557-018-1409-2 |bibcode=2018MycPr..17.1013W |s2cid=49299638 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325826280}}</ref>

==Etymology==

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the mushroom is known as ''enoki-take'' or ''enoki-dake'', both meaning "[[Celtis sinensis|hackberry]] mushroom". This is because it is often found growing at the base of hackberry (''enoki'') trees.

In Mandarin [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the mushroom is called ''jīnzhēngū'' ({{lang|zh-hans|{{linktext|金針菇}}}} "gold needle mushroom") or ''jīngū'' ([[wiktionary:金|金]][[wiktionary:菇|菇]] "gold mushroom").

In [[Korean language|Korean]], it is called ''paengi beoseot'' (팽이버섯) which means "mushroom planted near [[catalpa]]". In [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] it is known as ''nấm kim châm''. In India it is called [http://www.chhattisgarhrecipes.com/2017/01/futu-long-mushroom.html?m=1 ''futu''].

== Description ==
[[Basidiocarps]] are [[agaricoid]] and grow in clusters. Individual [[fruit bodies]] are up to {{Convert|50|mm|abbr=off|frac=4}} tall, the cap convex at first, becoming flat when expanded, up to {{Convert|45|mm|abbr=on|frac=4}} across. The cap surface is smooth, viscid when damp, ochraceous yellow to yellow-brown. The [[lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] (gills) are cream to yellowish white. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (stem) is smooth, pale yellow at the apex, yellow-brown to dark brown towards the base, and lacking a ring. The [[spore print]] is white, the spores (under a microscope) smooth, [[inamyloid]], ellipsoid to cylindrical, c. 5 to 7 by 3 to 3.5μm.<ref name="Wang" />

There is a significant difference in appearance between [[Wildlife|wild]] and [[Fungiculture|cultivated]] basidiocarps. Cultivated enokitake are not exposed to light, resulting in white or pallid fruit bodies with long stipes and small caps.

== Taxonomy ==
''Flammulina filiformis'' was originally described from China in 2015 as a [[Variety (botany)|variety]] of ''[[Flammulina velutipes|F. velutipes]]'', based on [[internal transcribed spacer]] sequences.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.13346/j.mycosystema.150080 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280696631 |journal=Mycosystema |volume=34|issue=4 |page=600 |date=2015|title=Species diversity of ''Flammulina'' in China: new varieties and a new record|author1=Z.W. Ge |author2=Kuan Zhao |author3=Zhu L. Yang }}</ref> Further molecular research using a combination of different sequences has shown that ''F. filiformis'' and ''F. velutipes'' are distinct and should be recognized as separate species.<ref name="Wang" />

=== Improved storaging ===
''F''. ''filiformis'' extract can be added to whipped cream. It was observed that this measure helps to slow down the development of ice crystals, which would maintain the quality of whipped cream longer while storing it in a frozen state.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Arai |first1=Naoki |last2=Fujiwara |first2=Ayako |last3=Wakuda |first3=Michiyo |last4=Fujimoto |first4=Toshihiro |last5=Nambu |first5=Yuko |last6=Ishii |first6=Toya |last7=Matsumiya |first7=Kentaro |last8=Matsumura |first8=Yasuki |last9=Kawahara |first9=Hidehisa |last10=Ogino |first10=Koji |date=February 2021 |title=Anti-freeze effect of Enoki mushroom extract on the quality preservation of frozen whipped cream |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0260877420303733 |journal=Journal of Food Engineering |language=en |volume=291 |article-number=110285 |doi=10.1016/j.jfoodeng.2020.110285|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

=== Nutritionally improved meat products ===

''F. filiformis'' are an object of interest in current research for their potential to enhance food products and animal feed by using the stem waste.

Studies indicate that the addition of ''F. filiformis'' stem waste powder to meat products can improve nutritional quality by increasing dietary fiber and ash content.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Banerjee |first1=Dipak Kumar |last2=Das |first2=Arun K. |last3=Banerjee |first3=Rituparna |last4=Pateiro |first4=Mirian |last5=Nanda |first5=Pramod Kumar |last6=Gadekar |first6=Yogesh P. |last7=Biswas |first7=Subhasish |last8=McClements |first8=David Julian |last9=Lorenzo |first9=Jose M. |date=2020-04-04 |title=Application of Enoki Mushroom (Flammulina Velutipes) Stem Wastes as Functional Ingredients in Goat Meat Nuggets |journal=Foods |language=en |volume=9 |issue=4 |page=432 |doi=10.3390/foods9040432 |doi-access=free |issn=2304-8158 |pmc=7231162 |pmid=32260391}}</ref> This ingredient also enhances tenderness, inhibits lipid and protein oxidation, and extends shelf life, without negatively impacting the texture or flavor of the meat products.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Xuping |last2=Xu |first2=Mingying |last3=Cheng |first3=Jingrong |last4=Zhang |first4=Wei |last5=Liu |first5=Xueming |last6=Zhou |first6=Pengfei |date=August 2019 |title=Effect of Flammulina velutipes on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of Cantonese sausages |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0309174018311331 |journal=Meat Science |language=en |volume=154 |pages=22–28 |doi=10.1016/j.meatsci.2019.04.003|pmid=30981131 |url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kang |first1=G.H. |last2=Kim |first2=S.H. |last3=Kim |first3=J.H. |last4=Kang |first4=H.K. |last5=Kim |first5=D.W. |last6=Seong |first6=P.N. |last7=Cho |first7=S.H. |last8=Park |first8=B.Y. |last9=Kim |first9=D.H. |date=January 2012 |title=Effect of Flammulina velutipes on spent-hen breast meat tenderization |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S003257911940179X |journal=Poultry Science |language=en |volume=91 |issue=1 |pages=232–236 |doi=10.3382/ps.2011-01624|pmid=22184449 }}</ref>

=== Feed additive for livestock ===
Natural [[feed additive]]s have become more important in [[livestock]] farming. Following this trend, ''F.'' filiformis was checked for livestock health and production efficiency improving properties. There are studies showing that the use of Enoki mushroom residue as a feed additive offers several benefits for livestock. It enhances antioxidant enzyme activity, and improves animal digestibility, hormone levels, and immunity.

The addition of mushroom residue in the livestock diet can reduce the feed cost and feed conversion ratio and enhance the meat quality, providing consumers with healthier and higher-quality meat products.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Long |first1=Yong |last2=Xiao |first2=Wen |last3=Zhao |first3=Yanpin |last4=Yuan |first4=Chao |last5=Wang |first5=Defeng |last6=Yang |first6=Yang |last7=Su |first7=Chaozhi |last8=Paengkoum |first8=Pramote |last9=Han |first9=Yong |date=2024-01-24 |title=Effects of Flammulina velutipes mushroom residues on growth performance, apparent digestibility, serum biochemical indicators, rumen fermentation and microbial of Guizhou black goat |journal=Frontiers in Microbiology |volume=15 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2024.1347853 |doi-access=free |issn=1664-302X |pmc=10848151 |pmid=38328420}}</ref>

== Cultivation and harvest ==

The common way to cultivate ''F. filiformis'' is in a large-scale factory style. By using modern possibilities to mechanize processes, over 300'000 tons a year of ''F. filiformis'' can be harvested that way.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lu |first1=Yuan-Ping |last2=Chen |first2=Ren-Liang |last3=Long |first3=Ying |last4=Li |first4=Xiao |last5=Jiang |first5=Yu-Ji |last6=Xie |first6=Bao-Gui |date=2016-11-28 |title=A Jacalin-Related Lectin Regulated the Formation of Aerial Mycelium and Fruiting Body in Flammulina velutipes |journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences |language=en |volume=17 |issue=12 |page=1884 |doi=10.3390/ijms17121884 |doi-access=free |issn=1422-0067 |pmc=5187758 |pmid=27916794}}</ref>

=== Indoor cultivation ===
''F. filiformis'' thrive in a warm, moist environment during the incubation phase, with substrate temperatures ranging from 18 to 25&nbsp;°C (64 to 77&nbsp;°F). ''F. filiformis'' need significantly cooler conditions to trigger fruiting. Pinning is triggered at temperatures ranging between 7 and 10&nbsp;°C (45 and 50&nbsp;°F), and the optimal temperature range for fruiting is 10 to 16&nbsp;°C (50 to 61&nbsp;°F). As with most fungi, ''F. filiformis'' also demand elevated humidity levels—95 to 100% during pinning and 85 to 95% during fruiting.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sayner |first=Adam |date=2024-12-01 |title="GroCycle". The Ultimate Guide to Enoki Mushrooms. |url=https://grocycle.com/enoki-mushrooms/}}</ref>

The ideal size to harvest enoki mushrooms is generally recommended to be about 2-4 inches in length. At that time, the cap of ''F. filiformis'' should still be tightly closed and the stem should be long and sturdy. If people grow enoki mushrooms at home, they can use a sharp knife or scissors to snip off the mushroom cluster at the base of the stem where it meets the growing medium. It's important to remove both the mushrooms and any remaining mycelium (the white, thread-like structures) from the growing medium during harvest. This helps prevent decaying, which could negatively impact future mushroom growth.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=2024-12-01 |title="Mushrology". Enoki Mushrooms Cultivation: Grow Tips & Tricks. |url=https://mushroology.com/enoki-mushrooms/}}</ref>

=== Post-harvest handling ===

''F. filiformis'' have thin, delicate stems that need to be handled with care to prevent damage. The following steps are for reference. First, gently brush off any dirt or substrate with a soft brush or a damp cloth. After cleaning, separate the mushroom clusters into individual stems for easier cooking and presentation.<ref name=":0" />

=== Storage ===
''F. filiformis'' should be kept at temperatures between 7-10&nbsp;°C (44.6-50&nbsp;°F) for optimal freshness. For brief storage (fewer than 7 days), a temperature interval of 1-2&nbsp;°C (34-36&nbsp;°F) with 90-98% relative humidity is advised.<ref name=":0" />

=== Proneness to ''Listeria'' ===
''F. filiformis'' have the potential to be contaminated with ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', which is why disease control centers recommend cooking the mushroom upon consumption.

The Singapore Food Agency advise people to do the following to ensure food security when consuming ''F. filiformis:''

# Enoki mushrooms should never be eaten raw
# Instead, make sure to cook the mushrooms properly before eating them
# If there are cooking directions at hand, make sure to follow them
# Enoki mushrooms should be stored at cold temperatures to ensure a slower growth of microbes. This should be done even if the packaging is not opened yet
# Uncooked enoki mushroom should be stored separately to avoid cross-contamination<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dr Yong Quan |first=Tan |date=2023-02-16 |title=Safe Practices when Handling and Consuming Enoki Mushroom |url=https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-safety-tips/food-risk-concerns/risk-at-a-glance/enoki-mushrooms}}</ref>
