'''''Lactarius argillaceifolius''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Russulaceae]]. The mushrooms have convex to flattened drab [[lilac (color)|lilac]]-colored [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are up to {{convert|18|cm|abbr=on}} wide. The cream-colored [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are closely spaced together and extend slightly down the length of the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], which is up to {{convert|9|cm|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|3.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick. The mushroom produces an off-white [[latex]] when injured that stains the tissue brownish.

The [[variety (biology)|variety]] ''megacarpus'', with caps up to {{convert|27|cm|abbr=on}} wide, occurs under [[coast live oak]] and [[tanoak]] in the [[Pacific Coast]] states and [[Baja California]]. Variety ''dissimilis'', described on the basis of a single specimen from [[South Carolina]], differs from the main form in the microscopic structure of the [[cap cuticle]]. The European species [[Lactarius trivialis|''L.''&nbsp;''trivialis'']] is similar, but can be distinguished by differences in habitat and color differences in the gills, cap, and latex.

''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' is found in eastern North America and has also been found in pine plantations in Brazil, where it is probably an [[introduced species]]. Its edibility is unknown but is possibly [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by American mycologists [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]] in their 1979 [[monograph]] on the North American species of ''Lactarius''.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The [[type specimen]]—collected by Smith from [[Oak Grove, Livingston County, Michigan]], in July 1972—is housed at the [[University of Michigan Herbarium]].<ref name="urlUofMichHerb"/> Hesler and Smith simultaneously published the [[variety (botany)|varieties]] ''dissimilis'' and ''megacarpus'', collected from [[South Carolina]] and [[California]], respectively.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The variety ''megacarpus'' is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "vulgar milkcap".<ref name=Arora1986/>

Smith and Hesler classified ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' in [[subgenus]] ''Tristes'', in stirps ''Argillaceifolius''. This grouping of related species, which includes ''[[Lactarius fumaecolor|L.&nbsp;fumaecolor]]'', is characterized by the gelatinous cuticle of the stem.<ref>Hesler and Smith (1979, [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/f/fung1tc/aac3719.0001.001/376?page=root;rgn=mainheader;sid=c9eed00f57eb4cae87faf520e74fdb71;size=100;view=image;rgn1=citation;q1=aac3719 p.&nbsp;364]).</ref>

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|4–20|cm|abbr=on}} wide, and initially convex to broadly convex before flattening out with a depressed center. The cap margin is curved inward, and often remains that way into maturity. The cap surface is covered with fine soft hairs when young, but later becomes smooth; it is slimy and sticky when wet. The color of the cap ranges from [[lilac (color)|lilac]]-brown when young, fading to lilac-[[tan (color)|tan]] or pale lilac-gray and eventually to pale tan or pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]] at the center. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached to slightly decurrent (extending somewhat down the length of the stem), broad, and closely packed together. They are [[cream (color)|cream]]-colored when young, and later develop pinkish tones near the margin. In maturity, they become flushed with brownish-orange. The color stains buff to olive-brown to dark brown when bruised.<ref name=Bessette2009/><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=93–94|oclc=797915861}}</ref>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3–15|cm|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1–5|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick, and nearly equal in width throughout or tapering downward.<ref name=":0" /><ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=172}}</ref> Its surface may be slimy or dry, depending on the moisture in the environment. It is whitish, but in age becomes spotted with brownish stains. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, and white to buff. Its odor is not distinctive, while its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid. The [[latex]] is creamy-white on initial exposure, and stains the gills grayish-brown to dark brown or olive-brown; its taste is mild or slowly becomes slightly acrid.<ref name=Bessette2009/> Older fruit bodies tend to have less abundant and weaker-tasting latex.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The [[spore print]] is yellowish<ref name="audu" /> to pinkish-buff. The edibility of ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' is unknown.<ref name=Bessette2009/> The cap surface will turn yellow to orange when a drop of dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] is applied.<ref name=Guevara1987/>

===Microscopic characteristics===


The [[spore]]s are roughly spherical to broadly elliptical, and measure 7–11 by 7–8&nbsp;[[μm]]. They are ornamented with warts and ridges that sometimes form a partial [[wikt:reticulum|reticulum]] (a pattern of interconnected ridges), with prominences up to 1&nbsp;μm high. The spore are [[hyaline]] (translucent) and [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning that they will absorb [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] of young specimens is made of a tissue type known an ixotrichoderm, which contains gelatinized [[hypha]]e of different lengths arranged in roughly parallel fashion. As the mushroom matures, the cap cuticle gradually becomes an ixolattice—characterized by branching, entangled, gelatinous hyphae.<ref name=Bessette2009/> The [[basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, and measure 45–52 by 9–10.5&nbsp;μm. The [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are abundant, and relatively long—between 60 and 140&nbsp;μm long by 6–14&nbsp;μm thick. The [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] (cystidia on the gill edge) measure 32–67 by 6–9&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Hesler1979/>

===Varieties===
''Lactarius argillaceifolius'' var. ''dissimilis'', a variety reported from South Carolina, is nearly identical in appearance, but it has white latex that tastes bitter then acrid. The structure of the [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] differs from the nominate variety in that it has dextrinoid (staining yellowish or reddish brown with Meltzer's reagent) incrustations on the hyphae.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The variety ''megacarpus'' has a larger cap, up to {{convert|27|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide with flesh that is up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, and white and unchanging latex with an acrid taste. Its stem measures {{convert|16|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|4|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide near the top.<ref name=Hesler1979/> Microscopically, the spores of var. ''megacarpus'' are more reticulate than the nominate variety.<ref name=Bessette2009/>

''Lactarius argillaceifolius'' var. ''megacarpus,'' commonly known as the vulgar milk cap, is a [[Variety (botany)|variety]] reported from [[Oregon]], [[California]], and [[Baja California]]. It has been known to grow under [[Quercus agrifolia|coast live oak]] and [[Notholithocarpus|tanoak]] trees. Its [[latex]] is off-white, and stains fungal tissue brown to brownish, and its spore print is whitish to buff.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lactarius argillaceifolius var. megacarpus (MushroomExpert.Com) |url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/lactarius_argillaceifolius_megacarpus.html |access-date=2023-09-07 |website=www.mushroomexpert.com}}</ref> Its edibility is unknown, but it may be [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].<ref name="Arora1986" />

===Similar species===


''[[Lactarius trivialis]]'' is a European species that is similar in appearance to ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'', and they are often confused for each other.<ref name=McKnight1987/> ''L.&nbsp;trivialis'' can be distinguished by gills that stain brown when exposed to the latex, and a preference for growing in conifer- and birch-rich boreal and subalpine forests.<ref name="urlKuo"/> Variety ''megacarpus'' may be confused with ''[[Lactarius pallescens|L.&nbsp;pallescens]]'', a smaller paler-colored species with latex that stains gills lilac rather than brown.<ref name="urlCalifornisFungi"/>

Additionally, ''[[Lactarius hibbardiae|L. hibbardiae]]'' has a zonate cap, ''[[Lactarius kauffmanii|L.&nbsp;kauffmanii]]'' has a tan to gray pileus, and ''[[Lactarius uvidus|L.&nbsp;uvidus]]'' stains purple.<ref name="audu" />

==Habitat and distribution==
Like all ''[[Lactarius]]'' species, ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l. The fruit bodies of ''Lactarius argillaceifolius'' grow scattered or in groups on the ground under hardwoods, especially [[oak]], from July to October. It is often one of the first mycorrhizal mushrooms to fruit in forests dominated by oak and hickory.<ref name="urlKuo"/> The fruit bodies are slow to develop and are long-lasting.<ref name=Hesler1979/> The species is found from eastern Canada south to [[Florida]], and west to [[Minnesota]] and [[Texas]].<ref name=Bessette2009/> It is common in northeast Mexico.<ref name=Guevara1987/> The mushroom has also been reported from southern Brazil (state of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]]) growing in association with pine (''[[Pinus elliottii]]'') plantations, where it has probably been [[introduced species|introduced]] with pine seedlings brought by settlers.<ref name=Giachini2000/> ''L.&nbsp;argillaceifolius'' var. ''megacarpus'' has been collected from [[Baja California]],<ref name=Candusso1994/> California, Oregon, and Washington,<ref name=Bessette2009/> where it grows in association with [[coast live oak]] and [[tanoak]].<ref name="urlKuo"/>
