'''''Lactarius deliciosus''''', commonly known as the '''delicious milk cap''',<ref name="Arora">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/68/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |page=68 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> '''saffron milk cap''', or '''red pine mushroom''', is one of the best-known members of the large milk-cap genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'' in the order [[Russulales]]. It is native to Europe, but has been accidentally introduced to other countries along with pine trees, with which the fungus is [[symbiotic]].

== Taxonomy ==
The species was known to [[Carl Linnaeus]], who [[species description|officially described]] it in the second volume of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753, giving it the name ''Agaricus deliciosus''.<ref name="Linnaeus1753" /> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from [[Latin]] ''deliciosus'', meaning "tasty".<ref name="Simpson1979" /> The Swedish taxonomist allegedly gave the species its epithet after smelling it and presuming it tasted good, perhaps confusing it with a Mediterranean milk cap regarded for its flavor.<ref name="Wassson1968" /> Dutch mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] added the varietal epithet ''lactifluus'' in 1801, before English mycologist [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] placed it in its current genus, ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'', in 1821 in his ''The Natural Arrangement of British Plants''.<ref name="Gray1821" />

It is commonly known as saffron milk-cap, red pine mushroom, or simply pine mushroom in English. An alternative North American name is orange latex milky.<ref name="Fergus2003" /> Its Spanish name varies ({{wikt-lang|es|níscalo}}, ''nícalo'', {{wikt-lang|es|robellón}}...).<ref name="MacM1976" /> Its [[Catalan language|Catalan]] name is {{wikt-lang|ca|rovelló}} (pl. ''rovellons''). In the [[Girona]] area, it is called a {{wikt-lang|ca|pinetell}} (in Catalan) because it is collected near wild [[pine]] trees; it is typically harvested in October following the late August rains. Both this and ''[[Lactarius deterrimus|L.&nbsp;deterrimus]]'' are known as "kanlıca", "çıntar" or "çam melkisi" in Turkey.<ref name="Sol99" /><ref name="Gez00" /> In [[Romania]], it is known as ''Rascovi'' and it can be found in the northern regions in autumn season.

==Description==
''Lactarius deliciosus'' has a carrot-orange [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is convex to vase shaped, inrolled when young, {{convert|3 to 20|cm|frac=2|abbr=off}} across,<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |page=173}}</ref><ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |page=169}}</ref> often with darker orange lines in the form of concentric circles. The cap is sticky and viscid when wet, but is often dry. It has crowded [[decurrent]] gills and a squat orange [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] that is often hollow, {{convert|2 to 8|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name="audu" /> The flesh and gills stain a deep green color when handled.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=94–95|oclc=797915861}}</ref><ref name="Arora" /> When fresh, it exudes an orange-red [[latex]] that does not change color.<ref name="audu" /> The [[spore print]] is [[Cream (colour)|cream]]-coloured.<ref name="Arora" />

=== Chemistry ===

When grown in liquid culture, the [[mycelium]] produces a mixture of [[fatty acid]]s and various compounds such as chroman-4-one, anofinic acid, {{Nowrap|3-hydroxyacetylindole}}, [[ergosterol]], and cyclic [[dipeptide]]s.<ref name="Ayer 1994" />

=== Similar species ===
The mushroom is similar to ''[[Lactarius rubrilacteus|L.&nbsp;rubrilacteus]]'', which stains blue and exudes a red latex.<ref name="Miller20062">{{cite book |last1=Miller Jr. |first1=Orson K. |title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi |last2=Miller |first2=Hope H. |publisher=[[FalconGuide]] |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1 |location=Guilford, CN |page=89}}</ref> It also resembles ''[[Lactarius olympianus|L.&nbsp;olympianus]]'', which has white latex and tastes unpleasant.<ref name=":0" /> Additionally, ''[[Lactarius salmonicolor|L.&nbsp;thyinos]]'' is orange but does not stain greenish, and ''[[Lactarius salmoneus|L.&nbsp;salmoneus]]'' has a white cap.<ref name="audu" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
''L. deliciosus'' grows under [[conifer]]s on [[acidic soil]]s and forms a [[mycorrhiza]]l relationship with its host tree.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Paul W. |last2=Jump |first2=Alistair S. |date=2023-03-21 |title=Edible fungi crops through mycoforestry, potential for carbon negative food production and mitigation of food and forestry conflicts |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |language=en |volume=120 |issue=12 |article-number=e2220079120 |doi=10.1073/pnas.2220079120 |doi-access=free |pmid=36913576 |pmc=10041105 |bibcode=2023PNAS..12020079T |issn=0027-8424}}</ref> It is native to the southern [[Pyrenees]] where it grows under Mediterranean pines, as well as throughout the Mediterranean basin in [[Portugal]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Spain]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Cyprus]], [[France]] and elsewhere. Both this fungus and ''L.&nbsp;deterrimus'' are collected and sold in the [[İzmir Province]] of southwestern Turkey, and the [[Antalya Province]] of the south coast.<ref name="Sol99" /><ref name="Gez00" /> In the island of [[Cyprus]], large numbers of ''L.&nbsp;deliciosus'' are found in the high altitude ''[[Pinus nigra]]'' and ''[[Pinus brutia|P.&nbsp;brutia]]'' forests of the [[Troodos Mountains|Troodos]] mountain range, where locals hunt them with vigour, as this fungus is highly esteemed among the local delicacies.<ref>Loizides, M. (2008). A secret world: The fungi of Cyprus. Field Mycology 9 (3): 107-109. {{doi|10.1016/S1468-1641(10)60420-3}}.</ref>

After [[molecular phylogenetics|analysing DNA]] from collections around the world, mycologists Jorinde Nuytinck, Annemieke Verbeken, and Steve Miller have concluded that ''L.&nbsp;deliciosus'' is a distinct European species that differs genetically, morphologically, and ecologically from populations in North America or Central America.<ref name="Nuytinck 2007" /> It has been reportedly introduced to [[Chile]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], where it grows in ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' plantations. The species has also been introduced to South Africa. In Australia, popular places for collecting this mushroom, especially among [[Polish Australians|the Polish community]], are around [[Macedon, Victoria|Macedon]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Mount Crawford (South Australia)|Mount Crawford]] in the [[Adelaide Hills]] and in the [[Oberon, New South Wales|Oberon]] area in [[New South Wales]], Australia, where they can grow to the size of a dinner plate, and in the pine forests of the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. Many people of Italian, [[Poland|Polish]], [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and other eastern European ancestry in the states of Victoria and New South Wales, Australia travel to collect these mushrooms after autumn rainfall around Easter time.

[[Tree plantation|Pine plantations]] and Siberian pine forests are favourable habitats for this species.

==Uses==


''L. deliciosus'' is an [[edible mushroom]],<ref name="Miller2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|page=88}}</ref> but may taste mild or bitter;<ref name=":0" /> its misleading epithet, ''deliciosus (''<nowiki/>'delicious'), may have been caused by Linnaeus mistaking it for another species.<ref name="Wassson1968" /> The mushrooms are collected from August to early October, traditionally being salted or pickled.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |title=All That the Rain Promises and More: A Hip Pocket Guide to Western Mushrooms |publisher=10 Speed Press |date=February 1, 1991 |isbn=978-0-89815-388-0}}</ref>{{verification needed|date=July 2025}} High consumption of the species may cause urine to discolor to orange or red.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Kunzfeld |first=M |date=1953 |title=Temporary report on urine discoloration and antibiotic effect after eating Lactarius deliciosus L |journal=Munch Med Wochenschr |volume=95 |issue=8 |pages=235–6 |pmid=13072328}}</ref>

It is widely collected in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], especially in [[Catalonia]]. It is used in [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Catalan cuisine]]. One recipe recommends they should be lightly washed, fried whole cap down in [[olive oil]] with a small amount of [[garlic]] and served drenched in raw olive oil and [[parsley]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} Only a very small amount of [[butter]] is recommended in the pan.<ref name="Arora" />

This mushroom is also very popular in [[Russia]], usually salted.<ref name="Arora" />

Further north and east it is a feature of [[Provence|Provençal]] cuisine.<ref name=Olney1995/> They are also collected in Poland, where they are traditionally served fried in butter, with cream, or marinated. In [[Cyprus]], saffron milk caps are usually grilled on the charcoal and then dressed in olive oil and lemon or [[bitter orange]], they are sauteed with onions, or sometimes stewed with onions, coriander and red wine. In [[Russian cuisine]] these mushrooms are traditionally preserved by salting.

In [[India]], the fungus is one of the ten most widely consumed mushrooms by indigenous tribes of [[Meghalaya]].<ref name="Khaund 2014"/>

==Culture==
A fresco in the Roman town of [[Herculaneum]] appears to depict ''L.&nbsp;deliciosus'' and is one of the earliest pieces of art to illustrate a fungus.<ref name="Ramsbottom1953" /><ref>Loizides M., Kyriakou T., Tziakouris A.
