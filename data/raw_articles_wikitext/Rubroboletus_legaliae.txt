'''''Rubroboletus legaliae''''', previously known as ''Boletus splendidus'', ''B.&nbsp;satanoides'', and ''B.&nbsp;legaliae'' is a [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] of the family [[Boletaceae]]. It is [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]], with predominantly [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s, and is related to ''[[Rubroboletus satanas]]''.

It's uncommon in [[Southern England]], and [[Europe]], and grows with oak (''[[Quercus]]'') and beech (''[[Beech|Fagus]]'') often on neutral to acid soils.<ref name="C&D1995" /> It is considered [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] in the Czech Republic.<ref name="Mikšik 2012" /> In Britain, all of the boletes in the '''''Satanas''''' group are either very rare, endangered, or extinct.

== Taxonomy ==
''Boletus legaliae'' was [[species description|described]] by Czech [[mycologist]] [[Albert Pilát]] in 1968. It is named after the French mycologist [[Marcelle Le Gal]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Bernard Crozes |title=Les femmes mycologues |url=http://mycostra.free.fr/bulletin/femmes_mycologues.htm |access-date=2008-07-04 |publisher=Mycological Society of Strasbourg |language=French}}</ref>

''Boletus splendidus'' as described by Charles-Édouard Martín in 1894 is a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]]. The description of ''Boletus satanoides'' was too vague to be ascribed to any actual species. ''Boletus legaliae'' was transferred to the genus ''[[Rubroboletus]]'' in 2015 by Marco Della Maggiora and Renzo Trassinelli.<ref name="Maggiora 2015" />

== Description ==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially off-white, or coffee-coloured at the button stage. In mid life it often (but not always) turns a pale mouse grey. In old age the cap turns reddish, or what has been described as 'old rose'.<ref name="C&D1995">{{cite book | author = Régis Courtecuisse | author2 = Bernard Duhem | name-list-style=amp  | year = 1995 | title = Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and Europe | publisher = Harper Collins | isbn = 0-00-220025-2}}</ref> It may reach {{convert|14|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter.

The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is stocky, with a narrow red reticulation (net pattern) on an orange ground at the apex. This orange ground colour fades gradually towards the midsection, making the red reticulation more pronounced. At the base the reticulation is absent, and the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] turns dark [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]. Sometimes the stipe detail can be faint, or even absent when covered with earth or leaf litter. The pores are initially red, but have an overall orange colour when mature, and they bruise blue. The flesh turns pale blue on cutting / dark vinaceous in the stipe base. Often this blueing process is very slow, sometimes taking a minute or so for the flesh to turn a light blue. In other situations, blueing is near-instant. The flesh is said to smell of [[chicory]].<ref name="MarcelBon87">{{cite book | author = Marcel Bon | year = 1987 | title = The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North Western Europe | publisher = Hodder and Stoughton | isbn = 0-340-39935-X}}</ref>



==Occurrence in the UK==
R. legaliae is an uncommon to rare species in the UK, commonly occurring in open woodland or parkland with plenty of sun on neutral-to-acidic soil. Assessed as 'Vulnerable' by the JNCC, it has a population of around 560 mature specimens. An unusual morph with bright yellow pores has been recorded from Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, sometimes growing alongside normal-pored variants.<ref>A.M. Ainsworth, J.H. Smith, L. Boddy, B.T.M.

===Similar species===
''[[Rubroboletus satanas]]'', found in broad-leaved woodland on calcareous soil, has a whiter [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that turns brownish-ochre, lacking the overall reddish tones in maturity. It has a more nauseating smell.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref>
