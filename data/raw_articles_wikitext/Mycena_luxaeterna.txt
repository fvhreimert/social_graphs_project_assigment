'''''Mycena luxaeterna''''', commonly known as the '''eternal light mushroom''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Mycenaceae]]. The mushrooms have parachute-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] which start off darkly grayish-brown, changing to grayish-yellow or pale grayish-brown with a pale white ring at the edge when mature, and reach up to {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.  Their thin, cylindrical, hollow, fragile [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to  {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter are covered in a thick gel and emit a constant yellow-green [[bioluminescence]] (the caps do not glow). The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached.  The mushroom has a slightly radish-like smell and similar slightly bitter taste.<ref name=R1>{{Cite journal | last=Desjardin | first=Dennis E. |author2=Brian A. Perry |author3=D.

==Habitat==
The mushroom was discovered in a very limited area of the Atlantic rain forest of [[São Paulo]], Brazil and is known to exist only at this location. It grows on decomposing twigs, rarely on dead leaves or undergrowth, and in clusters of two-to-twenty individuals.  Dennis Desjardin is credited with the discovery.<ref name=R1/>

==Uses==
The eternal light mushroom has no known nutritional value, contains no known [[hallucinogens]], and is not reported as having any particular cultural significance. Its extreme rarity means that it has never been common in cooking.
