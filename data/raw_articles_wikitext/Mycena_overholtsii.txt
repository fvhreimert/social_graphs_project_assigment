'''''Mycena overholtsii''''', commonly known as the '''snowbank fairy helmet''' or '''fuzzy foot''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Mycenaceae]]. The mushrooms produced by the fungus are relatively large for the genus ''[[Mycena]]'', with convex grayish [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter and [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|15|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} long. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are whitish to pale gray, and initially closely spaced before becoming well-spaced at maturity after the cap enlarges. The mushrooms are characterized by the dense covering of white "hairs" on the base of the stem. ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii'' is an example of a [[snowbank fungus]], growing on well-decayed [[conifer]] logs near snowbanks, during or just after [[snowmelt]]. Formerly known only from high-elevation areas of western North America, particularly the [[Rocky Mountain]] and [[Cascade Range|Cascade]] regions, it was reported for the first time in Japan in 2010. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown. ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii'' can be distinguished from other comparable species by differences in location, or [[Basidiospore|spore]] size.

==History and naming==
The species was first described by mycologists [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[Wilhelm Solheim (botanist)|Wilhelm Solheim]] in 1953, on the basis of specimens collected in the [[Medicine Bow Mountains]] of [[Albany County, Wyoming]].<ref name=Smith1953/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] honors the early 20th-century American mycologist [[Lee Oras Overholts]].<ref name=Evenson1997/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "snowbank fairy helmet",<ref name=McKnight1987/> or "fuzzy foot",<ref name=Cripps2009/> although it shares the latter name with ''[[Tapinella atrotomentosa]]''<ref name=Russell2006/> and ''[[Xeromphalina campanella]]''.<ref name=Bessette2007/> ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii'' has been given the Japanese name ''yukitsutsumikunugitake''.<ref name=Cha2010/>

''Mycena overholtsii'' produces some of the largest mushrooms of the genus ''[[Mycena]]''.<ref name="urlUSDeptInterior"/> They have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are {{convert|1.5|to|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter, and convex in shape, developing an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] (a central protrusion resembling a nipple) in maturity. The cap surface is smooth, moist, and marked with radial striations.<ref name=Miller2006/> The caps are somewhat [[hygrophanous]], and depending on age and state of hydration, range in color from brown or grayish-brown,<ref name=Orr1979/> to dark or bluish-gray. The mushroom [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and watery, with a light gray color.<ref name=Evenson1997/>

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an [[adnation|adnate]], [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]], or shallowly [[decurrent]] attachment to the stem, and are initially closely spaced before becoming well-spaced at maturity.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena overholtzii"/> They have a whitish to pale gray color, and will stain gray when they are bruised.<ref name=Phillips2005/> There are three or four tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem) interspersed between the gills.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena overholtzii"/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4|to|15|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} long by {{convert|0.3|to|1|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick, and tapers upward so that the stem apex is slightly thinner than the base.<ref name=Miller2006/> It can be straight or curved, has cartilage-like flesh, and is hollow in maturity.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena overholtzii"/> When growing on soft, well-decayed wood, the stem often penetrates deeply into the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]].<ref name=McKnight1987/> The stem is pinkish-brown in color, and the lower half is tomentose – densely covered with white, woolly hairs.<ref name=Orr1979/> The mushroom has a yeast-like odor and a mild taste;<ref name=PNRS1999/> its [[edible mushroom|edibility]] is unknown,<ref name=Orr1979/> but it is not considered [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].<ref name=Miller2006/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
Viewed in deposit, as with a [[spore print]], the [[Basidiospore|spores]] appear white. Microscopically, the spores are roughly elliptical, sometimes appearing bean-shaped, with dimensions of 5.5–7 by 3–3.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. They are thin-walled and smooth, and bear an indistinct [[hilum (biology)|hilar appendage]].<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Mycena overholtzii"/> The spores are [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning they will absorb [[iodine]] and turn black to blue-black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge), which are scattered and interspersed with basidia, are roughly cylindric to fusoid (spindle-shaped), smooth, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and  measure 45–65 by 2–5.5&nbsp;μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are uncommon, and similar in appearance to the cheilocystidia. The [[Pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is an ixocutis (a fungal tissue type in which the [[hypha]]e are gelatinous and lie flat) with mostly smooth hyphae that are 1.5–3.5&nbsp;μm in diameter. The cap flesh is dextrinoid, meaning it will turn reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii''.<ref name=PNRS1999/>

Other similar mycenas that grow in clusters on wood include ''[[Mycena maculata|M.&nbsp;maculata]]'' and ''[[Mycena galericulata|M.&nbsp;galericulata]]''. The fruit bodies of ''M.&nbsp;maculata'' often develop red stains as they mature, but this characteristic is inconsistent and cannot be reliably used for identification. Its spores are larger than that of ''M.&nbsp;overholtsii'', measuring 7–10 by 4–6&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Trudell2009/> ''M.&nbsp;galericulata'' is very similar in appearance to ''M.&nbsp;maculata'', but does not undergo reddish staining; its spores are 8–12 by 5.5–9&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Trudell2009" /> Another similar species is ''[[Mycena semivestipes|M.&nbsp;semivestipes]]'',<ref name=Geesteranus1992/> which can be distinguished by its [[bleach]]-like odor, an eastern North American distribution, fruiting season during summer and autumn, and small spores measuring 4–5 by 2.5–3&nbsp;μm.<ref name="urlKuo:Mycena semivestipes"/>

==Habitat and distribution==

This species is sometimes found singly, but more often in clusters on well-rotted [[conifer]] logs and stumps (often [[Douglas-fir]]) near melting snowbanks,<ref name=McKnight1987/> or sometimes in moist snow chambers formed by receding snow.<ref name=Phillips2005/> Cool nighttime temperatures reduce the snowmelt rate, and help ensure that spores released by the mushroom will be dispersed into the soil.<ref name=Miller2006/> The mushroom is common in western North America, particularly the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Cascade Range|Cascade mountains]]. It has been reported in four US states: [[South Dakota]],<ref name=Gabel2007/> [[California]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], but is not known in [[Oregon]].<ref name=PNRS1999/> It is also found in western Canada.<ref name=Farr1989/> The mushroom is restricted to areas with minimum elevations of {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name="urlUSDeptInterior"/> In 2010, it was reported growing in the [[boreal forest|boreal]] coniferous forests of [[Hokkaido]], Japan, in plantations of [[Sakhalin fir]] (''Abies sachalinensis''), as well as in natural forests dominated by both Sakhalin fir and [[Jezo spruce]] (''Picea jezoensis'').<ref name=Cha2010/> In North America, the mushroom usually appears between March and July;<ref name=PNRS1999/> Japanese collections were made in May.<ref name=Cha2010/> The fruiting period can be prolonged, especially in areas with heavy snowfall,<ref name=Smith1980/> or at high elevations where the snowmelt is delayed.<ref name=Miller2006/>
