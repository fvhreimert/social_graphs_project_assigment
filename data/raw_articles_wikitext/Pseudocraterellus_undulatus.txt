[[Hymenium]] is wrinkled and branching, greyish-brown in colour with distant spacing and decurrent attachment. '''Stem:''' 3–6&nbsp;cm. Tapers downwards and is often grooved and twisted with adjacent mushrooms fusing together above the base. '''Spore print:''' White to pale yellow.

== Habitat and distribution ==
Grows on soil and amongst leaf litter in broad-leaved woods. It is a [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizal]] species which is especially associated with beech, hazel and oak trees. Can grow as a solitary mushroom or in small groups which may be attached to one another. It is widespread but only occasionally found and may grow from Summer to Autumn.

== Edibility ==
Whilst ''P. undulatus'' is regarded as an edible mushroom with a mild taste; it may grow too rarely to justify picking.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pseudocraterellus undulatus (Craterellus sinuosus), Sinuous Chanterelle |url=https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/pseudocraterellus-undulatus.php |access-date=2022-07-07 |website=www.first-nature.com}}</ref>
