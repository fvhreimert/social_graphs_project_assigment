'''''Psilocybe caerulescens''''', also known as '''landslide mushroom'''  ("derrumbe" in Spanish), is a  [[psilocybin mushroom]] having [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as main active compounds. Along with ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe aztecorum]]'', it is one of the mushrooms likely to have been used by the [[Aztec]]s and is currently used by [[Mazatec]] shamans for its [[entheogen]]ic properties.

== Description ==
The taste and smell of ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' are strongly [[farinaceous]], reminiscent of cucumber, though the smell lessens with age or when dry.



== Cap ==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is (1)3–7(10) cm broad. [[Wikt:convex|Convex]] to obtusely [[wikt:campanulate|campanulate]] with an incurved margin at first, rarely becoming plane, and often are [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]] or with a slight depression in the center. It is [[wikt:viscid|viscid]] when moist from a separable gelatinous [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]]. The margin is slightly translucent-striate when moist. The cap is [[hygrophanous]], yellowish brown to reddish brown with a silvery-blue metallic luster, paler at the margin, and drying to a beige or straw yellow. It readily bruises blue when handled, the younger specimens bruising bluish olivaceous or even blackish. The cap often has a great variation in color and form.

== Gills ==
The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[adnation|adnate]] to [[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]] and close to subclose. They are whitish, yellowish grey when young, becoming dark [[wikt:violaceous|violaceous]] brown to sepia brown with age; the edges remain slightly whitish.<br>
''Psilocybe caerulescens'' [[spore]]s are dark violaceous brown.

== Stipe ==
The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is (2)5–9(13) cm long and (5)8–10(12) mm thick. It is equal or enlarging slightly at the base, and is somewhat flexuous, hollow, and [[wikt:subpruinose|subpruinose]] to [[wikt:floccose|floccose]]. The stipe is whitish to reddish brown or blackish and readily bruises blue. [[mycelial cord|Rhizomorphs]] are sometimes attached to the base. The [[veil (botany)|veil]] is well-developed but does not form a permanent [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]].

=== Microscopic features ===
The [[spore]]s are [[wikt:hexaganal|hexagonal]] to [[wikt:subrhomboid|subrhomboid]] in frontal view and [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] in side view, (5.6)6.7–8(9) x (4) 4.8–6.4 (7.2) x 4–4.8 (5.5) μm. The [[basidium|basidia]] each produce four spores, and occasionally only two larger spores. The [[cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]] are 16–27(29) x 4.5–8 μm and lageniform to narrowly lageniform, with a flexuous neck that is 1–2.5 [[μm]] broad and sometimes bifurcate. Basidia 18.5–22.5 × 5.5–6.5 [[μm]], cylindrical, four spored, hyaline and thin-walled. Pleurocystidia 12–20 (–32) × 4.5–9 (‒10) [[μm]], fusiform, occasionally conical, clavate or utriform, occasionally bifurcate, hyaline, thin-walled. The subhymenium is ramose-inflated. Pileus trama is radial, with hyphae 5–32 [[μm]], yellowish to yellowish brown, thick walled (0.5–1 [[μm]]). Pileipellis an ixocutis, (9–) 12–54 [[μm]] wide, hyphae 1.5–4 (–5.5) [[μm]] diameter, hyaline and thin-walled. Pileocystidia (10–) 12–28 × 4–9.5 [[μm]], globose, cylindrical, clavate, flexuose or pyriform and thin-walled. Stipitipellis a cutis, hyphae 1.5–9.5 [[μm]] diameter, yellowish brown, thin-walled (up to 0.5–0.8 [[μm]] thick). Caulocystidia (19–) 22.5–49.5 (–56) × 4–8 (–9.5) [[μm]], cylindrical, lageniform, fusiform or, utriform, or lageniform, hyaline and, thin-walled.

== Habitat and formation ==
''Psilocybe caerulescens'' is found growing [[wikt:gregarious|gregariously]] or [[wikt:cespitose|cespitosely]], rarely solitarily, from June through October on [[disturbed ground]] often devoid of herbaceous plants. It often grows in sunny locations, preferring muddy orangish brown soils with much woody debris. ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' was first reported from near [[Montgomery, Alabama]], by Murrill in 1923 on sugarcane mulch, not re-documented from that locality since. It was recently found in [[South Carolina]] in September 2008. ''Psilocybe caerulescens'' is common and widespread throughout northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Found in N. Georgia in 2000.
