The edibility of this mushroom is controversial; some sources claim that it is [[edible mushroom|edible]], while others claim it to be [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]], although effects are little known and its toxic constituents undescribed.

==Taxonomy==
The French mycologist [[Lucien Quélet]] gave the species its current [[binomial name]] in 1872, after it was initially described as ''Agaricus aeruginosus'' by William Curtis in 1784. The Dutch mycologist [[Machiel Noordeloos]] placed it in the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]'' in 1995. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''aerūgǐnōsa'' is [[Latin]] for "covered in [[verdigris]]".<ref name=Haas69>{{cite book | last = Haas |first=Hans | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi |page= 215| publisher = Burke | isbn= 0-222-79409-7|quote=L.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is convex, broadening, and becoming [[umbonate]] with age. It is {{Convert|2–8|cm|frac=4}} wide. At first it is a vivid blue/green, and very glutinous (slimy), with a sprinkling of white [[Universal veil|veil]] remnants<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=209-210}}</ref> around the edge. The colour in the gluten fades, or is washed off as it matures, and it becomes yellow ocher,<ref name=":0" /> sometimes in patches, but mostly at the centre. Finally, it will lose the blue-green coloration completely. The white [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]<ref name=":0" /> is quite long and of uniform thickness. It has a fragile brown/black [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], and below this the stem is covered in fine white scales, or flakes. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially white, then clay-brown, and sometimes have a white edge. The [[spore print]] is brownish-purple, and the oval [[basidiospore|spores]] 7–10 x 5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan |page= 248| isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==


This mushroom is common in grassy woods, and on roadside verges in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]], Asia (Iran)<ref name=Asef2010>{{cite book |title=قارچهای سمی ایران (Qarch-ha-ye Sammi-ye Iran) |trans-title=Poisonous mushrooms of Iran |year=2010 |author=Asef Shayan, M.R. |publisher=Iran shenasi |page=214 |isbn=978-964-2725-29-8 |language=Persian}}</ref> and parts of [[North America]], growing on rotting wood. It particularly favours wood-chip mulches in gardens, and parks.

==Edibility and toxicity==
The verdigris agaric is reported as [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] in many guidebooks printed in the Western Hemisphere,<ref name=Arora1986/><ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil |url-access=registration |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil/page/228 228]}}</ref> but the effect of poisoning and toxic constituents are unclear.<ref>{{cite book | last = North| first = Pamela | year = 1967 | title = Poisonous Plants and Fungi in colour | publisher = Blandford Press & Pharmacological Society of Great Britain |pages= 111–12}}</ref>

According to some European guidebooks the verdigris agaric is edible, but undesirable to some due to a mildly spicy taste.<ref>[http://www.toadstool.ru/spisok-rodov/stropharia/stropharia-aeruginosa/ STROPHARIA AERUGINOSA, СТРОФАРИЯ СИНЕ-ЗЕЛЕНАЯ]</ref>
