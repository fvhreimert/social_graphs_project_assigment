==Taxonomy==
Two recent molecular studies show that ''A.&nbsp;farinosa'' is part of a subgroup within ''[[Amanita]]'' with its close relatives ''[[Amanita muscaria|A.&nbsp;muscaria]]'', ''[[Amanita gemmata|A.&nbsp;gemmata]]'' and ''[[Amanita roseotincta|A.&nbsp;roseotincta]]''.<ref>Moncalvo J-M, Drehmel D, & Vilgalys R.

==Description==
The cap is {{Convert|2.5–7|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} in diameter, domed in young and flat in older specimens, with a striate margin. It is whitish grey and covered with brownish grey volval or mealy material. The [[gill (mushroom)|gill]]s are white. They may be attached to the stem or free. They are close and crowded and not bruising. The stem, or the stipe, lacks a ring and at its base a smallish bulb or [[Volva (mycology)|volva]]. It measures up to 6.5&nbsp;cm high, 1&ndash;3&nbsp;cm thick. The stem is white to tan in color.<ref name=Mushroomexpert>Kuo, M. (2008, March). Amanita farinosa. Retrieved from the MushroomExpert.Com Web site: http://www.mushroomexpert.com/amanita_farinosa.html</ref> The spores are white. They are 5.5&ndash;8 x 6&ndash;8&nbsp;[[μm]] in measurement and inamyloid. The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are smooth and round to broadly elliptical. The flesh is white in color. It does not stain on exposure.<ref name="Mushroomexpert"/> In old specimens, the smell can be strong and that of [[mink]].

The [[poisonous mushroom]] resembles some other members of its genus.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=528}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
An uncommon mushroom, it is found in eastern North America from summer to autumn underwood [[hardwood]] trees.<ref name="audu" />
