'''''Tricholoma vernaticum''''' is an [[agaric]] fungus of the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]''. It was originally described in 1976 as a species of ''[[Armillaria]]'' when that genus was more inclusive; it received its current name twenty years later. The stout [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) have moist white to grayish [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] (later becoming grayish-brown with age), a membranous [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and an odor resembling cucumbers.

The species is native to the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States. [[Mycorrhiza]]l with [[conifer]]s, it fruits in the spring or early summer, appearing on the ground singly or in groups at high elevations, often at the edge of melting snowbanks. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown, but it has an unpleasant odor and a [[wikt:mealy|mealy]] taste.

==Taxonomy==

The species was originally [[species description|described]] from [[California]] as ''Armillaria olida'' by mycologists [[Harry D. Thiers]] and [[Walter Sundberg]] in 1976. The [[type (biology)|type]] specimen was collected on May 6, 1972, in the Crystal Basin Recreation Area in [[El Dorado County]]. Thiers and Sundberg [[classification (biology)|classified]] it in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Ponderosa'' of genus ''Armillaria'' due to its [[inamyloid]] spores, but noted that its relationship to other species was unclear. They also noted the similarity of the form and color of its cap to species in section ''Constricta'' of genus ''[[Lyophyllum]]''.<ref name="Thiers 1976"/>

Thiers and Sundberg used a broad [[species concept]] of ''Armillaria'', including species with a white [[spore print]], [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] attached to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] formed from a [[partial veil]], regardless of their ecological preferences. Today, ''Armillaria'' is restricted to [[wood-rotting fungi]] that form black [[rhizomorph]]s, and several [[mycorrhiza]]l former ''Armillaria'' have since been transferred to ''[[Tricholoma]]''. The name ''[[Tricholoma olida]]'' was unavailable for this species, because it was previously used in 1920 by [[Josef Velenovský]],<ref name="Velenovský 1920"/> so Kris Shanks proposed the new name ''T.&nbsp;vernaticum''. The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] refers to its growth in the spring.<ref name="Shanks 1996"/> The previous epithet ''olida'' derives from the [[Latin]] ''olidum'', meaning "stinking" or "smelling".<ref name="Gledhill 2008"/>

''Tricholoma vernaticum'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[subgenus]] ''Contextocutis'' of the genus ''Tricholoma'' on account of its [[clamp connection]]s and interwoven [[hypha]]e in the [[cap cuticle]].<ref name="Shanks 1996"/>

==Description==


The cap is convex to broadly convex before flattening out in age, and reaches diameters between {{convert|6 and 15|cm|abbr=on|round=0.5}} wide. The surface is smooth, dry to moist, and in maturity may have white patches of [[Veil (mycology)|veil]] remnant.<ref name="Arora1986" /> As the mushroom ages, the cap color changes from white to fuscous (dusky brownish grey) or brown, usually with olive, grayish or pale tan regions. The cap margin, initially curved downward, lifts up and becomes lobed or irregular with age. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick and white, with a strongly [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] odor similar to cucumber or watermelon rind.<ref name="Arora1986" /> The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] initially have an emarginate (notched) to [[adnation|adnate]] attachment to the stipe, but pull away as the mushroom matures to become seceding or almost free from attachment. They are thick, closely spaced, and whitish in color,<ref name="Arora1986" /> sometimes developing pale pink tints.

The solid stipe measures {{convert|4–14|cm|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1.3–4|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick, and is either equal in width through its length or bulged at the base.<ref name="Davis 2012" /> The dry surface has a texture that is smooth to silky fibrillose above the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and appressed fibrillose to scaly below. The ring, located in the middle to upper half of the stem, is sometimes inconspicuous. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown with certainty,<ref name="Bessette 2013" /> but it has been noted to have a strongly farinaceous taste, and an unpleasant odor "strongly reminiscent of rotting white potatoes".<ref name="Thiers 1976" />



The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name=Arora1986/> The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are elliptic (or narrowly so), and measure 8–12 by 4.8–6.2&nbsp;[[μm]]. There are [[clamp connection]]s present in the [[hypha]]e.<ref name="Bessette 2013"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 23–30 by 8–10&nbsp;μm. The [[hymenium]] lacks [[cystidia]]. The cap flesh comprises homogenous, interwoven hyphae that are 3–5&nbsp;μm in diameter, while the [[cap cuticle]] is a layer between 200 and 300 μm thick comprising interwoven, gelatinous hyphae up to 4&nbsp;μm in diameter.<ref name="Thiers 1976"/>

When collected in its typical habitat and during the appropriate season, the mushrooms can be readily identified because of their prominent characteristics: white color, stocky fruit body, farinaceous odor, and ring on the stipe. ''Tricholoma'' lookalikes in the same geographic region grow at lower elevations, typically in autumn. ''[[Tricholoma portentosum|T.&nbsp;portentosum]]'' has a gray cap,- <ref name=Arora1986>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/193/mode/2up |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=193}}</ref> a stipe with yellow tints, and lacks a ring, while ''[[Tricholoma mutabile|T.&nbsp;mutabile]]'' has violet tones in its cap and also lacks a ring. Other lookalikes include ''[[Hygrophorus subalpinus]]'' and ''[[Hygrophorus camarophyllus|H.&nbsp;camarophyllus]]'', but these species have broad, waxy gills, and lack the characteristic odor of ''T.&nbsp;vernaticum''.<ref name="Bessette 2013"/>

==Habitat and distribution==

The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups under [[conifer]]s in late spring and early summer. A fairly common species throughout its range, it is found at high elevations in California north to [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].<ref name="Bessette 2013"/> It is a [[snowbank fungus]], meaning it is commonly found at the edge of melting snowbanks.<ref name="Davis 2012"/> Fruit bodies are often buried under [[humus]],<ref name="Thiers 1976"/> forming hardly visible "mushrumps", apparent only as cracked bumps on the ground.<ref name="Bessette 2013"/>
