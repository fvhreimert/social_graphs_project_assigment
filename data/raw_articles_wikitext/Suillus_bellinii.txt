'''''Suillus bellinii''''', the '''Champagne bolete''', is a [[Boletales|pored mushroom]] of the genus ''[[Suillus]]'' in the family [[Suillaceae]]. It is found in coastal [[Pinus|pine]] forests of southern Europe.

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex and irregular, but becomes flatter with maturity, reaching up to 15&nbsp;cm in diameter. The thick [[Pileipellis|cuticle]] is brown and marbled with white to gray tones towards the periphery, especially in young specimens. It is very viscid during wet weather and peels easily - characteristics shared by many species of ''Suillus''. The [[Hymenium|tubes]] are short, while the pores are small and coloured whitish, beige and, with maturity, yellowish. The pores may exude a reddish latex in fresh specimens.

The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is short, cylindrical and coloured whitish, ornamented with reddish dots along its length. The firm [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish and yellowish in the stipe base and it is said to have a fruity odour and a pleasant taste. It is often infested with insect larvae. In a colour reaction test with [[ammonia]] solution, the flesh turns crimson.

The [[spore]]s are ochre-brown in colour, fusiform, sized 8-10 by 3.5-4.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name=Fungibalear>{{cite web |url=http://www.fungibalear.net/espanol/mostra_bolet_e.php?codi=71 |title=''Suillus bellinii'' at Fungibalear.net | publisher = Secció Micològica Museu Balear de Ciències Naturals |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref><ref name=Gerault>{{Cite journal | last = Gerault | first = Alain | title = ''Florule Evolutive des ''Basidiomycotina'' du Finistere – Homobasidiomycetes''| language = French | version = 2.0 | date = May 2005}}</ref>

==Habitat==
''Suillus bellinii'' is a thermophilic fungus, occurring in the [[Mediterranean]] region of [[southern Europe]] in coastal [[Pinus|pine]] forests. It forms [[Mycorrhiza#Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] associations with species of pine including [[Pinus halepensis|Aleppo pine]] (''Pinus halepensis''), [[Pinus pinaster|maritime pine]] (''Pinus pinaster'') and [[Pinus pinea|stone pine]] (''Pinus pinea'').<ref name=Gerault/><ref name=Bresadola>{{cite web |url=http://www.webalice.it/mondellix/Funghi%20S.htm#Suillus%20bellini |title=''Suillus bellinii'' at Associazone Micologica Bresadola Gruppo di Messina |language=Italian |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref>

==Edibility==
It is reportedly [[edible mushroom|edible]]. Removal of the slimy [[cap cuticle]] is recommended.<ref name=Fungibalear/><ref name=Bresadola/>

''Suillus bellinii'' often shares its habitat with ''[[Suillus mediterraneensis]]''. The flesh of the latter species is yellow.<ref name=Gerault/>
