It is a small, fragile, long stemmed, and variably coloured brittlegill, found in mixed forests and woods in Eurasia and North America.

==Taxonomy==
''Russula fragilis'' was first described as ''Agaricus fragilis'' by mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801, and later placed in the genus ''[[Russula]]'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{Convert|2–5|cm|frac=4}} in diameter.<ref name="Arora1986" /> It varies greatly in colour, and can be dark purplish, with a dark, almost black centre, or may be various shades of olive-green, or violet-pink, or even pale yellow. The colour tends to fade quickly, and can become very pale. At first the cap shape is convex, but it later flattens. The [[pileipellis|cap skin]] peels to three quarters, and older specimens often have a furrowed margin.

The fragile, white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is long for the size of the cap, and narrowly club-shaped. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed, and white giving a [[spore print]] of the same colour. They have distinctive nicks, or notches on their free edges, that can be seen under a hand lens, a very good diagnostic clue to species. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white and tastes very hot, with a fruity odour.<ref name="Phillips06">{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|pages = 25}}</ref>

=== Similar species ===
''[[Russula betularum]]'' is frequently found with [[birch]] and although usually paler, can be mistaken for washed-out specimens of ''R.&nbsp;fragilis''; [[Russula gracillima|''R.&nbsp;gracillima'']] is similar in appearance and grows in the same locations, although neither species have nicks (serrations) on the gill edges.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Russula fragilis'' appears in late summer and autumn, usually growing in small groups. It is widespread in the northern [[temperate]] zones of Europe, Asia, and North America. It is probably [[mycorrhiza]]l with a variety of trees, including [[birch]] and [[oak]].<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Laessoe T.| year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref> It often appears on or near rotted wood.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=52}}</ref>

==Toxicity==
This mushroom is inedible<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |orig-year=2005 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=134}}</ref> due the toxins it contains and its very hot taste.<ref name="Miller2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=84}}</ref> Many hot-tasting ''Russula'' species cause problems of a [[Gastrointestinal disease|gastrointestinal]] nature when consumed, resulting in [[diarrhoea]], and vomiting.
