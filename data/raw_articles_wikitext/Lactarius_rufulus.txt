'''''Lactarius rufulus''''', also known as the '''rufous candy cap''' or the '''southern candy cap''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Russulaceae]]. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have fleshy brownish-red [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, and closely spaced pinkish-yellow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick and colored similarly to the cap. The fruit bodies resembles those of ''[[Lactarius rufus|L.&nbsp;rufus]]'', but ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'' tends to grow in clusters at a common base, rather than solitarily or in groups. A distinguishing microscopic characteristic is the near absence of large, spherical cells called sphaerocysts that are otherwise common in ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'' species.

The species, known only from [[California]], [[Arizona]], and Mexico, grows on the ground in leaf litter near [[oak]] trees. ''Lactarius rufulus'' mushrooms are [[edible mushroom|edible]], and have an odor resembling [[maple syrup]]. They have been used to flavor confections and desserts.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1907, based on specimens collected at [[Stanford University]] in California.<ref name=Peck1907/> The type collections were made by A.M.&nbsp;Patterson and S.&nbsp;Nohara, botany students at the [[Leland Stanford Junior University]] who made a number of collections during the winter of 1906–07.<ref name=Kerrigan1979/>

''Lactarius rufulus'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Thejogali'' of the [[subgenus]] Russularia of the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]''. The surface characteristics of many species in section ''Thejogali'' (as defined by [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler|Hesler]] and [[Alexander H. Smith|Smith]] in 1979) are called rimulose-areolate (irregularly cracked, with the cracks crossing one another) based on a surface with "numerous mounds of inflated cells" paired together with crevices.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, p. 25.</ref>

The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "rufous candy cap".<ref name=Arora1986/>

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'' is {{convert|3|–|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, broadly convex, becoming flattened and eventually shallowly funnel-shaped, sometimes with a slight [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The cap margin (edge) is initially curved inwards but becomes curved upward in maturity. The surface is usually uneven or wrinkled.<ref name=Arora1986/> It is brownish red at first, but fades to orange-brown with age. The attachment of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] to the stem is [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] (squarely attached) to subdecurrent (running slightly down the length of the stem). They are packed close together, at first pinkish-yellow, but with age become a darker red or reddish brown. The gills are not forked, nor do they stain a different color when bruised. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4|–|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, about {{convert|0.5|–|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, nearly equal or slightly enlarged downward, dry, smooth, and reddish brown.<ref name="H&S pp. 512-13"/>{{#tag:ref|Arora gives a larger maximum range for both the stem length and width—{{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, respectively.<ref name=Arora1986/>|group=nb}} It may be solid or stuffed (filled with cotton-like [[mycelia]]), but may become partially hollow with age. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, white to pinkish-orange, and does not stain when cut. The [[latex]] is scant, white, unchanging, and does not stain tissues. Its taste is [[wikt:mild|mild]]. The [[spore print]] is white to creamy yellow.

===Microscopic characteristics===
The [[spore]]s are 7–9 by 7–9&nbsp;[[μm]], spherical or nearly so, ornamented with a partial to complete reticulum (a system of raised, net-like ridges), with prominences up to 0.5&nbsp;μm high. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are both two- and four-spored, and measure 45–52 by 9–11&nbsp;μm. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a poorly formed layer of inflated cells with scattered filamentous pileocystidia ([[cystidium|cystidia]] on the cap).<ref name=Bessette2009/> Somewhat unusual for a ''Lactarius'', ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'' lacks or has few swollen cells (sphaerocysts) in the cap and stem.<ref name=Arora1986/>

''[[Lactarius rubidus]]'' is similar in appearance to ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'', but it has watery to whey-like latex and develops a strong odor of maple syrup or [[butterscotch]] when dried. Another lookalike is ''Lactarius thiersii'', but it has a smaller cap and stem and has mild-tasting flesh and latex. The flesh and latex of ''[[Lactarius rufus]]'' have a strongly acrid taste, and its fruit bodies are stouter and lack an umbo.<ref name=Bessette2009/> Additionally, ''L.&nbsp;rufus'' typically grows in a caespitose manner—with the fruit bodies clustered at a common base,<ref name=Peck1907/> and has more pallid colors and a more intense odor than ''L.&nbsp;rufulus''.<ref name="urlCandy Cap - BAMS"/> ''[[Lactarius vinaceorufescens|L.&nbsp;vinaceorufescens]]'' has a yellowing latex.<ref name=Arora1986/>

==Ecology, habitat, and distribution==
''Lactarius rufulus'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species, and lives in a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] association with [[oak]] species. The fungus forms an ectomycorrhizae—characterized by an external sheath that surround the rootlets of the oak. The fungus receives soluble [[carbohydrate]]s that are byproducts of the plant's [[photosynthesis]], while affording the plant greater access to soil nutrients needed for growth.  The fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;rufulus'' grow scattered or in groups on the ground under oak, usually from January to March; their appearance is uncommon.<ref name=Bessette2009/> Once thought to be only in [[California]] (where they are most prevalent in the southern part of the state),<ref name=Arora1986/> they were reported from Mexico in 1998,<ref name=Montoya1998/> and from [[Arizona]] in 2006.<ref name=Bates2006/>

==Uses==
The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]],<ref name="Bessette2009" /> with a mild taste and a slight odor of [[maple syrup]].{{#tag:ref|For reasons unexplained, several authors, including Peck,<ref name=Peck1907/> and Hesler and Smith,<ref name="H&S pp. 512-13">Hesler and Smith, 1979, pp. 512–13.</ref> have omitted mentioning the odor of the fruit bodies.|group=nb}} American author [[David Arora]] suggests that the fruit bodies may be used in a manner similar to the [[candy cap]] mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant.<ref name="Arora1991" /> Chefs in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] have been known to use it for desserts such as ice creams, cakes and caramels.<ref name="urlThrees a Trend: Mushroom Desserts - San Francisco Restaurants and Dining - SFoodie" />
