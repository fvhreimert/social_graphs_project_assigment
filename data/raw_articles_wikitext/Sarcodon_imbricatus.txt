'''''Sarcodon imbricatus''''', commonly known as the '''shingled hedgehog''' or '''scaly hedgehog''', is a species of [[tooth fungus]] in the order [[Thelephorales]]. The mushroom has a large, brownish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with large brown scales and may reach 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) in diameter. On the underside it sports greyish, brittle teeth instead of [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], and has white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]]. Its [[spore print]] is brown.

It ranges throughout Europe and North America, while collections from the British Isles are now assigned to ''[[Sarcodon squamosus]]''. It appears in autumn and is associated with spruce (''[[Picea]]''). The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but it may be bitter and possibly causes gastrointestinal upset. 

==Taxonomy==
The Swedish botanist [[Olof Celsius]] reported in 1732 that ''Sarcodon imbricatus'' occurred in the vicinity of [[Uppsala]], and [[Carl Linnaeus]] wrote of it in his 1737 work ''Flora lapponica''.<ref name=Nilper>{{cite book |last1=Nilson |first1=Sven  |last2=Persson |first2=Olle | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill-Fungi) | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063005-8|page=76}}</ref> It was one of the species initially described by Linnaeus, as ''Hydnum imbricatum'', in the second volume of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753.<ref>{{cite book | last=Linnaeus | first=C | authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Species Plantarum: Tomus II | publisher=Holmiae.

For many years, ''S.&nbsp;imbricatus'' was described associated with both spruce and pine, although the latter forms were smaller and noted to be more palatable by mushroom hunters in Norway. Furthermore, the mushroom has been used as a source of pigment and collectors noted that fresh specimens collected under pine yielded [[biological pigment|pigment]], but only old ones collected under spruce. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular analysis]] of the DNA revealed the two forms to be distinct genetically, and thus populations of what had been described as ''S.&nbsp;imbricatus'' were now assigned to ''[[Sarcodon squamosus|S.&nbsp;squamosus]]'', which includes collections in the British Isles and the Netherlands.<ref name=Joh99>{{cite journal |author1=Johanneson H |author2=Ryman S |author3=Lundmark H |author4=Danell E. |year=1999|title=''Sarcodon imbricatus'' and ''S. squamosus'' – two confused species |journal=Mycological Research |volume=103 |issue=11 |pages=1447–52 |doi=10.1017/S0953756299008709}}</ref>

==Uses==
===Culinary===
'' (scaly hedgehog tea)]]
'']]
Some sources (in the United States) report that the fungus is [[edible mushroom|edible]] but of poor quality;<ref name="arora86" /><ref name=":1" /> some others consider it edible and delicious.<ref name="Wells 1970" /> It may cause [[gastrointestinal upset]].<ref name=":0" /> The mushrooms can be bitter, especially older specimens. This can be mitigated by submerging them in boiling water.<ref name="Haas69" /> Some suspect that bitter specimens may actually be related species.<ref name="Wells 1970" />

The mushroom can be pickled or dried and used as flavouring.<ref name=Zeitl76/> In [[Bulgaria]], it is collected, dried and finely ground to be used as an aromatic mushroom [[flour]].<ref>{{cite book | author = Z. Angelova | title = Гъбите в България | publisher = Картография ЕООД (Bulgaria) }}</ref>

In [[Korean cuisine|Korea]], [[mushroom tea]] is made from it.

The distinctive spicy aroma of fried younger specimens has made it an expensive delicacy in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=February 2025}}
