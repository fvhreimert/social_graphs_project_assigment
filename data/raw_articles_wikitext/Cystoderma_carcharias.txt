'''''Cystoderma carcharias''''', is a [[species]] of [[agaric]] in the [[fungus|fungal]] [[family (biology)|family]] [[Agaricaceae]]. It has a widespread distribution, and has been collected in [[coniferous forest]]s and grasslands in Asia, Europe, North America, and the subantarctic islands. In the field, fruit bodies are characterized by a pink [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad, a well-developed [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and an unpleasant odour.

== Taxonomy ==

The species was first described scientifically by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]], who named it ''Agaricus carcharias'' in 1794.<ref name=Persoon1794>{{cite journal |title=Dispositio methodica fungorum |author=Persoon CH. |journal=Neues Magazin für die Botanik, Römer |volume=1 |year=1794 |pages=81–128 |language=la}}</ref> Swiss mycologist [[Victor Fayod]] assigned it its current name in 1889.<ref name=Fayod1889>{{cite journal |author=Fayod MV. |year=1889 |title=Prodrome d'une histoire naturelle des Agaricinés |journal=Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Botanique |volume=9 |series=VII |page=351 |language=fr}}</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''carcharias'' is probably derived from the [[Greek (language)|Greek]] καρχαρός (''karcharos'') which means sharp, pointed or jagged. καρχαρίας (''karcharias'') is translated as [[shark]].

== Description ==

The [[Basidiocarp|fruiting body]] of ''Cystoderma carcharias'' is a relatively small [[agaric]]. The fruiting body is characterised by an off-white and pale pink-tinged [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] with a distinct darker central spot, and a powdery cuticle. The cap is at first convex, but with maturity becomes flat and slightly [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]]. The cap is up to {{convert|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and may bear a margin fringed with remnants of a [[partial veil]]. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white, adnate and crowded. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is white and smooth above, and granular below a white, upturned, flared and persistent [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is cylindrical and up to {{convert|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, firm and full throughout.<ref name=Jordan>{{cite book |author=Jordan M. |title=The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe |publisher=David & Charles |location=London |year=1995 |page=214 |isbn=0-7153-0129-2}}</ref><ref name="Gerault">{{Cite journal | last = Gerault | first = Alain | title = ''Florule Evolutive des ''Basidiomycotina'' du Finistere – Heterobasidiomycetes – Tricholomatales (in French)''| version = 2.1 | date = October 2005| url = http://projet.aulnaies.free.fr/Florules/TRICHOLOMATALES.pdf}}</ref> Additionally, ''C.&nbsp;carcharias'' forma ''album'' is a form recognised as having a snow-white cap.<ref>{{cite web | title=Trial field key to the species of ''Cystoderma'' in the Pacific Northwest | publisher=Pacific Northwest Key Council | url=http://www.svims.ca/council/Cystod.htm | access-date=January 30, 2010 }}</ref>

The fruiting body of ''C. carcharias'' bears a characteristic strong, unpleasant odour. The odour has been described as earthy, muddy and mouldy by various authors. This has been attributed to the presence of the compound [[geosmin]].<ref name="advances">{{cite book|author=Tkacz J.

''Cystoderma carcharias'' is a fairly common fungus distributed in Europe, North America and [[temperate]] Asia,<ref name=Saar2003/> typically occurring in [[coniferous forest]]s.<ref name=Dennis1980>{{cite journal |author=Dennis RWG. |year=1980 |title=Micro fungi of St. Kilda |journal=Kew Bulletin |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=742–44 |doi=10.2307/4119067|jstor=4119067 }}</ref> It has also been found on the treeless, Australian subantarctic [[Macquarie Island]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Interactive Catalogue of Australian Fungi: ''Cystoderma carcharias'' | publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne | url=http://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/dbpages/cat/index.php/fungicatalogue/name/831 | access-date=February 7, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330074624/http://www.rbg.vic.gov.au/dbpages/cat/index.php/fungicatalogue/name/831 | archive-date=March 30, 2012 }}</ref> Fruit bodies are found singly or in groups on soil among grass or moss during late summer and autumn. The fungus is an [[Acidophile (organisms)|acidophilic]] litter [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotroph]] growing frequently under conifers, namely spruce.

''Cystoderma carcharias'' accumulates cadmium in its fruiting bodies.
