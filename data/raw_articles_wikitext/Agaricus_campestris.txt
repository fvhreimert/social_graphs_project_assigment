'''''Agaricus campestris''''' is a widely eaten [[Agaricales|gilled mushroom]] closely related to the cultivated ''[[Agaricus bisporus|A.&nbsp;bisporus]]'' (button mushroom). ''A.&nbsp;campestris'' is [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''field mushroom''' or, in North America, '''meadow mushroom'''.

It is considered a choice [[Edible mushroom|edible]] but resembles some [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species.

== Taxonomy ==
This species was originally noted and named in 1753 by [[Carl Linnaeus]] as ''Agaricus campestris''.<ref name="Linnaeus 1753" /> It was placed in the genus ''[[Psalliota]]'' by [[Lucien Quelet]] in 1872. Some variants have been isolated over the years, a few of which now have species status, for example, ''[[Agaricus bernardii]]'' Quel. (1878), ''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'' (J.E. Lange) Imbach (1946), ''[[Agaricus bitorquis]]'' (Quel.) Sacc. (1887), ''[[Agaricus cappellianus]]'' Hlavacek (1987), and ''[[Agaricus silvicola]]'' (Vittad.) Peck (1872). Some were so similar they did not warrant even [[variety (botany)|varietal]] status, while others have retained it. ''Agaricus campestris'' var. ''equestris''  (F.H.Moller) Pilat (1951) is still valid. ''A.&nbsp;campestris'' var. ''isabellinus'' (F.H.Moller) Pilat (1951), and ''A.&nbsp;campestris'' var. ''radicatus'', are possibly still valid too.

The [[Latin]] [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''campestris'' means "of the fields". [[Common name]]s given to the fungus include "meadow mushroom", "pink bottom",<ref name="Roody 2003" /> and "field mushroom".

An analysis of ribosomal DNA of a limited number of members of the genus showed ''A.&nbsp;campestris'' to be an early offshoot in the genus and sister taxon to ''[[Agaricus cupreobrunneus|A.&nbsp;cupreobrunneus]]''.<ref name="Geml2004">{{cite journal |vauthors=Geml J, Geiser DM, Royse DJ |year=2004 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Agaricus'' species based on ITS and LSU rDNA sequences |journal=Mycological Progress |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=157–76 |doi=10.1007/s11557-006-0086-8 |bibcode=2004MycPr...3..157G |s2cid=40265528}}</ref>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is white, may have fine scales, and is {{convert|3 to 12|cm|abbr=off|frac=4}} in diameter;<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially pink, then red-brown and finally a dark brown, as is the [[spore print]].

The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] bruises a dingy reddish brown, as opposed to yellow in the poisonous ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus]]'' and similar species. The thick-walled, dark brown, elliptical [[Basidiospore|spores]]<ref name=":0" /> measure 5.5–8&nbsp;[[μm]] by 4–5&nbsp;μm. [[Cheilocystidia]] are absent.<ref name="Milleriqbal 2006" />

===Similar species===
Several species may be confused with ''A.&nbsp;campestris''. The most dangerous confusion may be with the deadly ''[[Amanita virosa]]'' (one of the group colloquially called "destroying angel"),<ref name=Oregon/> or with the deadly ''[[Amanita hygroscopica]]'' (the pink-gilled destroying angel).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amanitaceae.org/?Amanita+hygroscopica|title=Amanita hygroscopica - Amanitaceae.org - Taxonomy and Morphology of Amanita and Limacella|website=www.amanitaceae.org}}</ref> ''Amanita'' species may be distinguished from ''Agaricus'' by a volva at the base, remnants of a universal veil. Such a veil may also be seen surrounding adjacent smaller button mushrooms, if present. It's recommended to look for smaller sibling buttons nearby, and slice one of them lengthwise to examine their anatomy. They may also be distinguished by a white or off-white spore print while mushrooms in the family ''Agaricacea'' are dark brown. In the US, ''A. camp.'' may also be confused with the poisonous ''[[Agaricus californicus]]''<ref name=":0" /> or ''[[Agaricus hondensis|A.&nbsp;hondensis]]''. White ''[[Clitocybe]]'' species that also grow in grassy places may be toxic. According to Moldenke, some authorities believed that the mandrakes referenced in Genesis and in Song of Solomon were not Mandragora Officinarum L, but instead might be Agaricus campestris L.<ref>Moldenke, Harold N., and Alma L. Moldenke. “132. Mandragora Officinarum L.” Essay. In Plants of the Bible, 137–39, 283. New York, NY: Kegan Paul, 2002. </ref>

A less serious, but more common, confusion is with ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus]]''<ref name="Oregon" /> (the yellow stainer), which causes gastrointestinal problems in many people. ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A.&nbsp;arvensis]]'' (the horse mushroom) is very similar and is an excellent edible.

It is nearly identical (except microscopically) to the edible species ''[[Agaricus andrewii]]'' and ''[[Agaricus solidipes|A.&nbsp;solidipes]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |publisher=Firefly Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |location=Buffalo, NY |page=219}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Murrill |first1=William |author-link1=William Murrill |date=1922 |title=Dark-Spored Agarics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4IpNAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA203 |journal=[[Mycologia]] |publisher=[[New York Botanical Garden]] |volume=14 |page=203}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
''A. campestris'' is found in fields and grassy areas after rain from late summer onwards worldwide. It is often found on lawns in suburban areas, appearing in small groups, in [[fairy ring]]s,<ref name="Fox 2006" /> or solitary. Owing to the demise of horse-drawn vehicles, and the subsequent decrease in the number of horses on pasture, the old "white outs" of years gone by are becoming rare events.<ref name="Mabey 1972" /> This species is rarely found in [[woodland]].

The mushroom has been reported from Asia, Europe, northern Africa, Australia,<ref>{{cite book | author=J. H.

Additionally, specimens collected from lawns could be contaminated by pesticides or other chemicals.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Culinary uses include eating it sauteed or fried, in sauces, or even sliced raw and included in salads. In flavor and texture, this mushroom is similar to the [[white button mushroom]] (''A. bisporus'') available in grocery stores in most Western countries.<ref name="Oregon">{{cite book |last=Meuninck |first=Jim |title=Foraging Mushrooms Oregon: Finding, Identifying, and Preparing Edible Wild Mushrooms |date=2017 |publisher=[[Falcon Guides]] |isbn=978-1-4930-2669-2 |page=107}}</ref>

=== Other uses ===
Research into fungal dressings for the treatment of ulcers, and bed sores, using fungal mycelial filaments, is ongoing.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the past, slices of ''A.&nbsp;campestris'' were applied to scalds and burns in parts of Scotland.<ref name="Harding 2008" />

=== Bioactive properties ===
Water extracts of ''A. campestris'' have been shown to enhance the secretion of [[insulin]], and to have insulin-like effects on [[glucose metabolism]] ''[[in vitro]]'', although the mechanism is not understood.<ref name="Gray 1998"/>
