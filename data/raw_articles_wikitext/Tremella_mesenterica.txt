'''''Tremella mesenterica''''' ([[common name]]s include '''yellow brain''', '''golden jelly fungus''', '''yellow trembler''', and '''witches' butter'''<ref>Alternatively spelled ''witch's'' or ''witches''</ref>) is a common [[jelly fungus]] in the family [[Tremellaceae]] of the [[Agaricomycotina]]. The gelatinous, orange-yellow fruit body of the fungus, which can grow up to {{convert|7.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} diameter, has a convoluted or lobed surface that is greasy or slimy when damp.

It is most frequently found on both dead but attached and recently fallen branches, especially of [[angiosperm]]s, as a [[parasite]] of [[wood-decay fungi]] in the genus ''[[Peniophora]]''. It also grows in crevices in bark, appearing during rainy weather. Within a few days after rain it dries into a thin film or shriveled mass capable of reviving after subsequent rain. This fungus occurs widely in [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[mixed forest]]s and is widely distributed in [[temperate]] and [[tropical]] regions, including those of Eurasia, Africa, Australia, and the Americas. The fungus is potentially [[edible mushroom|edible]] and produces [[carbohydrate]]s that have attracted research interest because of their various [[biological activity]].

The species was originally described in 1769 from Sweden by [[Anders Jahan Retzius]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/178907#page/277/mode/1up|title = Kungl.

This latter name is also applied to both ''[[Exidia glandulosa]]'' and ''[[Fuligo septica]]'', and stems from Swedish and Scandinavian folklore surrounding witchcraft, in which a bile spewed up by thieving ''"carriers"'' or [[Troll cat|troll cats]] is referred to as, ''"butter of the witches."''<blockquote>—They confessed also, that the devil gives them a beast, about the shape and bigness of a cat, which they call a carrier ; and he gives them a bird, too, as big as a raven, but white : And these creatures they can send any where and wherever they come, they take away all sorts of victuals they can get, as butter, cheese, milk, bacon, and all sorts of seeds, whatever they can find, and carry it to the witches. What the bird brings, they may keep for themselves : but what the carrier brings, they must reserve for the devil, and that is brought to [[Blockula]], where he gives them of it as much as he thinks fit. —They added, that the carriers filled themselves so full oftentimes, that they are forced to spew by the way, which spewing is found in several gardens, where colworts grow, and not far from the houses of the witches. It is of a yellow colour like gold, and is called the butter of the witches.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sinclair|first=George|url=https://wellcomecollection.org/works/gd83vbuk/items?canvas=131|title=Satan's invisible world discovered, or, A choice collection of modern relations proving evidently, against the atheists of this present age, that there are devils.

===Etymology===

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is a [[Latin]] adjective formed from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{lang|grc|μεσεντέριον}} (''mesentérion''), "middle intestine", from {{lang|grc|μεσο-}} (''meso-'', "middle, center") and {{lang|grc|ἔντερον}} (''énteron'', "intestine"), referring to its shape.<ref name="OED" /><ref name="Roody2003" />

==Description==

The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] has an irregular shape, and usually breaks through the [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of dead branches. It is up to {{convert|7.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} broad and {{convert|2.5 to 5|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} high, rounded to variously lobed or brain-like in appearance. The fruit body is gelatin-like but tough when wet, and hard when dry. The surface is usually smooth, the lobes translucent, deep yellow or bright yellow-orange, fading to pale yellow, rarely unpigmented and white or colorless. The fruit bodies dry to a dark reddish or orange. The [[spore]]s, viewed in mass, are whitish or pale yellow.<ref name="Kuo"/>

===Life cycle===

''Tremella mesenterica'' has a yeastlike phase in its [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] that arises as a result of [[budding]] of basidiospores. The alternation between asexual and sexual propagation is achieved by mating of yeast-form [[haploid]] cells of two compatible [[mating type]]s.<ref name="Bandoni1965"/> Each mating type secretes a mating pheromone that elicits sexual differentiation of the target cell having the opposite mating type to the [[pheromone]]-producing cell. The sexual differentiation is characterized by the arrest of the growth in the [[G1 phase]] of the [[cell division cycle]] and subsequent formation of an elongated mating tube. Formation of the mating tube, initiated by the pheromones {{nowrap|A-10}} and {{nowrap|a-13}}, is similar to the process of bud emergence during bipolar budding in yeasts.<ref name=Hirata1980/> Tremerogen {{nowrap|A-10}} has been purified and its [[chemical structure]] found to be ''S''-poly[[isoprenyl]] [[peptide]].<ref name="Sakagami1979"/> Fruit bodies arise from a [[wikt:primordium|primordium]] located beneath the wood bark, and sometimes more than one fruit body can originate separately from the same primordia.<ref name="Bandoni1998"/>

===Microscopic characteristics===

The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are ellipsoid to roughly spherical in shape, not or rarely stalked, and typically 15–21&nbsp;[[μm]] wide. They contain two to four septa that divide it into compartments; the septa are most frequently diagonal or vertical. Asexual reproduction in ''T.&nbsp;mesenterica'' is carried out through the formation of spores called [[conidia]], which arise from [[conidiophore]]s—specialized hyphal cells that are [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] distinct from the somatic hyphae.  The conidiophores are densely branched and normally abundant in the [[hymenium]]; young specimens may be entirely conidial. The conidia are roughly spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoid, and about 2–3 by 2–2.5&nbsp;μm.  They may be so numerous that young fruit bodies may be covered in a bright yellow, conidial slime. The [[ascospore|spores]] are broadly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to oblong, on average 10–16 by 6–9.5&nbsp;μm; they germinate by [[germ tube]] or by yeast-like conidia of identical form to the conidia produced on the conidiophores.<ref name="Roberts1995"/>

''Tremella mesenterica''  is frequently confused with ''[[Tremella aurantia]]'', a widespread species [[parasitic]] on the [[plant pathogen]]ic fungus ''[[Stereum hirsutum]]''. ''Tremella aurantia'' can often be recognized by the presence of its host, which typically grows on logs, stumps, and trunks. Though the two species are similarly colored, the surface of ''T.&nbsp;aurantia'' is usually matte, not greasy or shiny, and its lobes or folds are thicker than those of ''T.&nbsp;mesenterica''. Fruit bodies of ''T.&nbsp;aurantia'' contain unclamped, thick-walled host hyphae and consequently retain their shape when dried, rather than shriveling or collapsing to a film (as in ''T. mesenterica''). Microscopically, ''T.&nbsp;aurantia'' has smaller basidia and smaller, differently shaped spores measuring 8.5–10 by 7–8.5&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Bandoni1998"/><ref name="Roberts1995"/><ref name="Smith2005"/> ''[[Tremella brasiliensis|T.&nbsp;brasiliensis]]'', known from [[neotropical]] areas and Japan, and the North American species ''[[Tremella mesenterella|T.&nbsp;mesenterella]]'' are also similar.<ref name="Bandoni1998"/>

''Tremella mesenterica'' may also be confused with members of the family [[Dacrymycetaceae]], like ''[[Dacrymyces chrysospermus]]'' (formerly ''D.&nbsp;palmatus''), due to their superficial resemblance.<ref name="Kuo"/> Microscopic examination shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have Y-shaped basidia with two spores, unlike the longitudinally split basidia characteristic of ''Tremella'';<ref name="Orr1979"/> additionally, ''D.&nbsp;chrysospermus'' is smaller, has a whitish attachment point to its [[substrate (biology)|substrate]], and grows on [[conifer]] wood.<ref name="Kuo"/>

''[[Naematelia aurantia]]'' is less frequently translucent and can be distinguished by host.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=87}}</ref>

==Habitat and distribution==
]]

''Tremella mesenterica'' has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], having been recorded from North, Central, and South America, Africa, Europe, Asia, and Australia.<ref name="Roberts1995"/><ref name="Lowy1971"/> Fruit bodies are formed during wet periods throughout the year. In [[British Columbia]], Canada, it is sometimes found on [[maple]], [[Populus|poplar]], or [[pine]], but is most abundant on [[red alder]].<ref name="Bandoni1976"/> It prefers to grow in habitats ranging from [[mesic habitat|mesic]] to wet.<ref name="Bandoni1998"/> The fungus grows parasitically on the [[mycelium]] of wood-rotting [[corticioid fungi]] in the genus ''[[Peniophora]]''.<ref name="Zugmaier1994"/> Occasionally, ''T.&nbsp;mesenterica'' and its host fungus are found fruiting together.<ref name="TVFoTM Oct 2000"/>

===Bioactive compounds===
Some ''Tremella'' species produce [[polysaccharide]]s that are of interest to the medical field, because of their [[biological activity]]; several patents have been filed in China pertaining to the use of these compounds for cancer prevention or [[immune system]] enhancement.<ref name=DeBaets2001/> In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of ''T.&nbsp;mesenterica'' that closely resembled those produced by the species ''[[Cryptococcus laurentii]]''. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them.<ref name=Slodki1966/> Subsequently, researchers [[organic synthesis|chemically synthesized]] the polysaccharide,<ref name=Fraser1973/> and determined the chemical identities of the component [[monosaccharide|sugar units]].<ref name=Cherniak1988/> The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan—produced by fruit bodies and in [[microbiological culture|pure culture]] conditions—has been shown to consist of a [[Mannan (polysaccharide)|mannan]] backbone that is [[glycosylated]] with [[xylan]] chains in a regular repeating structure.<ref name=Vinogradov2004/> Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with ''T.&nbsp;mesenterica'' glucuronoxylomannan, including [[immunostimulatory]], [[antidiabetic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[Hypocholesterolemia|hypocholesterolemic]], [[hepatoprotective]], and [[antiallergic]] effects.<ref name=Wasser2002/><ref name=Vinogradov2004b>{{cite journal |vauthors=Vinogradov E, Petersen BO, Duus JØ, Wasser SP |year=2004 |title=The isolation, structure, and applications of the exocellular heteropolysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan produced by yellow brain mushroom ''Tremella mesenterica'' Ritz.:Fr.
