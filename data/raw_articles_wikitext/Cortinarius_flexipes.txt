'''''Cortinarius flexipes''''' is a fungus, specifically a [[mushroom]], a small brown species in the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''. It is commonly known as the '''Pelargonium webcap''' because of its unusual smell of ''[[Pelargonium]]'' (the household "geranium").

This species of mushroom is found in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. It is [[hygrophanous]], and  belongs to the ''Telamonia'' group, being thin-fleshed and having a dry [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]].
