'''''Boletus edulis''''' (English: '''cep''', '''penny bun''', '''porcino''') is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus, and the [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Boletus]]''. It is prized as an [[edible mushroom]]. 

The fungus produces [[Basidiospore|spore]]-bearing [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] above ground in summer and autumn. The fruit body has a large brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] which on occasion can reach {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}}, rarely {{convert|40|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|3|kg|lboz|abbr=on}} in weight. Like other [[bolete]]s, it has tubes extending downward from the underside of the cap, rather than gills; spores escape at maturity through the tube openings, or pores. The pore surface of the ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' fruit body is whitish when young, but ages to a greenish-yellow. The stout [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], or stem, is white or yellowish in colour, up to {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}}, rarely {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|10|cm|0|abbr=on}} thick, and partially covered with a raised network pattern, or [[wikt:reticulate|reticulations]].

The fungus grows in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[conifer]]ous forests and tree [[plantation]]s, forming [[symbiotic]] [[ectomycorrhiza]]l associations with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. Widely distributed in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] across Eurasia and North America, it does not occur naturally in the Southern Hemisphere, although it has been [[introduced species|introduced]] to southern Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil. Several closely related European mushrooms formerly thought to be [[variety (botany)|varieties]] or [[form (botany)|forms]] of ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' have been shown using [[molecular phylogenetic]] analysis to be distinct species, and others previously classed as separate species are [[wikt:conspecific|conspecific]] with this species. The western North American species commonly known as the California king bolete (''Boletus edulis'' var. ''grandedulis'') is a large, darker-coloured variant first formally identified in 2007.

''B.&nbsp;edulis'' is held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in [[soups]], pasta, or [[risotto]]. The mushroom is low in fat and digestible [[carbohydrate]]s, and high in [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral|mineral]]s and [[dietary fibre]]. Although it is sold commercially, it is very difficult to [[fungiculture|cultivate]]. Available fresh in autumn throughout Europe and Russia, it is most often dried, packaged, and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' is also one of the few fungi sold [[pickled]].

==Taxonomy==


''Boletus edulis'' was first [[species description|described]] in 1782 by the French botanist [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] and still bears its original name.<ref>{{cite book |title=Herbier de la France. Vol 2|author=Bulliard JBF.|year=1782|publisher=P.F.

It was thus written ''Boletus edulis'' Bull.:Fr. A 1987 revision of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] set the starting date at May&nbsp;1, 1753, the date of publication of [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]' work, the ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.<ref>{{cite book |vauthors=Esser K, Lemke PA |title= The Mycota: A Comprehensive Treatise on Fungi as Experimental Systems for Basic and Applied Research |url=https://archive.org/details/mossflorabritain00libg |url-access=limited |publisher = Springer|location=Heidelberg, Germany |year=1994|page=[https://archive.org/details/mossflorabritain00libg/page/n93 81]|isbn = 3-540-66493-9}}</ref> Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries' authority.

''Boletus edulis'' is the [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Boletus]]''.

==Description==


The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of this mushroom is {{convert|7–30|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} broad at maturity. Slightly sticky to touch, it is convex in shape when young and flattens with age. The colour is generally reddish-brown fading to white in areas near the margin, and continues to darken as it matures. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]], or stem, is {{convert|8–25|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} in height, and up to {{convert|7|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} thick—rather large in comparison to the cap;<ref name=Kozikowski1996/> it is club-shaped, or bulges out in the middle. It is finely [[wikt:reticulate|reticulate]] on the upper portion, but smooth or irregularly ridged on the lower part. The under surface of the cap is made of thin tubes, the site of [[Basidiospore|spore]] production; they are {{convert|1 to 2|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} deep, and whitish in colour when young, but mature to a greenish-yellow.<ref name=Grund1976/> The angular pores, which do not stain when bruised, are small—roughly 2 to 3 pores per millimetre.<ref name=Tylutki1987II>{{cite book|title=Mushrooms of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.

The spore print is olive brown. The flesh of the fruit body is white, thick and firm when young, but becomes somewhat spongy with age. When bruised or cut, it either does not change colour, or turns a very light brown or light red.<ref name=Wang1995/> Fully mature specimens can weigh about {{convert|1|kg|lboz|abbr=on}}; a huge specimen collected on the [[Isle of Skye]], Scotland, in 1995 bore a cap of {{convert|42|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}}, with a stipe {{convert|18|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|14|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} wide, and weighed {{convert|3.2|kg|lboz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Kozikowski1996>{{cite journal|author=Kozikowski GR.|year=1996 |title=Foray Report from Skye |journal=Mycologist |volume=10 |pages=183–84 |doi=10.1016/S0269-915X(96)80022-X |issue=4}}</ref> A similarly sized specimen found in Poland in 2013 made international news.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-24292021 | title=Giant mushroom found in Poland| work=BBC News}}</ref>

''Boletus edulis'' is considered one of the safest wild mushrooms to pick for the table, as few poisonous species closely resemble it, and those that do may be easily distinguished by careful examination.<ref name = "Carluccio03"/> The most similar poisonous mushroom may be the devil's bolete (''[[Rubroboletus satanas]]''), which has a similar shape, but has a red stem and stains blue on bruising.<ref name="Carluccio03" /> It is often confused with the very bitter and unpalatable ''[[Tylopilus felleus]]'', but can be distinguished by the reticulation on the stalk; in porcini, it is a whitish, net-like pattern on a brownish stalk, whereas it is a dark pattern on white in the latter. Porcini have whitish pores while the other has pink. If in doubt, tasting a tiny bit of flesh will yield a bitter taste.<ref name = "Carluccio03"/> It can also resemble the "bolete-like" ''[[Gyroporus castaneus]]'', which is generally smaller, and has a browner stem. ''[[Boletus huronensis]],'' an uncommon mushroom of northeastern North America, is another recognized look-alike known to cause severe [[gastrointestinal disorder]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://namyco.org/boletus_huronensis.php|title=''Boletus huronensis'': Comments on its toxicity with diagnostic images of its field characteristics and staining reactions|author=Bill Bakaitis|publisher=North American Mycological Association|date=2019}}</ref>

The spores are elliptical to spindle-shaped, with dimensions of 12–17 by 5–7&nbsp;[[μm]]. The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are produced in a layer lining the tubes, and arrange themselves so their ends are facing the center of the tube; this layer of cells is known technically as a [[hymenium]]. The basidia are thin-walled, mostly attached to four spores, and measure 25–30 by 8–10&nbsp;μm. Another cell type present in the hymenium is the cystidia, larger sterile cells that protrude beyond the basidia into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the hymenium, and act as air traps, regulating humidity.<ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Alexopoulos CJ, Mims CW, Blackwell M | title=Introductory Mycology | year=1996 | publisher=John Wiley and Sons |location=New York|page=495 | isbn=0-471-52229-5}}</ref> ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' has pleurocystidia (cystidia located on the face of a pore) that are thin-walled, roughly spindle-shaped to [[ventricose]], and measure 30–45 by 7–10&nbsp;μm; the "stuffed" feature of the hymenium is caused by cheilocystidia—cells found on the edges of the pores.<ref name=Grund1976>{{cite book |title=Nova Scotian Boletes |vauthors=Grund DW, Harrison AK |year=1976 |publisher=J.

Several similar brownish-coloured species are sometimes considered subspecies or forms of this mushroom. In Europe, in addition to ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' (or ''cèpe de Bordeaux''), the most popular are:
*''Cèpe bronzé'' ("dark cep"; ''[[Boletus aereus]]''), much rarer than ''B.&nbsp;edulis'', is more highly regarded by gourmets, and consequently more expensive. Usually smaller than ''B.&nbsp;edulis'', it is also distinctively darker in colour.<ref name = "Carluccio03"/> It is especially suited to drying.<ref name=Zeitl76/>

===Mycorrhizal associations===
''Boletus edulis'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l—it is in a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the roots of plants (hosts), in which the fungus exchanges [[nitrogen]] and other nutrients extracted from the environment for [[carbon fixation|fixed carbon]] from the host. Other benefits for the plant are evident: in the case of the [[Castanea mollissima|Chinese chestnut]], the formation of mycorrhizae with ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' increases the ability of plant seedlings to resist [[moisture stress|water stress]], and increases leaf [[succulent plants|succulence]], leaf area, and water-holding ability.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Quan L, Lei ZP |year=2000 |title=A study on effect of ectomycorrhizae on promoting ''Castanea mollissima'' resistance to drought and its mechanism |journal=Forest Research |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=249–56 |issn=1001-1498|language=zh}}</ref> The fungus forms a sheath of tissue around terminal, nutrient-absorbing root tips, often inducing a high degree of branching in the tips of the host, and penetrating into the root tissue, forming, to some mycologists, the defining feature of ectomycorrhizal relationships, a [[hartig net]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Smith, Sally; Read, David.

The mushroom has been noted to often co-occur with ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' or ''[[Amanita rubescens|A.&nbsp;rubescens]]'', although it is unclear whether this is due to a biological association between the species, or because of similarities in growing season, habitat, and ecological requirements.<ref name=Hall1998/> An association has also been reported between ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' and ''[[Amanita excelsa var. spissa|Amanita excelsa]]'' on ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' ectomycorrhizae in New Zealand, suggesting that other fungi may influence the life cycle of porcini.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hall IR, Wang Y, Amicucci A |year=2003 |title=Cultivation of edible ectomycorrhizal mushrooms |journal=Trends in Biotechnology |volume=21 |issue=10|pages=433–38 |doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(03)00204-X|pmid=14512229}}</ref> A 2007 field study revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies were more complex.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Peintner U, Iotti M, Klotz P, Bonuso E, Zambonelli A |year=2007 |title=Soil fungal communities in a ''Castanea sativa'' (chestnut) forest producing large quantities of ''Boletus edulis sensu lato'' (porcini): where is the mycelium of porcini? |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=880–89 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01208.x|pmid=17359260 |bibcode=2007EnvMi...9..880P }}</ref>

===Heavy-metal contamination===
''Boletus edulis'' is known to be able to tolerate and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal [[smelters]]. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-[[metal toxicity]] is conferred by a biochemical called a [[phytochelatin]]—an [[oligopeptide]] whose production is induced after exposure to metal.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Collin-Hansen C, Pedersen SA, Andersen RA, Steinnes E |year=2007 |title=First report of phytochelatins in a mushroom: induction of phytochelatins by metal exposure in ''Boletus edulis'' |journal=Mycologia |volume=99 |issue=2 |pages=161–74|doi=10.3852/mycologia.99.2.161 |pmid=17682769}}</ref> Phytochelatins are [[chelating]] agents, capable of forming [[coordination complex|multiple bonds]] with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a detoxified form in the mushroom tissue.{{Cn|date=December 2024}}

===Pests and predators===
The fruit bodies of ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' can be infected by the parasitic mould-like fungus ''[[Hypomyces chrysospermus]]'', known as the bolete eater, which manifests itself as a white, yellow, or reddish-brown cottony layer over the surface of the mushroom.<ref name="urlHypomyces chrysospermus (MushroomExpert.Com)">{{cite web |url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/hypomyces_chrysospermus.html |title=''Hypomyces chrysospermus'' |author=Kuo M |work= MushroomExpert.Com|access-date=2009-11-02}}</ref> Some reported cases of [[Abdominal pain|stomach ache]] following consumption of dried porcini have been attributed to the presence of this mould on the fruit bodies.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lunghini D, Onofri S, Zucconi L |year=1984 |title= Some cases of intoxication probably caused by ''Sepedonium'' spp. infecting fruiting-bodies of some species of ''Boletus'' |journal=Micologia Italiana |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=1/37–1/38 |issn=0390-0460|language=it}}</ref> The mushroom is also used as a food source by several species of mushroom flies,<ref name=Hall1998/> as well as other insects and their [[larva]]e.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fungus-Insect Relationships: Perspectives in Ecology and Evolution |author=Bruns TD. |veditors=Wheeler Q, Blackwell M |chapter=Insect mycophagy in the Boletales: fungivore diversity and the mushroom habitat |year=1984 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-231-05695-3|pages=91–129}}</ref> An unidentified species of virus was reported to have infected specimens found in the Netherlands and in Italy; fruit bodies affected by the virus had relatively thick stems and small or no caps, leading to the name "little-cap disease".<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Huttinga H, Wichers HJ, Dieleman van Zaayen A |year=1975 |title=Filamentous and polyhedral virus-like particle in ''Boletus edulis'' |journal=Netherlands Journal of Plant Pathology |volume=81 |pages=102–106|doi=10.1007/BF01999860 |issue=3|bibcode=1975EJPP...81..102H |s2cid=35794592 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Pisi A, Bellardi ME, Bernicchia A |year=1988 |title=Virus-like particles in ''Boletus edulis'' Bull. ex Fr. in Italy |journal=Phytopathologia Mediterranea |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=115–18 |issn=0031-9465|url=http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/reprint/94/5/757.pdf|access-date=2009-11-03}}</ref>

''Boletus edulis'', as the species [[Botanical name#Components of plant names|epithet]] ''edulis'' ({{langx|la|edible}}) indicates, is an edible mushroom. Italian chef and restaurateur [[Antonio Carluccio]] described it as representing "the wild mushroom par excellence", and hailed it as the most rewarding of all fungi in the kitchen for its taste and versatility.<ref name = "Carluccio03"/> Considered a choice edible, particularly in France, Germany, Poland and Italy,<ref name=Zeitl76/> it was widely written about by the Roman writers [[Pliny the Elder]] and Martial, although ranked below the esteemed ''[[Amanita caesarea]]''.

The flavour of porcini has been described as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture, and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of [[sourdough]]. Young, small porcini are most appreciated, as the large ones often harbour [[maggot]]s (insect larvae), and become slimy, soft and less tasty with age. The fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base and twisting gently. Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed. Peeling and washing are not recommended.<ref name="Carluccio03" /> The fruit bodies are highly [[decomposition|perishable]], due largely to the high water content (around 90%), the high level of [[enzyme]] activity, and the presence of a flora of microorganisms.<ref name=Jaworska2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jaworska G, Bernaś E |year=2008 |title=The effect of preliminary processing and period of storage on the quality of frozen ''Boletus edulis'' (Bull: Fr.) mushrooms |journal=Food Chemistry |volume=113 |issue=4 |pages=936–43 |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2008.08.023}}</ref> Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or [[Soil contamination|contaminated]] sites, as several studies have shown that the fruit bodies can [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] toxic heavy metals like [[mercury (element)|mercury]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Melgar MJ, Alonson J, Garcia MA |year=2009 |title=Mercury in edible mushrooms and underlying soil: Bioconcentration factors and toxicological risk |journal=Science of the Total Environment |volume=407 |issue=1 |pages=5328–34 |doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2009.07.001|pmid=19631362|bibcode=2009ScTEn.407.5328M }}</ref> [[cadmium]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Collin-Hansen C, Yttri KE, Andersen RA, Berthelsen BO, Steinnes E |year=2002 |title=Mushrooms from two metal-contaminated areas in Norway: occurrence of metals and metallothionein-like proteins |journal=Geochemistry: Exploration, Environment, Analysis |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages= 121–30|doi=10.1144/1467-787302-015|bibcode=2002GEEA....2..121C |s2cid=129662148 }}</ref> [[caesium]] and [[polonium]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Collin-Hansen C, Andersen RA, Steinnes E |year=2005 |title=Molecular defense systems are expressed in the king bolete (''Boletus edulis'') growing near metal smelters |journal=Mycologia |volume=97 |issue=5|pages=973–83|doi=10.3852/mycologia.97.5.973 |pmid=16596949 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Collin-Hansen C, Andersen RA, Steinnes E |year=2005 |title=Damage to DNA and lipids in ''Boletus edulis'' exposed to heavy metals |journal=Mycological Research |volume=109 |issue=12 |pages=1386–96 |doi= 10.1017/S0953756205004016|pmid=16353638}}</ref> Bioaccumulated metals or [[radionuclide|radioactive fission decay products]] are like chemical signatures: [[analytical chemistry|chemical]] and [[radiochemistry|radiochemical]] analysis can be used to identify the origin of imported specimens,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Marzano FN, Bracchi PG, Pizzetti P |year=2001 |title=Radioactive and conventional pollutants accumulated by edible mushrooms (''Boletus'' sp.) are useful indicators of species origin |journal=Environmental Research |pmid=11237515 |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=260–64 |doi=10.1006/enrs.2001.4233|bibcode=2001ER.....85..260M }}</ref> and for long-term [[radioecology|radioecological]] monitoring of polluted areas.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Grodzinskaya AA, Berreck M, Haselwandter K, Wasser SP |year=2003 |title=Radiocesium contamination of wild-growing medicinal mushrooms in Ukraine |journal=International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=61–86 |issn=1521-9437 |doi=10.1615/InterJMedicMush.v5.i1.90}}</ref>

===Dried===

''Boletus edulis'' is well suited to drying—its flavour intensifies, it is easily reconstituted, and its resulting texture is pleasant.<ref>Carluccio, p. 96.</ref> Reconstitution is done by soaking in hot, but not boiling, water for about twenty minutes; the water used is infused with the mushroom aroma and it too can be used in subsequent cooking. Dried porcini have more protein than most other commonly consumed vegetables, apart from [[soybean]]s. Some of their protein is indigestible, though digestibility is improved with cooking.<ref name=Arora86>{{cite book |author=Arora D. |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/530/mode/2up |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |year=1986 |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=530–31}}</ref>

Like other boletes, porcini can be dried by being strung separately on twine and hung close to the ceiling of a kitchen. Alternatively, the mushrooms can be dried by cleaning with a brush (washing is not recommended), and then placing them in a wicker basket or [[bamboo steamer]] on top of a boiler or hot water tank.<ref name=Carluccio97>Carluccio, p. 97.</ref> Another method is drying in an oven at {{convert|25 to 30|C|F}} for two to three hours, then increasing the temperature to {{convert|50|C|F}} until crisp or brittle.<ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Gates L, Delong D |title=How to Dry Foods |publisher=HP Books |location=Los Angeles, California |year=1992 |page=61 |isbn=1-55788-050-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aSBfsPQP_MQC&q=cooking%20Boletus%20edulis&pg=PA61 |access-date=2009-10-06}}</ref> Once dry, they must be kept in an airtight container.<ref name=Carluccio97/> Importantly for commercial production, porcini retain their flavour after industrial preparation in a [[pressure cooker]] or after canning or bottling, and are thus useful for manufacturers of soups or stews. The addition of a few pieces of dried porcino can significantly add to flavour, and they are a major ingredient of the pasta sauce known as ''carrettiera'' (carter's sauce).<ref>{{cite book |author=Seed D. |title=The Top One Hundred Pasta Sauces |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, California |year=1987 |page=25 |isbn=0-89815-232-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5JfdNVZlwA0C&q=cooking%20Boletus%20edulis&pg=PA25 |access-date=2010-11-06}}</ref> The drying process is known to induce the formation of various [[volatile organic compound|volatile substances]] that contribute to the mushroom's aroma.

===Commercial harvest===


A 1998 estimate suggested that the total annual worldwide consumption of ''Boletus edulis'' and closely related species (''B.&nbsp;aereus'', ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'', and ''B.&nbsp;reticulatus'') was between 20,000 and 100,000 tons.<ref name=Hall1998/> Approximately 2,700&nbsp;tonnes (3,000&nbsp;[[Short ton|tons]]) were sold in France, Italy and Germany in 1988, according to official figures. The true amount consumed far exceeds this, as the official sales figures did not account for informal sales or consumption by collectors.<ref name=Hall2003/> They are widely exported and sold in dried form, reaching countries where they do not occur naturally, such as Australia and New Zealand. The autonomous community of [[Castile and León]] in Spain produces 7,700&nbsp;tonnes (8,500&nbsp;tons) annually.<ref name=Agueda2008>{{cite journal |vauthors=Agueda B, Parlade J, Fernandez-Toiran LM, Cisneros O, de Miguel AM, Modrego MP, Martinez-Pena F, Pera J |year=2008 |title=Mycorrhizal synthesis between ''Boletus edulis'' species complex and rockroses (''Cistus'' sp.) |journal=Mycorrhiza |pmid=18695982 |volume=18 |issue=8 |pages=443–49 |doi=10.1007/s00572-008-0192-3|bibcode=2008Mycor..18..443A |s2cid=11233267 }}</ref> In autumn, the price of porcini in the Northern Hemisphere typically ranges between $20 and $80&nbsp;per kilogram, although in New York in 1997 the wholesale price rose to more than $200 per kilogram due to scarcity.<ref name=Hall2003/>

In the vicinity of [[Borgo Val di Taro|Borgotaro]] in the [[Province of Parma]] of northern Italy, the four species ''Boletus edulis'', ''B.&nbsp;aereus'', ''B.&nbsp;aestivalis'' and ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed ''Fungo di Borgotaro''. Here these mushrooms have been collected for centuries and exported commercially. Owing to the globalisation of the mushroom trade most of the porcini commercially available in Italy or exported by Italy no longer originate there. Porcini and other mushrooms are also imported into Italy from various locations, especially China and eastern European countries; these are then often re-exported under the "Italian porcini" label.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sitta N, Floriani M |year=2008 |title=Nationalization and globalization trends in the wild mushroom commerce of Italy with emphasis on porcini (''Boletus edulis'' and allied species) |journal=Economic Botany |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=307–22 |doi=10.1007/s12231-008-9037-4|bibcode=2008EcBot..62..307S |s2cid=44274570 }}</ref><ref name=Boa2004>{{cite book |author= Boa E. |title=Wild Edible Fungi: A Global Overview of Their Use and Importance to People (Non-Wood Forest Products) |publisher=Food & Agriculture Organization of the UN |location=Rome, Italy |year=2004 |pages=96–97 |isbn=92-5-105157-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zd2NlcNZgvcC&q=boletus%20edulis&pg=PA97|access-date=2009-10-30}}</ref>

In Italy the disconnect with local production has had an adverse effect on quality; for example in the 1990s some of the dried porcino mushrooms exported to Italy from China contained species of genus ''[[Tylopilus]]'', which are rather similar in appearance and when dried are difficult for both mushroom labourers and mycologists alike to distinguish from ''Boletus''. ''Tylopilus'' species typically have a very bitter taste, which is imparted to the flavour of the porcini with which they are mixed.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sitta N. |year=2000 |title=Presence of ''Tylopilus'' into dried "Porcini" mushrooms from China |journal=Micologia Italiana |volume=29 |issue=1 |pages=96–99 |issn=0390-0460|language=it}}</ref>

After the [[revolutions of 1989|fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the subsequent reduction of economic and political barriers, central and eastern European countries with local mushroom harvesting traditions, such as Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Romania, Serbia and Slovenia, developed into exporters of porcini, concentrating primarily on the Italian market.<ref name=Boa2004/> Porcini and other wild fungi from these countries are also destined for France, Germany and other western European markets, where demand for them exists but collection on a commercial scale does not.<ref name=Boa2004/> Picking ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' has become an annual seasonal income earner and pastime in countries like [[Bulgaria]], especially for many [[Romani people|Roma]] communities and the [[unemployment|unemployed]].<ref name=belogradchik>{{cite web |url=http://www.belogradchik.info/1/content/view/390/2/lang,bg/ |language=bg |title=''По 1 тон гъби на ден се предават в изкупвателните пунктове в Белоградчик'' |trans-title=One ton of mushrooms a day are being submitted to purchasing stations in Belogradchik |author=Focus Information Agency, Bulgaria |work=Belogradchik.info |access-date=2009-11-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721185827/http://www.belogradchik.info/1/content/view/390/2/lang%2Cbg/ |archive-date=2011-07-21 }}</ref> A lack of control of the harvest has led to heavy exploitation of the mushroom resource.<ref name=worldwildlife>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/bsp/publications/europe/bulgaria/bulgaria1.html |title=The Macromycetes Fungi of Bulgaria |vauthors=Drumeva M, Gyosheva M |work= World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2009-11-27}}</ref>

== Nutrition==
''Boletus edulis'' mushrooms are 9% [[carbohydrate]]s, 3% fat, and 7% [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] (table). Fresh mushrooms consist of over 80% moisture,<ref name=Ouzouni2006>{{cite journal |vauthors=Ouzouni PK, Riganakos KA |year=2006 |title=Nutritional value and metal content profile of Greek wild edible fungi |journal=Acta Alimentaria |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=99–110 |doi=10.1556/AAlim.36.2007.1.11}}</ref> although reported values tend to differ somewhat as moisture content can be affected by environmental temperature and [[relative humidity]] during growth and storage.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Biology and Cultivation of Edible Mushrooms |vauthors=Crisan EV, Sands A |year=1978|veditors=Chang ST, Hayes WA |chapter=Nutritional value |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-12-168050-3|pages=727–93}}</ref> The carbohydrate component contains the [[monosaccharide]]s [[glucose]], [[mannitol]] and α,α-[[trehalose]], the [[polysaccharide]] [[glycogen]], and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide [[chitin]], which accounts for up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom [[cell wall]]s.
