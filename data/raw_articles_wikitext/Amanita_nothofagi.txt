'''''Amanita nothofagi''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Amanitaceae]]. [[Endemism|Endemic]] to New Zealand, the species was first described by mycologist [[Greta Stevenson]] in 1962. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have dark brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are up to {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and covered with patches of soft greyish-brown scales or warts. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] underneath the cap are crowded together, free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and white, becoming tinged with yellow in age. The stem of the mushroom is {{convert|4|–|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.5|–|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and has a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[spore print]] is white, and individual spores are spherical to ellipsoid, measuring 7.5–9 by 7.5–9 [[micrometre]]s. The mushroom may be confused with another New Zealand species, ''[[Amanita australis|A.&nbsp;australis]]'', but can be distinguished by certain characteristics. ''Amanita nothofagi'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species, and grows in association with native New Zealand trees such as [[southern beech]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[Species description|described]] as a new species by New Zealand mycologist [[Greta Stevenson]], who collected specimens in the mid-1950s in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]] and [[Cape Farewell, New Zealand|Cape Farewell]], via the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Royal Botanic Garden]]'s journal ''[[Kew Bulletin]]'' in 1962 (the second part of a five-part series of articles describing the mushroom [[flora]] of the country). The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''nothofagi'' refers to ''Nothofagus'', the genus of [[Southern beech]]es with which the species is often associated.<ref name="Stevenson1962" /> ''Amanita'' authority Rodham Tulloss uses the [[common name]] "southern beech Amanita",<ref name="urlAmanita nothofagi G. S. Ridl." /> while [[Geoff Ridley]] suggests "charcoal flycap".<ref name="Ridley2004" />

Stevenson [[classification (biology)|classified]] ''Amanita nothofagi'' in the section ''Phalloideae'' of the genus ''[[Amanita]]'',<ref name="Stevenson1962" /> but Ridley considered it better placed in section ''Validae'' because of its "subglobose basidiospores, a clavate or occasionally abruptly bulbous stipe base, with sparse bands or a rim of volva material".<ref name="Ridley1991" />

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''A.&nbsp;nothofagi'' is initially convex, later becoming flattened with a central depression, with radial grooves on the margin, reaching diameters of {{convert|3-13|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}}. The colour is variable, ranging from [[buff (color)|buff]] to dark grey to greyish-[[sepia (color)|sepia]], with radial streaks of dusky brownish grey. The cap surface is sticky when young or wet, but dries out with age. The remnants of the [[volva (mycology)|volva]] form small to large, irregularly shaped, [[felted]] patches, that are dull greyish-sepia to sepia, and sometimes scab-like. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded closely together, and free from attachment to the stem. They are white to cream-coloured, {{convert|6|–|10|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) have somewhat truncated ends.<ref name=Ridley1991/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4-14|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} high, {{convert|5|–|25|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick, and tapers slightly at the top. It is hollow and has a bulbous base measuring {{convert|10|–|30|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} in diameter. The stem surface above the level of the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is white, sparsely covered with woolly or fuzzy tufts, occasionally breaking into transverse bands; below the ring the stem surface is smooth or occasionally breaks into bands or [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] scales. It is whitish, buff or greyish-sepia streaked with grey. The stem base may or may not have a band or rim of buff to greyish-sepia volval remnants. The ring is membranous, grooved, whitish, buff, and greyish-sepia or lavender-grey. It first hangs freely before later sticking to the stem, often tearing and adhering to the edge of the cap. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap is white or stained mouse-grey under the central part, occasionally with a grey line above the gills; the stem flesh is white to pale buff.<ref name=Ridley1991/>

The [[spore print]] is white. The [[spore]]s are typically 7.5–9 by 7.5–9&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], spherical to broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid, and thin-walled. Under a [[light microscope|microscope]], the spores appear [[hyaline]] (translucent), and are amyloid—meaning they will turn bluish-black to black when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] are 30.5–57 by 8–16&nbsp;μm, four-spored, and not clamped at the base. The margin cells of the gills are plentiful, spherical, club-shaped or swollen spherically at the tip, hyaline, and measure 13–58 by 8–33&nbsp;μm. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] consists of a 130–220&nbsp;μm wide, strongly gelatinised suprapellis (upper layer) and a dense, non-gelatinised subpellis (lower layer). The volval remnants on the cap are made of abundant spherical, elliptic and club-shaped cells that are 21–119 by 14.5–115&nbsp;μm, intermixed with hyphae 4–9&nbsp;μm wide and pale umber in colour, and either arranged irregularly, or with a vertical orientation.<ref name=Ridley1991/>

''Amanita nothofagi'' mushrooms can be confused with ''[[Amanita australis|A.&nbsp;australis]]'' if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been bleached. A reliable method to distinguish the two is to check for the presence of clamp connections at the bases of the basidia, which are present in ''A.&nbsp;australis'' and absent from ''A.&nbsp;nothofagi''. Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen, and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species. Paler specimens resemble ''[[Amanita excelsa|A.&nbsp;excelsa]]'', which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand. ''[[Amanita luteofusca|A.&nbsp;luteofusca]]'' is also similar in appearance, spore size, amyloid reaction, and lack of clamp connections in the basidia. It is distinguished from ''A.&nbsp;nothofagi'' largely on the basis of colour; it is a greyish-brown to yellowish-grey brown that fades to pinkish-buff as it gets older.<ref name=Ridley1991/> Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share [[Gondwana]]n ancestors.<ref name="urlAmanita nothofagi G. S. Ridl."/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The fruit bodies of ''Amanita nothofagi'' grow solitarily or in scattered groups. Like all ''Amanita'' mushrooms, it is [[mycorrhiza]]l, and grows in close association with [[Southern Beech]] (genus ''[[Nothofagus]]'') (including [[Nothofagus fusca|New Zealand Red Beech]], [[Silver beech]], [[Nothofagus solandri|New Zealand Black Beech]], and [[Hard Beech]]), ''[[Leptospermum scoparium|Manuka]]'', and ''[[Kunzea ericoides|Kanuka]]''. Found on both the North and South islands of New Zealand, it is the most common of the country's [[endemism|endemic]] ''Amanita'' species.<ref name=Ridley1991/>
