'''''Leccinum vulpinum''''', commonly known as the '''foxy bolete''',<ref name="urlRecommended English Names for Fungi - Scottish Fungi"/> is a species of [[edible mushroom]]-forming [[fungus]] found in Europe. It is characterized by its muted fox-red [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with cocoa-brown tints, [[cream (color)|cream]]-coloured pore surface, and stout [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] covered with scales that darken from whitish to dark brown with age. This [[bolete]] is distinguished from its close relatives by its consistent association with conifers (especially Scots pine), subdued brown-reddish cap lacking vivid yellow-orange tones, and relatively narrow spores. Originally described by [[Roy Watling]] in 1961 from Scotland, it has since been recorded across several European countries including Poland, Portugal, Macedonia, and Montenegro.

==Taxonomy==

''Leccinum vulpinum'' was erected by [[Roy Watling]] in his 1961 revision of British [[bolete]] species. It falls within the genus ''[[Leccinum]]'', and is part of the ''[[Leccinum aurantiacum]]–[[Leccinum testaceoscabrum]]'' species complex. It is distinguished from its close relatives by its consistent association with [[conifer]]s (especially [[Scots pine]]), its subdued brown‑reddish cap lacking any vivid yellow‑orange tones, and its relatively narrow spores.<ref name="Watling 1961"/>

==Description==

The fruit bodies ([[basidiocarp]]s) have a cap ([[pileus (mycology)|pileus]]) measuring 30–90&nbsp;mm in diameter. The cap is convex at first, later broadly convex, with a dry surface covered in fine, woolly fibrils that are darkest at the centre. Its colour is a muted fox‑red with a cocoa‑brown tint, maturing to a deeper burnt [[sienna]]; bruising may produce a purplish‑sienna hue. On the cap underside, the pore surface beneath is pale [[cream (color)|cream]], with small, round pores that may faintly bruise [[lilac (color)|lilac]]. The tubes are 3–11&nbsp;mm long and are adnate (broadly attached) to scarcely free from the stipe.<ref name="Watling 1961"/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 85–135&nbsp;mm long and 13–22&nbsp;mm wide (up to 28&nbsp;mm at the base), stout and stuffed. It is pallid overall, slightly swollen towards the base, and bears fine scales that change from whitish to reddish‑brown and finally to dark brown or chocolate. The stipe base often bruises blue‑green.<ref name="Watling 1961"/>

[[trama (mycology)|Flesh]] throughout is white and may remain unchanging in the cap; when it does stain, changes are very slow—first to a pale pink or wine tint in the stipe apex, then to a blue‑green in the cortex at the base, and ultimately to a patchy steel‑blue. The odour is mild and pleasant, and the taste is gentle and not distinctive.<ref name="Watling 1961"/>

Microscopic features include spindle‑shaped (subfusiform) smooth [[spore]]s, about 12–16.5 by 3–4&nbsp;μm (brown [[spore print|in mass]]), four‑spored basidia 16.5–20 by 8–10&nbsp;μm, and ventricose to fusiform [[cystidia]] measuring 30–35 by 10–13.5&nbsp;μm (with a 2–3&nbsp;μm‑wide neck).<ref name="Watling 1961"/>

==Habitat and distribution==

''Leccinum vulpinum'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l with Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris]]''). It was originally recorded from dry, upland pine woods in [[Inverness-shire]], Scotland. Specimens were found among bilberry (''[[Vaccinium myrtillus]]'') beneath mature pines in the [[Rothiemurchus Forest|Rothiemurchus]] area and [[Cairngorms National Park]], with known collections dating from 1957 to 1960.<ref name="Watling 1961"/> An [[edible mushroom|edible]] species, it grows in [[mycorrhiza]]l association with species of [[pine]] and [[bearberry]].<ref name="Gry 2014"/> The fungus is known to have a broader European distribution and has been recorded from several additional countries, including Poland,<ref name="Kotowski et al. 2019"/> Portugal,<ref name="Reis et al. 2016"/> Macedonia,<ref name="Karadelev et al. 2007"/> and Montenegro.<ref name="Kasom & Karadelev 2012"/>
