'''''Cortinarius anomalus''''', also known as the '''variable webcap''', is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus of the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''. It produces a medium-sized [[mushroom]] with a grayish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide, gray-violet [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and a whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] with pale yellow belts below.

The mushroom grows solitarily or in scattered groups on the ground in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous forest]]s. It is found throughout the [[temperate]] zone of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described as ''Agaricus anomalus'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1818.<ref name="Fries 1818"/> Fries later transferred it to the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'' in 1838 in his ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici''.<ref name="Fries 1838"/> [[Friedrich Otto Wünsche]] placed it in ''[[Dermocybe]]'' as ''Dermocybe anomala''.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Dermocybe anomala"/>

[[Phylogenetic]] analysis suggests that ''Cortinarius anomalus'' is closely related to ''[[Cortinarius collinitus]]'', [[Cortinarius odorifer|''C.&nbsp;odorifer'']], and [[Cortinarius violaceus|''C.&nbsp;violaceus'']].<ref name="Peintner 2001"/>

The fungus is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "variable webcap".<ref name="English Common Names"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''anomalus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word for "paradoxical".<ref name="Evenson 1997"/>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is up to {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide, initially almost spherical, then expanded convex and finally flattened. The cap has a broad, blunt and low [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], which frequently lies in a depression since the margin which is initially rolled inward, then straight, often becomes turned upward. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is dry and difficult to peel. The cap surface is dry or humid, non-shiny in the center, but shiny towards the margin which is covered with fibrils when young. The cap is almost uniformly colored dirty rusty-brown or ashy-brown to grayish-tan, sometimes slightly paler towards the margin, with or without a faint grayish-violet tinge when young.<ref name="Pilat 1961"/>

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are moderately crowded, about {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} wide when mature, thin, and whitish-blue, grayish-blue or pale [[lilac (color)|lilac]] when young. As the mushroom matures, the gill color rapidly fades and soon becomes brown, then a rusty-clay color, without any trace of the blue characteristic of young specimens. The gill attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is adnate (fused to the stem) and emarginate (notched). The edge of the gills is pale, and the edge ranges from finely denticulate (with a very finely toothed margin) to straight.<ref name="Pilat 1961"/>

The stem is {{convert|6–8|cm|abbr=on|frac=16}} long and {{convert|0.5–0.8|cm|abbr=on|frac=16}} thick, cylindrical above, slightly club-shaped below, and usually somewhat curved. It is initially very fibrillose, later silvery shiny and wavy, violet or grayish violet at the apex when young, more gray or grayish-brown at the base. The violet coloring soon disappears and then the stem is whitish or pale clay brownish and silkily fibrillose. Beneath the cap there is a golden yellow ring-like region. On the rest of the stem there are sometimes remnants of the [[partial veil]] as yellowish-saffron hairy tufts, which form incomplete rings or scattered minute scales. The cortina (a cobweb-like partial veil consisting of silky fibrils) is thick, whitish, and lasts only a short time.<ref name="Pilat 1961"/>

The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] in the cap is thin, rarely thicker than {{convert|0.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=16}}, whitish to pale violet or pale lilac in the upper part of the stem when young, but soon fading, grayish-white in the lower part of the stem. Its smell is faintly fruity, and its taste mild.<ref name="Pilat 1961"/> It is considered inedible.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=174}}</ref>

The [[spore deposit]] is rusty-brown. The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are spherical to egg-shaped, with a distinct apiculus (the part of a spore which attaches to the [[sterigmata]] at the end of a basidium), finely verrucose, 5.7–9 by 7–8.5&nbsp;[[μm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 30–40 by 8–9&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Pilat 1961"/>
