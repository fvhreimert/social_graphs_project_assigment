'''''Hericium abietis''''',<ref>''Abietis'', "of ''[[Abies]]''", the fir genus.</ref> commonly known as the '''conifer coral hericium''',<ref name="Arora 1986"/> '''bear's head''', or '''western coral hedgehog''', is a species of [[tooth fungus]]. It produces a cream white [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] up to {{convert|10–75|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall and wide.

The mushroom grows on [[conifer]] stumps or logs in North America, fruiting from after the start of the fall rains to mid-season. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described as ''Hydnum abietis'' by American botanist [[James Robert Weir]] in 1931. Weir collected the [[type (biology)|type]] specimens in 1916, near the [[Priest River (Idaho)|Priest River]] in [[Idaho]]. [[Kenneth Archibald Harrison]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Hericium]]'' in 1964.<ref name="Harrison 1964"/> The mushroom is commonly known as the "bear's head"<ref name="Tylutki II 1987"/> or the "western coral hedgehog".<ref name="McKnight 1987"/>

==Description==


The fruit body comprises a compact, branched mass originating from a thick, tough base with long spines hanging down. Its color ranges from white to creamy, light yellowish, to [[salmon (color)|salmon]]-[[buff (color)|buff]].<ref name="Arora 1986" /> The hanging spines are usually {{convert|0.5–1|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} long, although some may be as long as {{convert|2.5|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}}; they are soft and brittle and typically grow as clusters at the tips of the branches.<ref name="Arora 1986" /> The fruit bodies are typically {{convert|10 to 75|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide and tall, but can attain massive sizes; one noted specimen was about {{convert|100|lb|kg}}.<ref name="Arora 1986"/>

''Hericium abietis'' produces a white [[spore print]]. The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are spherical or nearly so, smooth to slightly roughened, [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 4.5–5.5 by 4–5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Arora 1986"/> The [[hypha]]e are monomitic (consisting of only generative hyphae), and they have [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name="Tylutki II 1987"/>

===Similar species===
''[[Hericium erinaceus]]'' is a lookalike spine fungus. It can be distinguished by its more compact fruit body structure that lacks multiple branches, in which the hanging spines all originate from a single thick [[tubercle]].<ref name="Tylutki II 1987"/> In ''[[Hericium coralloides]]'', the spines line the undersides of the branches, unlike ''H.&nbsp;abietis'', whose spines are arranged in clusters at the tip of branches.<ref name="Bessette 1987"/>

===Uses===
''Hericium abietis'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]]<ref>{{cite book |last=Meuninck |first=Jim |title=Foraging Mushrooms Oregon: Finding, Identifying, and Preparing Edible Wild Mushrooms |date=2017 |publisher=[[Falcon Guides]] |isbn=978-1-4930-2669-2 |page=60}}</ref> and choice. [[David Arora]] suggests that cooking the mushroom produces a flavor similar to fish and that it is suitable for [[saute]]ing, [[marinating]], or preparing as a [[curry (dish)|curry]] dish.<ref name="Arora 1986"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Hericium abietis'' causes a [[white rot]] of [[conifer]]s; this is a form of [[wood decay]] featuring a selective attack on [[lignin]] and [[hemicellulose]] in wood.<ref name="Tylutki II 1987"/> The fruit bodies grow singly or occasionally in small groups on the dead wood of conifers, especially [[Douglas-fir]].<ref name="Arora 1986"/> It can also be cultivated on conifer sawdust or logs.<ref name="Xiao 1997"/> The species is found throughout North America.<ref name="Bessette 1987"/>
