'''''Pleurotus cornucopiae''''' is a species of edible fungus in the genus ''[[Pleurotus]]'', It is quite similar to the better-known ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]'', and like that species is cultivated and sold in markets in Europe and China, but it is distinguished because its gills are very decurrent, forming a network on the stem.

==Naming==
The species name means "of the [[Cornucopia]]" (horn of plenty), which is appropriate since the mushrooms are edible and sometimes take on a shape similar to a [[drinking horn]].

The original definition of this species, or [[basionym]], was made by [[Jean-Jacques Paulet]] in 1793 as ''Dendrosarcos cornucopiae''.  At a time when most [[Agaric|gilled mushrooms]] were lumped into genus ''[[Agaricus]]'', Paulet invented genus ''Dendrosarcos'', later Latinised to ''Dendrosarcus'', for those having an excentric or missing stipe.  In fact those fungi have not been found to be a closely related group, and today the name only has historical interest, though the taxonomic rules imply that it still needs to be recorded.<ref name=SF1/><ref name=SF2/><ref name=Paulet/>  In 1871 in his "Führer in die Pilzkunde" ("Guide to Mycology"), [[Paul Kummer]] introduced ''Pleurotus'' as a genus,<ref name=Kummer/> but the allocation of ''P. cornucopiae'' to it was only done later in 1910 by [[Léon Louis Rolland]].<ref name=SF2/>

The synonym ''Pleurotus sapidus'' due to Schulzer (1873) is sometimes seen

The English name "Branched Oyster Mushroom" has been given to this species.<ref name=FirstNature/>

==Description==
The following sections use the given references throughout.<ref name=Bon/><ref name=Courtecuisse/><ref name=FN/><ref name=Moser/>

===General===
*The cap grows to about {{Convert|15|cm|frac=4}} wide, whitish when young then darkening to brownish with age.<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |pages=128}}</ref> At most there may be very slight traces of the veil.
*The stem is always present, may be forked and can vary from excentric to fairly central.  Each stem may be up to about 12&nbsp;cm long and up to 2&nbsp;cm thick.
*The whitish [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[decurrent]] down the stem and [[Anastomosis|anastomose]] (criss-cross), becoming a network of ridges at the bottom.  
*The flesh is firm and white.<ref name="tfb" /> The strong smell has an [[aniseed]] element and is also floury when the mushroom is cut.  The taste is floury.<ref name=Eyssartier/><ref name=Moser/><ref name=FN/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
*The flesh may be [[Hypha#Classification based on cell wall and overall form|monomitic]] (as with ordinary fragile mushrooms) or [[Hypha#Classification based on cell wall and overall form|dimitic]], having extra thick-walled hyphae which give the flesh a tougher consistency, especially when older.<ref name=FN/>
*The spores in the form of an rather elongated ellipsoid are around 8-12&nbsp;μm by 3.5-5.5&nbsp;μm.
*There are no [[Cystidium|cystidia]].

=== Similar species ===
'' in a German market]]
''Pleurotus cornucopiae'' is quite similar to the well-known food mushroom ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus]]'', being distinguished because in the latter case, the gills are not very [[decurrent]] and the cap colour is slate or bluish grey. Another species, [[Pleurotus pulmonarius|''P.&nbsp;pulmonarius'']] has a comparable cap colour to ''P.&nbsp;cornucopiae'' but the gills on the stipe are similar to ''P.&nbsp;ostreatus''.

It is even more closely related to the yellow-capped "golden oyster mushroom", ''[[Pleurotus citrinopileatus]]'', which is native to eastern Asia.  The forms are easily distinguishable by the cap colour, but they are sometimes considered to be just varieties of the same species, and as a consequence golden oyster mushrooms are sometimes identified using the older scientific name ''Pleurotus cornucopiae''.<ref name="Royse" />  However, according to the mycological reference "Species Fungorum", these are two separate species.<ref name="SF3" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
This mushroom is [[saprobic]] on dead wood and can also be a weak [[parasite]].<ref name="FN" /> It occurs stumps and fallen trunks of oak, beech, elm, and other broad-leaved trees.

Appearing from spring to late summer, it is distributed in the wild throughout Europe (from August to November),<ref name="tfb" /> where it varies locally between common and fairly rare.<ref name="Courtecuisse" />  It is also reported from the U.S. and Mexico.<ref name="GBIF" />

==Ecology==
It is a mild parasite of broad-leaved trees.<ref name="FN" />

==Uses==
This mushroom is edible and it is cultivated in a manner similar to ''[[Pleurotus ostreatus|P.&nbsp;ostreatus]]'', though less extensively.<ref name="Mushroomers" /> Specimens are best collected young and with the tougher stems dicarded.<ref name="tfb" />

A Chinese paper evaluated several commercially available varieties of ''P.&nbsp;cornucopiae'' and reported that it in the Shanghai area an appropriate growth medium is cotton-seed hulls and wood-chips, with 65% water content.<ref name="Shi" />  Another paper (actually treating the yellow-topped form) also suggested pasteurized switch grass as a useful substrate, though the yield was less than with cotton-seed hulls and straw.<ref name="Royse" />
