'''''Panaeolus tropicalis''''' is a species of [[psilocybin]] producing [[mushroom]] in the family [[Bolbitiaceae]]. It is also known as ''Copelandia tropicalis''.

== Description ==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is 1.5 — 2(2.5) cm and hemispheric to convex to [[wikt:companulate|companulate]]. The margin is incurved when young, clay-colored, often reddish brown towards the disc, [[hygrophanous]], smooth, and grayish to greenish; it is translucent-striate at the margin when wet. It becomes blue when bruised.<br />
The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]], distinctly mottled, and dully grayish with blackish spots.<br />
The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 5–12&nbsp;cm long, 2–3&nbsp;mm thick, hollow, and vertically striate. It is blackish towards the base, greyish towards the apex, and pallid to whitish fibrils run the length of the stipe. The stipe is equal to slightly swollen at the base and lacks a partial [[veil (botany)|veil]].<br />
''Panaeolus tropicalis'' [[spores]] are dark violet to jet black, [[ellipsoid]], and 10.5–12.0 x 7–9 [[μm]]. The [[basidium|basidia]] each produce two spores.

Like many other hallucinogenic mushrooms, this fungus readily bruises blue where it is handled. It can be differentiated from ''[[Panaeolus cyanescens]]'' by microscopic characteristics.

== Distribution and habitat ==

''Panaeolus tropicalis'' is a mushroom that grows on dung. It is most often found in [[Hawaii]], [[Central Africa]], and [[Cambodia]]; it can also be found in [[Mexico]], [[Tanzania]], the [[Philippines]], [[Florida]], and [[Japan]].
