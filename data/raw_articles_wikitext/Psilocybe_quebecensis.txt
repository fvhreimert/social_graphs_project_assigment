'''''Psilocybe quebecensis''''' is a moderately active [[hallucinogen]]ic [[mushroom]] in the section Aztecorum, having [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as main active compounds. Native to [[Quebec]], it is the most northern known [[psilocybin]] mushroom after ''Psilocybe semilanceata'' in northern Scandinavia.<ref>{{Cite journal

Macroscopically this mushroom somewhat resembles ''[[Psilocybe baeocystis]]''.

==Etymology==
Named for the province [[Quebec]], where it was discovered.

== Description ==
*'''Cap''': {{convert|1|-|3|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} ({{convert|3.5|cm|in|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) in diameter. Nearly [[hemispheric]] to [[wikt:convex|convex]] at first, becoming [[subcampanulate]] to more or less plane when mature, viscid and even to translucent-striate when moist, [[hygrophanous]],   brownish to straw colored, yellowish to milk white when dry. Surface smooth, may become finely wrinkled with age,  flesh whitish. Readily stains blue-green where injured.
*'''Gills''': Adnate, thin, moderately broad to swollen in the middle. Grayish yellow with green tones becoming dark brown at maturity,  with the edges remaining whitish.
*'''Spore Print''': Dark purplish brown.
*'''[[Stipe (mycology)|Stipe]]''': {{convert|2|-|3.5|cm|in|2|abbr=on}} ({{convert|4.5|cm|in|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}) long by {{convert|1|-|2|mm|in|3|abbr=on}} ({{convert|2.5|mm|in|3|abbr=on|disp=or}}) thick. Equal, slightly subbulbous, smooth to striate, brittle, tough, and fibrous, base is furnished with long conspicuous [[rhizomorphs]]. Yellowish or brownish towards the base, whitish when dry, partial veil cortinate, and soon disappearing,  no [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]] present, readily bruises blue.
*'''Taste''': Somewhat farinaceous
*'''Odor''': Farinaceous
*'''Microscopic features''': Spores [[ellipsoid]] to [[subovoid]] in side and face view some spores mango shaped, 8.8–11&nbsp;μm (16&nbsp;μm) × 6.6–7.7&nbsp;μm (8.8&nbsp;μm). [[Basidia]] 15–20&nbsp;μm  (28&nbsp;μm) 4-spored. [[Pleurocystidia]] present, 12–25&nbsp;μm (35&nbsp;μm) × (3&nbsp;μm) 5–10&nbsp;μm (15&nbsp;μm), relatively polymorphic, often fusiform-ventricose or ampullaceous. [[Cheilocystidia]] (18&nbsp;μm) 22–36&nbsp;μm × 5.5–8.8&nbsp;μm (10&nbsp;μm), fusoid-ampullaceous with an extended neck, 2–3.3&nbsp;μm thick, abundant, forming a sterile band, sometimes with a hyaline viscous drop at the apex.

==Habitat and formation==
Solitary to gregarious, rarely cespitose, on rotting wood, particularly in the outwashes of streams in the decayed-wood substratum of alder, birch, fir and spruce in the late summer and fall. Reported from [[Quebec, Canada]] specifically in the [[Jacques-Cartier River]] Valley, fruiting at a temperature of {{convert|6|to|15|°C|°F}} from summer to late October. Recently found in the United States ([[Michigan]]). Originally discovered in 1966, P.Quebecensis has also been confirmed growing in at least one area within Cape Breton, Nova Scotia.
