'''''Tylopilus alboater''''', also known as the '''black velvet bolete''', is a [[bolete]] fungus in the family [[Boletaceae]].

The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have a black to grayish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that measures up to {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter. The caps of young specimens have a velvety texture and are covered with a whitish to gray powdery coating; this texture and coating is gradually lost as the mushroom matures, and the cap often develops cracks. The pores on the underside of the cap are small and pinkish. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is bluish purple to black, and measures up to {{convert|10|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long by {{convert|4|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick. Both the pore surface and the whitish cap [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] will stain pink to reddish gray, and eventually turn black after being cut or injured.

The species is found in North America east of the [[Rocky Mountains]], and in eastern Asia, including China, Japan, Taiwan, and Thailand. A [[mycorrhiza]]l species, it grows solitarily, scattered, or in groups on the ground usually under [[deciduous tree]]s, particularly oak, although it has been recorded from [[deciduous forest|deciduous]], [[coniferous forest|coniferous]], and [[mixed forest]]s. The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], and generally considered one of the best edible ''Tylopilus'' species.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The species was first [[species description|described]] in 1822 as ''Boletus alboater'' by [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]] from specimens he collected in [[North Carolina]].<ref name=Schweinitz1822/> [[Elias Magnus Fries]] [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] this name in his 1821 ''Systema Mycologicum''.<ref name=Fries1821/> The species was one of several ''Boletus'' species that [[Otto Kuntze]] transferred to ''[[Suillus]]'' in his 1898 ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]''.<ref name=Kuntze1898/> American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Tylopilus]]'' in 1909.<ref name=Murrill1909/> In 1931, French mycologist [[Jean-Edouard Gilbert]] transferred the species to his newly created genus ''Porphyrellus'',<ref name=Gilbert1931/> but this name has since been [[wikt:subsume|subsumed]] into ''Tylopilus''.<ref name=Kirk2008/>

In 1875, [[Charles Horton Peck]] described ''Boletus nigrellus'' from specimens he collected in [[Sand Lake, New York]].<ref name=Peck1875/> Murrill reduced this name to [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] with ''T.&nbsp;alboater'' in 1916, and noted that Peck's description was made from young material obtained "before the white tubes had been colored by mature spores".<ref name=Murrill1916/> Several later authorities have treated Peck's species as a synonym of ''Tylopilus alboater'';<ref name=Murrill1920/><ref name=Singer1947/><ref name=Wolfe1981/> this synonymy, however, is not indicated by either of the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] authorities [[Index Fungorum]] or [[MycoBank]].<ref name="urlIndexFungorum synonymy: Boletus nigrellus"/><ref name="urlMycoBank: Boletus nigrellus"/>

The [[specific epithet]] ''alboater'' means "white and black".<ref name=Roody2003/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "black velvet bolete";<ref name=Bessett2000>Bessette ''et al''. (2000), pp.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=geiwy6Jf_ZcC&pg=PA256 256–7].</ref> Murrill called it the "blackish bolete".<ref name=Murrill1920/>

The shape of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially convex before later becoming broadly convex to eventually flattened in maturity; the diameter of the cap is typically between {{convert|3|and|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}. The cap surface is dry, with a velvet-like texture, although in age it can become ''rimose'' (developing a network of cracks and small crevices). The cap color is initially black to dark grayish brown; young specimens can have a whitish bloom (resembling a dusting of fine powder) on the surface.<ref name=Bessett2000/> Fruit bodies, especially young specimens, tend to be free of [[maggot]]s and other insect larvae.<ref name=Kuo2007/> As the mushroom matures, the bloom disappears and the color fades to become grayish to grayish brown.<ref name=Kuo2007/> The cap [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, but after it is cut or injured, it will stain pink to reddish gray, and eventually turn black.<ref name=Bessett2000/>

[[Spore]]s are produced in [[basidia]] that are arranged in a vertically arranged layer of minute tubes on the underside of the cap that create a surface of pores. This surface is whitish when young before turning dull pink or flesh-colored in maturity. When bruised, the pore surface initially stains reddish and slowly turns black. The shape of the pores is angular to irregular, and they are small, with roughly two pores per millimeter. The tubes are {{convert|5|–|10|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} deep, and usually sunken around the area of attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].<ref name=Phillips2005/> The stem is {{convert|4|–|10|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long by {{convert|2|–|4|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick, and is equal in width throughout its length, slightly thicker towards the base,<ref name=Bessett2000/> or somewhat thicker in the middle. It is the same color as the cap, or paler.<ref name=Roody2003/> The surface texture of the stem is usually smooth, although some specimens may be slightly reticulated near the top. The [[spore print]] can range from pinkish to a deep flesh color.<ref name=Bessett2000/>

The spores are oval to ellipsoid in shape, smooth, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and measure 7–11 by 3.5–5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name=Bessett2000/> The basidia are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 15–24 by 6–7.5&nbsp;μm. Pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the tube faces) are irregularly club-shaped, with dimensions of 20–36 by 7–10&nbsp;μm, while cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are club-shaped, rare, occur singly, and measure 18–32 by 7–9&nbsp;μm. Although rare, there are also caulocystidia (occurring on the stem) that are arranged in groups, and which measure individually 24–30 by 6–9&nbsp;μm. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent from the [[hypha]]e of ''T.&nbsp;alboater''.<ref name=Zhishu1993/>

''Tylopilus alboater'' is an [[edible mushroom]] with a pleasant odor and a mild taste.<ref name=Phillips2005/> It is considered one of the best of the edible ''Tylopilus''—a genus that is usually associated with bitter-tasting, unpalatable species.<ref name=Bessett2000/> Frying slices of the mushroom brings out a "delicate, earthy, nutty flavor"; longer frying times make the cap "pleasantly crisp".<ref name=Kuo2007/> The mushrooms can be used in [[mushroom dye|mushroom dying]].<ref name=Bessette2001/>

Some ''Tylopilus'' species have a superficial resemblance to ''T.&nbsp;alboater'' and might be confused with it, including ''[[Tylopilus atronicotianus|T.&nbsp;atronicotianus]]'', ''[[Tylopilus atratus|T.&nbsp;atratus]]'', and ''[[Tylopilus griseocarneus|T.&nbsp;griseocarneus]]''.<ref name=Bessett2000/> ''T.&nbsp;atratus'' produces smaller fruit bodies with caps up to {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and its whitish flesh directly stains black without any intermediate reddish phase when injured. It is known from only from western [[New York state]].<ref>Bessette ''et al.'' (2000), p. 259.</ref> The "false black velvet bolete", ''T.&nbsp;atronicotianus'', has a brownish cap that lacks the velvety texture of ''T.&nbsp;alboater'', and has stems that are minutely velvety and almost black near the base.<ref name=Roody2003/> ''T.&nbsp;griseocarneus'', found in the [[Atlantic coastal plain|Atlantic]] and [[Gulf Coastal Plain]]s of North America, is readily distinguished from ''T.&nbsp;alboater'' by the strong orange to red discoloration that results when cutting or damaging the flesh of a fresh specimen. Furthermore, ''T.&nbsp;griseocarneus'' lacks the whitish bloom present on young caps of ''T.&nbsp;alboater'', and typically has a more prominently reticulated stem.<ref name=Wolfe1989/> Specimens of ''T.&nbsp;alboater'' that are paler than usual can be confused with ''T.&nbsp;ferrugineus'', but the latter has yellow cystidia when mounted in KOH, while the cystidia of the former are brownish yellow under similar conditions.<ref name=Chen2002/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Tylopilus alboater'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species, and its fruit bodies grow on the ground solitarily, scattered, or in groups under deciduous trees, particularly [[oak]]. Fruiting occurs in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]], [[coniferous forest|coniferous]], and [[mixed forest]]s.<ref name=Roody2003/><ref name=Chen2002/> Its dark color makes it difficult to notice in the field.<ref name=Roody2003/>
