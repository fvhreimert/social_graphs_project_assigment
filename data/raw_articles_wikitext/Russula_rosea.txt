'''''Russula rosea''''' ([[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] ''Russula lepida''), known as the '''rosy russula''', is a north temperate, commonly found mushroom of the large "brittlegill" genus ''[[Russula]]''.

The cap is convex when young, later flat, mostly bright cinnabar to carmine red; often with yellow spots and up to 10&nbsp;cm in diameter. The gills are pale straw-yellow, brittle, and occasionally with a red edge at the rim of the cap. The spores are pale-cream. The stem is usually flushed carmine, but can be pure white. The flesh is hard and bitter-tasting; some consider it edible, others inedible.<ref>[https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/russula-rosea.php Russula rosea Pers. - Rosy Brittlegill]</ref>

This mushroom is commonly found in [[coniferous]] forests{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} or near [[beech]] trees.

==Similar species==
The rare ''[[Russula pseudointegra]]'' is distinguished by its hot-tasting flesh. Red-stemmed forms of ''R. rosea'' could also be confused with ''[[Russula xerampelina]]'', but the latter has softer flesh and no woody flavour.
