'''''Cortinarius violaceus''''', [[common name|commonly known]] as the '''violet webcap''' or '''violet cort''', is a [[fungus]] in the webcap genus, ''[[Cortinarius]]'', for which it serves as the [[type species]]. It was first [[species description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753 and has undergone several name changes. It is readily distinguished from other species in the genus by its dark colouration and distinct [[cystidia]]. There are some populations that seem to prefer [[deciduous]] trees and others that prefer [[pine]]s, but no [[genetic divergence]] between the two has been found. When identified as [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] separate from the deciduous-preferring populations, the pine-preferring populations have been referred to either as a separate species, ''C.&nbsp;hercynicus'', or as a [[subspecies]], ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' ssp. ''hercynicus''. Other populations once identified as ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' or close to that species have now been described as new and separate species, such as ''[[Cortinarius palatinus|C.&nbsp;palatinus]]'', ''[[Cortinarius neotropicus|C.&nbsp;neotropicus]]'', ''[[Cortinarius altissimus|C.&nbsp;altissimus]]'', [[Cortinarius kioloensis|''C.&nbsp;kioloensis'']] and ''[[Cortinarius hallowellensis|C.&nbsp;hallowellensis]]''.

The [[fruit bodies]] are dark purple mushrooms with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} across, sporting [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] underneath. The [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] measures {{convert|6 to 12|cm|frac=3}} by {{convert|1 to 2|cm|frac=8|abbr=on}}, sometimes with a thicker base. The dark [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has a smell reminiscent of [[cedar wood]]. Forming [[symbiotic]] ([[ectomycorrhiza]]l) relationships with the roots of various plant species, ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' is found predominantly in [[conifer]] forests in North America and [[deciduous forest]]s in Europe. It is sometimes described as [[edible mushroom|edible]], but resembles some toxic species.

==Taxonomy==
''Agaricus violaceus'' was one of the few fungal species named by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1753 work ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.<ref>{{cite book| author=Linnaeus C| authorlink=Carl Linnaeus| title=Species Plantarum| publisher=Laurentii Salvii| location=Stockholm, Sweden| year=1753| chapter=Tomus&nbsp;II| url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/359194| page=1173| language=la| access-date=2018-02-21| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171015162934/https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/359194| archive-date=2017-10-15| url-status=live}}</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''violaceus'' refers to the deep violet colour of its cap.<ref name=Weber/> In English, it is [[common name|commonly known]] as the violet webcap,<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> or violet cort.<ref name="Bessette 1997"/> French naturalist [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] viewed it as a [[variety (taxonomy)|variety]] (''violaceus'') of a variable species he described as ''Amanita araneosa'' in 1783,<ref name=lamarck1783/> and [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] placed it in the [[Section (botany)|Section]] ''Cortinaria'' of ''Agaricus'' in his 1801 work ''Synopsis Methodica Fungorum''.<ref name=Persoon1801/> ''Cortinarius'' was established as a genus by English botanist [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] in the first volume of his 1821 work ''A Natural Arrangement of British Plants'', where the species was recorded as ''Cortinaria violacea'', "the violet curtain-stool".<ref name="Gray 1821"/>

The starting date of fungal [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] had been set as 1&nbsp;January 1821, to coincide with the date of the works of the "father of mycology", the Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]], which meant the name ''Cortinarius violaceus'' required [[sanctioned name|sanction]] by Fries (indicated in the name by a colon) to be considered valid. Thus, the species was written as ''Cortinarius violaceus'' (L.: Fr.) Gray. However, a 1987 revision of the ''[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]'' set the starting date at 1&nbsp;May 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's ''Species Plantarum''.<ref name=Esser1994/> Hence, the name no longer requires the ratification of Fries's authority, and is thus written as ''Cortinarius violaceus'' (L.) Gray.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Cortinarius violaceus"/>

German botanist [[Friedrich Otto Wünsche]] described the species as ''Inoloma violaceum'' in 1877. In 1891, his countryman [[Otto Kuntze]] published ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]'', his response to what he perceived as poor methodology in existing nomenclatural practice.<ref name="Kuntze"/> He called the violet webcap ''Gomphos violaceus'' in 1898.<ref name="Kuntze 1898"/> However, Kuntze's revisionary programme was not accepted by the majority of biologists.<ref name="Kuntze"/>

''Cortinarius violaceus'' was designated as the [[type species]] for the genus ''Cortinarius'' by [[Frederic Clements]] and [[Cornelius Lott Shear]] in their 1931 work ''The Genera of Fungi''.<ref name=clements1931/> Mycologist [[David Arora]] considers this odd, due to the mushroom's unusual colour and [[cystidia]]. Because of this designation, if ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' were to be split from the rest of the current genus, then, according to the rules of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, it would retain the name ''Cortinarius'', while the other species would have to be reclassified.<ref name=Arora/> The species was one of only two placed in the ''Cortinarius'' subgenus ''Cortinarius'' by the Austrian mycologist [[Meinhard Michael Moser|Meinhard Moser]].<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> [[molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] investigation of webcaps worldwide has increased this number to at least twelve.<ref name="Harrower E 2015"/>

A 2015 genetic study by evolutionary biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' and its closest relatives suggests that the group (section ''Cortinarius'') originated in Australasia and began [[Genetic divergence|diverging]] from a common ancestor around twelve million years ago in the [[Miocene]], with ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' itself diverging from its closest relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates that some form of dispersal must have taken place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants ([[angiosperm]]s), and ''C.&nbsp;violaceus''—or its direct ancestor—developed a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.<ref name="Harrower E 2015older"/>

Some mycologists classify ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' as two distinct species—''Cortinarius violaceus'' and ''Cortinarius hercynicus'', with ''hercynicus'' relating to the [[Hercynian Forest]] region of southern Germany. These species are differentiated [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] by the latter population's rounder [[basidiospore|spores]].<ref name=Arora/> Persoon had described ''C.&nbsp;hercynicus'' as a separate species in 1794, though Fries regarded it as conspecific with ''C.&nbsp;violaceus''.<ref name="Fries 1838"/> Moser separated them once again as species in 1967, and Norwegian biologist Tor Erik Brandrud classified ''C.&nbsp;hercynicus'' as a [[subspecies]] of ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' in 1983.<ref name=brandrud1983/> However, Harrower and colleagues, on limited molecular testing, found no genetic or ecological difference between the two [[taxa]].<ref name="Harrower E 2015"/>

Some fungal populations around the world that have been classified as ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' have been found to belong to separate [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]] and hence reclassified as new species within section ''Cortinarius''.<ref name="Harrower E 2015older"/> Two separate lineages discovered in populations from Costa Rica have been renamed ''[[Cortinarius palatinus]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius neotropicus|C.&nbsp;neotropicus]]'',<ref name=nybg/> one from Guyana—described as [[sp.&nbsp;aff.]] ''violaceus''—has become ''[[Cortinarius altissimus|C.&nbsp;altissimus]]'', and another from Western Australia and [[Tasmania]] described as both ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' and sp. aff. ''violaceus'' has become ''[[Cortinarius hallowellensis|C.&nbsp;hallowellensis]]''. Yet another from Eastern Australia has been named ''[[Cortinarius kioloensis|C. kioloensis]]''.<ref name="Harrower E 2015"/> The poorly known species ''[[Cortinarius subcalyptrosporus]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius atroviolaceus]]'' from [[Borneo]] are almost indistinguishable from ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' outside of hard-to-observe spore detail—the former has smaller spores with a detached perisporium (outer layer) and the latter has smaller spores and fruiting bodies.<ref name=moser86/> Another population, known from Borneo, [[New Guinea]] and New Zealand, was ascribed to ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' by Moser. It was noted as very similar to the original species concept of ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'',<ref name=moser86/> and awaits description as a new species after a phylogenetic study revealed it to represent a distinct taxon.<ref name="Harrower E 2015older"/>

''Cortinarius violaceus'' has a convex (becoming broadly convex, [[Umbo (mycology)|umbonate]] or flat)<ref name=Arora/> [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of 3.5–15&nbsp;centimetres ({{frac|1|3|8}}–6&nbsp;in) in diameter with an incurved margin. It is dark violet to blue-black in colour, and is covered in fine, downy scales.<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> This layer on the cap is known as the [[pileipellis]], which is either classified as a trichoderm—parallel [[hypha]]e running perpendicular to the surface and forming a layer 6–22&nbsp;[[μm]] wide—or rarely an ixocutis, a layer of gelatinized hyphae 2–11&nbsp;μm wide.<ref name="Harrower E 2015"/> The cap surface, unlike that of many other ''Cortinarius'' species, is neither sticky nor slimy, though it is occasionally greasy.<ref name="Harrower E 2015"/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], or stalk, is {{convert|6 to 18|cm|frac=3|abbr=on}} tall, and {{convert|1 to 2|cm|frac=8|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The stipe is a similar colour to the cap, and covered in [[wool]]-like [[fibril]]s;<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> purple [[mycelium]] can be present at the base.<ref name="Courtecuisse"/> Younger specimens feature a [[Partial veil|veil]], but this vanishes quickly.<ref name=Arora/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is violet, but darker below the pileipellis and in the stipe.<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> The flesh has a mild taste, indistinctly reminiscent of [[cedar wood]], with a slight, pleasant smell, also reminiscent of cedar wood.<ref name="Phillips 2006"/><ref name="Buczacki 2012"/> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are dark violet, changing to a purplish-brown with age.<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> They have an [[Lamella (mycology)#Classification|adnate]] connection to the stipe, and can be very dark in older specimens.<ref name="Courtecuisse"/> The mushroom stains red when in contact with [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH).<ref name="Harrower E 2015"/> Fruit bodies identified as ''C.&nbsp;v. hercynicus'' are less robust than those of the nominate subspecies.<ref name="Courtecuisse"/>

The [[spore print]] is rust-coloured, while the spores themselves measure 12&nbsp;to 15&nbsp;μm by 7&nbsp;to 8.5&nbsp;μm. They are rough, from elliptical to almond-shaped,<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> and covered in medium-sized warts.<ref name="Courtecuisse"/> The spores are wider in ''C.&nbsp;v. hercynicus''.<ref name="Courtecuisse"/> The species is the only one in the genus to have cystidia on both the faces and the edges of the gills.<ref name=Arora/> A large number of cystidia are present, and, individually, they measure between 60 and 100&nbsp;μm by between 12&nbsp;and 25&nbsp;μm. They are flask-shaped, with somewhat purple contents.<ref name="Courtecuisse"/>

=== Similar species ===
Although there are many ''Cortinarius'' species with some degree of violet colour, ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' and its close relatives are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour.<ref name="Weber" /> ''[[Cortinarius iodes]]'' of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe.<ref name="Bessette 2007" /> The other species in the section ''Cortinarius'' are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as ''C.&nbsp;violaceus''.<ref name="Harrower E 2015" /> Certain ''[[Leptonia]]'' species in northwestern North America, including ''[[Leptonia carnea|L. carnea]]'' and ''[[Leptonia nigroviolacea|L.&nbsp;nigroviolacea]]'', have a similar color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.<ref name="Arora" />

''C. cotoneus'', ''[[Entoloma bloxamii]]'', and ''E. parvum'' are also similar.<ref name=":0" />

==Distribution and habitat==

''Cortinarius violaceus'' is found across North America, Europe and Asia.<ref name="Harrower E 2015"/> Although widespread, it is not common anywhere in Europe,<ref name=brandrud1983/> and it is listed as endangered in the British Isles.<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> ''Cortinarius violaceus'' is a rare component of [[Subarctic climate|subarctic]] areas of western Greenland.<ref name=Elborne1990/> It has not been recorded from Iceland.<ref name=brandrud1983/>

In Europe, it grows in [[deciduous]] woodland during autumn, especially among [[oak]], [[birch]] and [[beech]], but is also found on occasion with [[conifer]]s.<ref name="Phillips 2006"/> It is also occasionally known from treeless [[heathland]], where it is associated with [[bracken]].<ref name="Buczacki 2012"/> The species favours [[soil acidity|acidic soil]].<ref name="Buczacki 2012"/> ''Cortinarius violaceus'' forms [[Ectomycorrhiza|mycorrhizal]] associations with several species of tree.<ref name=brandrud1983/> In this symbiotic relationship, the fungus gains carbon from the plant and supplies it with beneficial minerals.<ref name=harrison95/> In Nordic countries, its hosts include white birch (''[[Betula pubescens]]''), silver birch (''[[Betula pendula|B. pendula]]''), European aspen (''[[Populus tremula]]'') and rarely European beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]''). No records of association with oak (''[[Quercus]]'') are known from this region. Brandrud reported that what he described as spp. ''hercynicus'' grew with ''[[Picea abies]]'', generally in more alkaline soils and along with mosses of the genera ''[[Hylocomium]]'' and ''[[Pleurozium]]'', and, in moister areas, big shaggy-moss (''[[Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus]]''), as well as the [[Ranunculaceae|buttercup-family]] shrub ''[[Hepatica nobilis]]''.<ref name=brandrud1983/> The species grows with ''Betula pubescens'' in Greenland,<ref name=Elborne1990/> and is also associated with hazelnut (''[[Corylus avellana]]'') in Central and Southern Europe.<ref name=trappe62/>

In North America, ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' favours conifers, and, though rare over much of the continent, is relatively common in certain areas, including [[Mount Rainier National Park]] and [[Olympic National Park]].<ref name=Arora/> It is more common in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the [[Great Lakes]] region.<ref name=Weber/> Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood,<ref name=Arora/> and can grow in [[fairy ring]]s.<ref name="Eppinger 2006"/> Closely related species that look like ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.<ref name="Harrower E 2015"/>

==Edibility and biochemistry==
''Cortinarius violaceus'' are sometimes considered inedible,<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil |url-access=registration |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil/page/173 173]}}</ref> and sometimes considered edible, but not choice.<ref name=Arora/> Instead, the primary appeal of the species to [[mushroom hunters]], according to Arora, is its beauty.<ref name=Arora/> Its similarity to some other (inedible or toxic) webcaps renders it risky to eat.<ref name="Phillips 2006"/><ref name="Courtecuisse"/> The taste after cooking is reportedly bitter.<ref name=Weber/>

The colour of ''C.&nbsp;violaceus'' cannot be converted to a [[dye]], unlike that of some other ''Cortinarius'' species, such as ''[[Cortinarius sanguineus|C.&nbsp;sanguineus]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius semisanguineus|C.&nbsp;semisanguineus]]''.<ref name=Arora/> The colour is caused by an elusive [[pigment]] that has been difficult to isolate; its identity was not known until 1998. This is an iron(III) complex of (''R'')-3{{prime}},4{{prime}}-dihydroxy-β-phenylalanine [(''R'')-β-dopa].<ref name=gill2001/> It dissolves in water, turning the liquid dark purple before fading to blackish-grey.<ref name=brandrud1983/> ''C. violaceus'' fruiting bodies contain around 100 times more iron than those of most other fungi.<ref name=gill2001/> ''Cortinarius violaceus'' [[extract]] demonstrates an inhibitory activity against [[cysteine protease]].<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors= Mlinarič A, Kreft S, Umek A, Štrukelj B, Popovič T|year=2000|title=Iskanje inhibitorjev cisteinskih proteinaz v glivah s področja Slovenije|language=Slovenian|trans-title=Cysteine proteinase inhibitors screening of fungal species growing in Slovenia|journal=Acta Pharmaceutica|volume=50|issue=1|pages=39–48}}</ref>
