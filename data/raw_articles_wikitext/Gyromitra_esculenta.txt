'''''Gyromitra esculenta''''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|dʒ|aɪ|r|oʊ|ˈ|m|aɪ|t|r|ə|_|ˌ|ɛ|s|k|j|ə|ˈ|l|ɛ|n|t|ə|,_|ˌ|dʒ|ɪ|r|ə|-}}{{refn|{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Gyromitra}}, {{MerriamWebsterDictionary|esculent}}.}} is an [[ascomycete]] fungus from the genus ''[[Gyromitra]]''. The [[Ascocarp|fruiting body]], or mushroom, is an irregular brain-shaped [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]], dark brown in colour, that can reach {{convert|10|cm|sigfig=1|abbr=off}} high and {{convert|15|cm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide, perched on a stout white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] up to {{convert|6|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} high. It is widely distributed across Europe and North America, normally fruiting in sandy soils under [[coniferous]] trees in spring and early summer.

Although potentially fatal if eaten raw, ''G.&nbsp;esculenta'' is sometimes [[parboil]]ed for consumption, being a popular delicacy in Europe and the upper [[Great Lakes region]] of North America. However, evidence suggests that thorough cooking does not eliminate all toxins. When consumed, the principal active mycotoxin, [[gyromitrin]], is [[hydrolyzed]] into the toxic compound [[monomethylhydrazine]], which [[hepatotoxicity|affects the liver]], [[neurotoxicity|central nervous system]], and sometimes the [[nephrotoxicity|kidneys]]. Symptoms involve vomiting and diarrhea several hours after consumption, followed by dizziness, lethargy and headache. Severe cases may lead to [[delirium]], coma, and death. Recent evidence suggests ''G. esculenta'' may be chronically toxic and linked to regional clusters of [[ALS]].<ref name=":2" />

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was first described in 1800, by mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]], as ''Helvella esculenta'',<ref>Persoon CH (1800) ''Comm. Schaeff. Icon. Pict.'': 64</ref> and gained its current accepted [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] when the Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] placed it in the genus ''Gyromitra'' in 1849.<ref>Fries EM (1849) ''Summa veg. Scand., Section Post''. (Stockholm):p. 346</ref>

''Gyromitra esculenta'' is a member of a group of fungi known as "[[false morel]]s", so named for their resemblance to the highly regarded true morels of the genus ''[[Morchella]]''. The grouping includes other species of the genus ''Gyromitra'', such as ''[[Gyromitra infula|G.&nbsp;infula]]'' (elfin saddle), ''[[Gyromitra caroliniana|G.&nbsp;caroliniana]]'' and ''[[Gyromitra gigas|G.&nbsp;gigas]]'' (snow morel). While some of these species contain little to no gyromitrin, many guidebooks recommend treating them all as poisonous, since their similar appearance and significant intraspecific variation can make reliable identification difficult.<ref name="Gencat">{{Cite web|author=Departament de Salut, [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] |title=Bolets |url=http://www.gencat.cat/salut/depsalut/html/ca/dir2155/csam_6.htm |access-date=20 March 2009 |language=ca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308071936/http://www.gencat.cat/salut/depsalut/html/ca/dir2155/csam_6.htm |archive-date=8 March 2009 }}</ref> The toxic qualities of ''G. esculenta'' may be reduced by cooking, but possibly not enough to prevent poisoning from repeated consumption.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil |url-access=registration |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil/page/363 363]}}</ref>

The more distantly related ascomycete mushrooms of the genus ''[[Verpa]]'', such as ''[[Verpa bohemica|V.&nbsp;bohemica]]'' and ''[[Verpa conica|V.&nbsp;conica]]'', are also known as false morels, early morels or thimble morels; like the ''[[Gyromitra]]'', they are eaten by some and considered poisonous by others.<ref name=Benj267>{{harvnb|Benjamin|1995|p=267}}</ref>

The genus ''Gyromitra'' had been classically considered part of the family [[Helvellaceae]], along with the similar-looking elfin saddles of the genus ''[[Helvella]]''. Analysis of the [[ribosomal DNA]] of many of the [[Pezizales]] showed ''G.&nbsp;esculenta'' and the other false morels to be only distantly related to the other members of the Helvellaceae and instead most closely related to the genus ''[[Discina (fungus)|Discina]]'', forming a [[clade]] which also contains ''[[Pseudorhizina]]'' and ''[[Hydnotrya]]''. Thus the four genera are now included in the family [[Discinaceae]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Donnell |first=Kerry|author2=Cigelnik, Elizabeth|author3=Weber, Nancy S.|author4=Trappe, James M. |year=1997|title=Phylogenetic relationships among ascomycetous truffles and the true and false morels inferred from 18S and 28S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis |journal=Mycologia |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=48–65 |doi=10.2307/3761172 |jstor=3761172}}</ref>

Resembling a brain, the irregularly shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] may be up to {{convert|10|cm|frac=2|abbr=off}} high and {{convert|15|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} wide.

===Similar species===
''G. esculenta'' resembles the various species of true morel, although the latter are more symmetric and look more like pitted gray, tan, or brown [[sponge]]s. Its cap is generally darker and larger.{{sfn|Ammirati|Traquair|Horgen|1985|p=121}}

==Habitat and distribution==
''G. esculenta'' grows on sandy soil in [[temperate coniferous forest]] and occasionally in [[Temperate deciduous forest|deciduous woodlands]].

==Toxicity==
]]

Toxic reactions have been known for at least a hundred years. Experts speculated the reaction was more of an [[Allergic reaction|allergic one]] specific to the consumer, or a misidentification, rather than innate toxicity of the fungus, due to the wide range in effects seen. Some would suffer severely or perish while others exhibited no symptoms after eating similar amounts of mushrooms from the same dish. Yet others would be not poisoned after eating ''G.&nbsp;esculenta'' for many years.<ref name=Benj264>{{harvnb|Benjamin|1995|p=264}}</ref> However, the fungus is now widely recognized as potentially deadly.<ref name=Benj265>{{harvnb|Benjamin|1995|p=265}}</ref>

''Gyromitra esculenta'' contains levels of the poison [[gyromitrin]] that vary locally among populations; although these mushrooms are only rarely involved in poisonings in either [[North America]] or [[western Europe]], intoxications are seen frequently in [[eastern Europe]] and [[Scandinavia]].<ref name="diaz">{{cite journal |author=Diaz JH |title=Syndromic diagnosis and management of confirmed mushroom poisonings |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=427–36 |year=2005 |pmid=15699849|doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000153531.69448.49|s2cid=24492593 }}</ref> A 1971 Polish study reported at the time that the species accounted for up to 23% of mushroom fatalities each year.<ref name="Lampe"/> Death rates have dropped since the mid-twentieth century; in [[Sweden]] poisoning is common, though life-threatening poisonings have not been detected and there was no fatality reported over the 50 years from 1952 to 2002.<ref name="Karlson"/> ''Gyromitra'' poisonings are rare in Spain, due to the widespread practice of drying the mushrooms before preparation and consumption,<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://tratado.uninet.edu/c101102.html | title = Intoxicaciones por setas (micetismos) | access-date = 20 March 2009 | author1 = Palomar Martínez, M. | author2 = Piqueras Carrasco, J. | year = 1999 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090322112813/http://tratado.uninet.edu/c101102.html | archive-date = 22 March 2009 }}</ref> {{Clarify|date=January 2025|text=but has a mortality rate of about 25%}}.<ref name="SantaCreu">{{Cite book | author = Lloret i Carbó, Josep | title = Protocolos terapéuticos de urgencias | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XUcDIfU6yxAC&q=bolet+de+greix&pg=PA649 | page = 649 | isbn = 978-84-458-1418-5 | edition = 4ª | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2004}}</ref>

A [[lethal dose]] of gyromitrin has been estimated to be 10–30&nbsp;mg/kg for children and 20–50&nbsp;mg/kg in adults. These doses correspond to around {{convert|0.2|-|0.6|kg|lboz|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|0.4|-|1|kg|lboz|abbr=on}} of fresh mushroom respectively.<ref name="Michelot"/> Evidence suggests that children are more severely affected; it is unclear whether this is due to a larger weight consumed per body mass ratio or to differences in enzyme and metabolic activity.<ref name="Benj272"/>

===Geographical variation===
Populations of ''G. esculenta'' appear to vary geographically in their toxicity. A French study has shown that mushrooms collected at higher altitudes have lower concentrations of toxin than those from lower elevations,<ref name=Benj272>{{harvnb|Benjamin|1995|p=272}}</ref> and there is some evidence that fungi west of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in North America contain less toxin than those to the east.<ref name=Benj140>{{harvnb|Benjamin|1995|p=140}}</ref> However, poisonings in the USA have been reported,<ref name="Leathem"/> although less frequently than in Europe.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Balterowich L, Blaney B, White S |year=1996 |title=Acute hepatotoxicity following ingestion of ''Gyromitra esculenta''(false morel) mushrooms |journal=Journal of Toxicology.

These other compounds would also produce monomethylhydrazine when hydrolyzed, although it remains unclear how much each contributes to the false morel's toxicity.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pyysalo H |title=Some new toxic compounds in false morels, ''Gyromitra esculenta'' |journal=Naturwissenschaften |volume=62 |issue=8 |page=395 |year=1975 |pmid=1238907 |doi=10.1007/BF00625355|bibcode=1975NW.....62..395P |s2cid=178876 }}</ref>

The toxins react with [[pyridoxal-5-phosphate]]—the activated form of [[pyridoxine]] (vitamin B<sub>6</sub>)—and form a [[hydrazone]].

===Treatment===
Treatment is mainly [[Therapy#Supportive therapy|supportive]]; gastric decontamination with [[activated charcoal]] may be beneficial if medical attention is sought within a few hours of consumption.

===Controversies===
In 2015, Swedish chef {{Interlanguage link multi|Paul Svensson|sv}} caused a controversy when he prepared a dish with ''Gyromitra esculenta'' in a TV show. Mushroom expert Monica Svensson criticized him for including it, because [[monomethylhydrazine]] is a known carcinogen and there is a risk that inexperienced people might misinterpret the recipe and omit the steps that reduce the toxicity level. She also expressed criticism to [[Per Morberg]] for similar reasons. Paul Svensson said that he was not aware of the carcinogenic effects and apologized afterwards, and he promised to remove ''Gyromitra'' from his dishes.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nilsson|first1=Kerstin|title=Här lagar tv-kocken Paul Svensson mat med giftsvamp|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article20690199.ab|access-date=26 April 2015|publisher=Aftonbladet|date=26 April 2015|language=Swedish}}</ref>

===Preparation===
]]

Most of the gyromitrin must be removed to render false morels edible. The recommended procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly.<ref name="EVIRA">{{cite web| title =False Morel Fungi – poisonous when raw | publisher = The Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira| year = 2008 | url =http://www.evira.fi/portal/en/food/information_on_food/false_morel_fungi/ |access-date = 2008-03-04| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071218205805/http://www.evira.fi/portal/en/food/information_on_food/false_morel_fungi/ <!--Added by H3llBot-->| archive-date =18 December 2007}}</ref> To prepare fresh mushroom it is recommended that they are cut into small pieces and [[parboiled]] twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water.<ref name="EVIRA"/> Each round of parboiling reduces the free gyromitrin contents to a tenth.<ref name="Pyysalo">{{cite journal |vauthors=Pyysalo H, Niskanen A |title=On the occurrence of N-methyl-N-formylhydrazones in fresh and processed false morel, ''Gyromitra esculenta'' |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=644–47 |year=1977 |pmid=558239 |doi=10.1021/jf60211a006}}</ref> Significant amounts of gyromitrin are retained in the internal structure of the mushroom even after boiling.

After 5 rounds, this content is reduced to 7%.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AFlfpnaGu4AC&dq=info:KichABaZFzsJ:scholar.google.com/&pg=PA7 |title=Hydrazones in the False Morel |date=1995 |publisher=Nordic Council of Ministers |isbn=978-92-9120-681-0 |page=18 |language=en}}</ref> The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each [[unit operation|round]] of boiling. However, it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.<ref name="EVIRA"/>
