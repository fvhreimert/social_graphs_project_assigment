'''''Crinipellis zonata''''', commonly known as the '''zoned crinipellis''' or the '''zoned-cap collybia''', is a species of [[gilled mushroom]] in the family [[Marasmiaceae]]. It is a [[little brown mushroom]], distinctive because of its thick covering of coarse hairs, and differentiated from other members of ''[[Crinipellis]]'' by its slightly larger [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] size, which reaches up to {{convert|25|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are crowded closely together, and are free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].

[[Saprobic]], it grows on the dead wood of [[deciduous]] trees from late summer to autumn. The fungus is found commonly in eastern North America, but has also been collected in Portugal and Korea. The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''C.&nbsp;zonata'' var. ''cremoricolor'', found in eastern North America, may be distinguished microscopically by its longer [[spore]]s. The species is of unknown [[edible mushroom|edibility]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was first named as ''Agaricus zonatus'' by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1872, based on specimens found near [[Albany, New York]].<ref name="Peck 1872"/> He later transferred it to the genus ''[[Collybia]]'' in 1896.<ref name="Peck 1896"/> It was given its current name by the Italian botanist [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Crinipellis zonata"/>

''Crinipellis zonata'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in subsection ''Crinipellis'' of [[section (biology)|section]] ''Crinipellis'' in the genus ''[[Crinipellis]]'', according to [[Rolf Singer]]'s 1986 arrangement of the [[Agaricales]]. Species in this subsection have elongated spores, and typically lack [[cystidia]] on the sides of [[lamella (mycology)|gills]].<ref name="Singer 1986"/> A 2009 [[phylogenetic]] analysis of several ''Crinipellis'' and ''[[Moniliophthora]]'' species (''Moniliophthora'' are [[Teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|anamorphic]] fungi parasitic on [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] and previously included in  ''Crinipellis''<ref name="Aime 2005"/>) demonstrated that ''C.&nbsp;zonata'' formed a [[clade]] with ''[[Crinipellis rhizomaticola|C.&nbsp;rhizomaticola]]'', ''[[Crinipellis scabella|C.&nbsp;scabella]]'', and ''[[Crinipellis nigricaulis|C.&nbsp;nigricaulis]]''. The conclusions of this analysis, based on the [[DNA sequence]]s of [[ribosomal DNA]] coding for [[internal transcribed spacer]]s, are inconsistent with the [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]-based classification given by Singer.<ref name="Antonin 2009"/>

The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "zoned Crinipellis" or the "zoned-cap Collybia".<ref name="Emberger"/>

==Description==

''Crinipellis zonata'' is a [[little brown mushroom]] with a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, which is convex (sometimes approaching flat) in shape. Typically, it has a small, distinctive depression in the centre, while the whole cap is densely hairy and dry. There are often concentric zones of both color and texture.<ref name="Kuo"/> The cap is tawny or cream, while the hairs (which are set in lines) are tawny. The white [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are close and narrow, and free or nearly free from the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]].<ref name="Phillips"/> The gills do not discolor.<ref name="Kuo"/> The stem is between {{convert|25|and|50|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in height, by {{convert|1|to|2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick. Like the cap, it is densely covered in tawny hairs. Although the stem is hollow,<ref name="Phillips"/> the cap has an insubstantial layer of white flesh.<ref name="Kuo"/>

The [[spore print]] is white, and the smooth, elliptical [[spore]]s are 4–6 by 3–5&nbsp;μm in size.<ref name="Phillips"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 25–30 by 6.0–6.5&nbsp;μm. ''C.&nbsp;zonata'' has ''basidioles''—basidium-like cells in the [[hymenium]] that lack the slender projections known as ''[[sterigmata]]'' that attach to spores. The basidioles are 15–28 by 3.0–8.0&nbsp;μm, and range in shape from club-shaped to cylindrical to fusoid (fuse-like). The cheilocystidia ([[cystidium|cystidia]] found on the edges of gills) are 20–45 by 5.0–9.0&nbsp;μm, cylindrical, club-shaped or fusoid, irregular, and branched or coral-like. Pleurocystidia (cystidia found on the gill face) are absent. The "hairs" on the cap surface are about 50–800 by 4.0–10&nbsp;μm, and roughly cylindrical with an irregular base; the hairs on the stem are similar to the cap hairs.<ref name="Antonin 2009"/> The cap and stem hairs are ''dextrinoid'', meaning that they are [[staining|stained]] yellowish-brown or reddish-brown by the [[iodine]] of [[Melzer's reagent]].<ref name="Miller 2006"/> [[Clamp connection]]s are present in all tissues.<ref name="Antonin 2009"/>

===Variety ''cremoricolor''===
In 1989, Scott Redhead reduced the species ''Crinipellis cremoricolor'' (originally described by Robert L. Shaffer and Margaret G. Weaver in 1965, based on specimens found near the [[University of Michigan Biological Station]]<ref name="Shaffer 1965"/>) to a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''C.&nbsp;crinipellis''.<ref name="Redhead 1989"/> The variety ''cremoricolor'' is found in eastern North America and has longer spores than the nominate variety, measuring 7–12 by 3.8–5&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Miller 2006"/> According to Shaffer and Weaver, it differs macroscopically from the typical variety in having cream- to [[buff (color)|buff]]-colored cap and stem, and pale pinkish-cinnamon gills.<ref name="Shaffer 1965"/>

===Similar species===
Though similar in appearance to other members of ''[[Crinipellis]]'', such as ''[[Crinipellis stipitaria|C.&nbsp;stipitaria]]'' and ''[[Crinipellis piceae|C.&nbsp;piceae]]'', ''C.&nbsp;zonata'' has a slightly larger cap.<ref name="Bessette 2007"/><ref name="Arora 1986"/> The [[Ghana]]ian species ''[[Crinipellis ghanaensis]]'' is also similar, but may be distinguished by its lighter-colored cap without a "corrugated appearance", and its distribution.<ref name="Pegler 1968"/>

==Distribution and ecology==
''Crinipellis zonata'' is [[saprobic]],<ref name="Kuo"/> living on the debris or roots of [[hardwoods]];<ref name="Phillips"/> it contains wood-decaying [[enzyme]]s that can break down the [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] [[pyrene]].<ref name="Cernigli 1997"/> The mushrooms grow individually or in small clusters, and is found between August and September.<ref name="Phillips"/> In North America, it is distributed east of the [[Rocky Mountains]],<ref name="Kuo"/> and has been recorded as far west as [[Indiana]] and [[Texas]].<ref name="Phillips"/> In Europe, it has been collected in Portugal.<ref name="Antonin 1997"/> It has also been collected in South Korea.<ref name="Antonin 2009"/>

== Edibility ==
Fruit bodies of ''Crinipellis zonata'' have no distinct odor, and a mild to slightly mealy taste.<ref name="Kuo" /> Though the [[edible mushroom|edibility]] is not known with certainty, author Roger Phillips lists the species as "Poisonous/Suspect",<ref name="Phillips" /> and [[Orson K. Miller Jr.]] lists it as nonpoisonous.<ref name="Miller 2006" />
