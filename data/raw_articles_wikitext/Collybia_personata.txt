'''''Collybia personata''''' (also recognised as ''Lepista personata'', ''Lepista saeva'', ''Clitocybe saeva'' and ''Tricholoma personatum'', and commonly known as the '''field blewit''' and '''blue-leg''') is a species of edible [[fungus]] commonly found growing in grassy areas across Europe; it is morphologically similar and related to the wood blewit ''[[Collybia nuda]]'' (formerly ''Lepista nuda''). Both mushrooms were moved to the genus ''[[Collybia]]'' in 2023.<ref name="Clitocybaceae-2023">{{Cite journal |last1=He |first1=Zheng-Mi |last2=Chen |first2=Zuo-Hong |last3=Bau |first3=Tolgor |last4=Wang |first4=Geng-Shen |last5=Yang |first5=Zhu L. |date=November 2023 |title=Systematic arrangement within the family Clitocybaceae (Tricholomatineae, Agaricales): phylogenetic and phylogenomic evidence, morphological data and muscarine-producing innovation |url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13225-023-00527-2 |journal=Fungal Diversity |language=en |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=1–47 |doi=10.1007/s13225-023-00527-2 |issn=1560-2745 |s2cid=265474036|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

== Taxonomy ==
This species was originally proclaimed by [[Elias Magnus Fries|Elias Fries]] in 1818, as ''Agaricus personatus''. [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke|Cooke]] proposed in 1871 another name still in use until recently — ''Lepista personata''. Other names were to follow, namely ''Lepista saeva'' by P.D. Orton in 1960 and ''Clitocybe saeva'' by H.E. Bigelow & A.H. Smith in 1969, the latter placing the fungus in the larger genus ''[[Clitocybe]]''.<ref name=taxonomists>{{cite web | title=''Lepista personata'' taxon record details at Index Fungorum | publisher=CAB International | url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=445547|access-date=November 15, 2009}}</ref> In [[Latin]], the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''sævus'' is an [[adjective]] meaning either fierce, outrageous, angry or strong. Likewise, ''personatus'' is a [[participle]] meaning disguised, pretended or false.<ref>{{cite book|vauthors=Jamieson A, Ainsworth R, Morell T | title = Latin dictionary: Morell's abridgment  | publisher = Moon, Boys & Graves| year = 1828|location = London|pages = 400, 476|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_U3oTAAAAYAAJ|quote=latin dictionary. |access-date=2009-10-31}}</ref>

== Description ==
The [[Basidiocarp|fruiting body]] of the mushroom resembles an [[agaric]]. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is at first hemispherical or convex, becoming almost flat with maturity, up to 16&nbsp;cm in diameter. The cap cuticle is colored cream to light brown with a smooth texture to the touch, and is often seen glistening when fresh. Along the periphery, the cap ends in a thick incurved margin which may unfold as the mushroom expands. The white to pallid [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick, firm and delicate upon slicing. The underside of the cap bears crowded pinkish, cream to light brown [[lamellae (mycology)|gills]], which are free or emarginate in relation to the stem. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] itself is cylindrical with a bulbous, or sometimes tapering base, and does not bear a [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The stem is covered by a striking lavender or lilac-coloured fibrous skin which fades in older individuals, and has a thick, firm flesh concolorous with that of the cap. It is up to 6–7&nbsp;cm tall and 2.5–3&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name=Bas1995/><ref name=Yordanov>{{cite book |author1=Yordanov L. |author2=Vanev S. |author3=Fakirova V. |title=The Fungi in Bulgaria (Гъбите в България)|publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] |location=Sofia |year=1978 |page=182 }}</ref>

Under a light microscope, the spores are seen hyaline to pink, ellipsoid in shape, and with fine warts. The spore dimensions are 6-8 by 4-5 [[micrometre|μm]]. ''C. personata'' produces a pale pink [[spore print]].<ref name=Bas1995/><ref name=Yordanov/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
''Collybia personata'' is found fruiting in open grasslands, parks, pastures, forest clearings, and in the vicinity of forest edges, unlike ''Collybia nuda'' which is commonly found in woodland. ''Collybia personata'' fruits gregariously, forming distinctive [[fairy ring]]s.<ref name=Bas1995/><ref name=Yordanov/> Its fruiting season extends from summer to the beginning of winter, and is widespread in [[Europe]].<ref name=Bas1995>{{cite book |author=Bas C. |title=Flora Agaricina Neerlandica : Critical Monographs on Families of Agarics and Boleti Occurring in the Netherlands Vol. 3|publisher=CRC Press |year=1995 |page=74 |isbn=90-5410-616-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NGGiXsS9eYwC&q=neerlandica+saeva&pg=PA67|access-date=2009-11-13}}</ref> In the UK, the season extends from September through to December.

It has also been allegedly reported from [[California]] in [[North America]].<ref name="arora">Arora, David. (1986). ''Mushrooms Demystified''.

== Edibility ==

Field blewits are edible.<ref name="Peterson 2023" />

Blewits can be eaten as a cream sauce or [[Sautéing|sautéed]] in [[butter]]; they can also be cooked like [[tripe]] or as an [[omelette]] filling.<ref name="Mabey01" />

Field blewits are often infested with fly larvae and don't store very well; they should therefore be used soon after picking. They are also very porous, so they are best picked on a dry day.<ref name = "Mabey01">{{cite book | author = Mabey, Richard | year = 2004 | title = Food for Free | publisher = HarperCollins | isbn = 0-00-718303-8 | author-link = Richard Mabey}}</ref>
