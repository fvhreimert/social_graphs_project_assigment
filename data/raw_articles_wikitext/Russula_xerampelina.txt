'''''Russula xerampelina''''', also [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''shrimp russula''',<ref name="Arora2nd" /> '''crab brittlegill''', or '''shrimp mushroom''', is a [[basidiomycete]] [[mushroom]] of the brittlegill genus ''[[Russula]]''. Two subspecies are recognised. The [[basidiocarp|fruiting bodies]] appear in [[coniferous forest|coniferous woodlands]] in autumn in northern Europe and North America. Their [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] are coloured various shades of wine-red, purple to green. Mild tasting and [[edible mushroom|edible]], it is one of the most highly regarded brittlegills for the table. It is also notable for smelling of shellfish or crab when fresh.

== Taxonomy ==

''Russula xerampelina'' was originally described in 1770 as ''Agaricus xerampelina'' from a collection in [[Bavaria]] by the German mycologist [[Jacob Christian Schaeffer]], who noted the colour as ''fusco-purpureus'' or "purple-brown". It was later given its present binomial name by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is taken from the [[Ancient Greek]] meaning "colour of dried vine leaves", ''xeros'' meaning "dry", and ''ampělinos'' or "of the vine".<ref>{{cite book | author = Giovanni Pacioni  | year = 1993 | title = The Macdonald Encyclopedia of Mushrooms and Toadstools (English version) | publisher = Little, Brown & Company Ltd | isbn = 0-316-90625-5}}</ref><ref name=Liddell1980>{{cite book | author = [[Henry George Liddell|Liddell, Henry George]] and [[Robert Scott (philologist)|Robert Scott]] | year = 1980 | title = [[A Greek-English Lexicon]] | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | location = United Kingdom | isbn =0-19-910207-4| edition = Abridged }}</ref>

Two subspecies have been recognised, var. ''xerampelina'' and var. ''tenuicarnosa'', with thinner flesh in the cap and the stipe. The name ''R.&nbsp;erythropoda'' is now considered a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]], and former subspecies ''R.''&nbsp;(''xerampelina'' subsp.) ''amoenipes'' (originally named by [[Henri Romagnesi]]) now a separate species.<ref name="Adamcik">{{cite journal | author = Adamcik, Slavomir | year = 2002 | title = Taxonomy of the ''Russula xerampelina'' group.

As the first defined species, it gives its name to the section ''Xerampelinae'', a group of related species within the genus ''Russula'', occasionally all termed ''R.&nbsp;xerampelina'' in the past.<ref name="Adamcik"/>

[[Common name]]s include shrimp mushroom, shrimp Russula, crab brittlegill, and shellfish-scented Russula.

== Description ==



''Russula xerampelina'' has a characteristic odour of boiled crab or shrimp. Trimethylamine and its precursor, trimethylamine {{nowrap|''N''-oxide}}, are the source of this mushroom’s distinct odour.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = William F. | last2 = Largent | first2 = David L. | last3 = DeShazer | first3 = Darvin A. | year = 2024 | title = The cooked shellfish-odour of the mushroom Russula xerampelina | journal = Biosystematics and Ecology | volume = 3 | pages = 1–3  | doi=10.1553/biosystecol.3.e115244| doi-access = free }}</ref> The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|5|–|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=117–118|oclc=797915861}}</ref><ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=204}}</ref> domed, flat, or with a slightly depressed centre, and sticky. The colour is variable, most commonly purple to wine-red, or greenish, and darker towards the centre of the cap. There are fine grooves up to 1&nbsp;cm long running perpendicular to the margin.

The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|4–12|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1.5–4|cm|abbr=on|round=0.5}} wide, cylindrical, white or sometimes with a reddish blush, bruising brown.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] have a mild to rather bitter taste, narrowly spaced, and turn creamy-yellow on aging specimens. The [[spore print]] is creamy-yellow to [[ochre]]. The oval spores measure 8.8–9.9 by 6.7–7.8&nbsp;[[μm]] and are covered with 1&nbsp;μm spines.<ref name="Adamcik" />

This ''Russula'' has been divided into several similar species by some mycologists. However, they all have the singular dark green colour reaction to iron salts ([[iron(II) sulfate]]) when applied to the flesh and smell of shellfish. This aroma is quite distinct and becomes stronger with age.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Thomas Laessoe | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref>

=== Similar species ===
More reddish-capped forms could be confused with the sickener (''[[Russula emetica|R.&nbsp;emetica]]''), although the latter always has a white stipe and gills; greener-capped species may resemble ''[[Russula aeruginea|R.&nbsp;aeruginea]]''.<ref name="Nilper">{{cite book |author=Nilson S & Persson O |title=Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi |publisher=Penguin |year=1977 |isbn=0-14-063006-6 |page=122}}</ref>

Many other species in the genus are similar, e.g. ''[[Russula graveolens|R.&nbsp;graveolens]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trudell |first1=Steve |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest |last2=Ammirati |first2=Joe |publisher=Timber Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5 |series=Timber Press Field Guides |location=Portland, OR |pages=54}}</ref> but most lack the seafood smell. ''[[Russula olivacea]]'' has a more velvety cap.<ref name="audu" />

== Distribution and habitat ==

''Russula xerampelina'' is widely distributed; quite common in northern [[temperate]] zones, and often ranging into the [[Arctic Circle]], it also ranges south to [[Costa Rica]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Kuo |date=January 2005 |title=Russula xerampelina |work=Mushroomexpert |url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/russula_xerampelina.html|access-date=2008-08-26}}</ref> In North America, it appears from July to October to the east and October to January in the west.<ref name="audu" /> It grows solitary, or in groups with [[conifer]]s,<ref name="Arora2nd">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/102/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=102–103 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> and seems to have a preference for [[Douglas fir]], or more rarely [[pine trees]] or [[larch]].<ref name=Adamcik/> It is sometimes found in [[deciduous]] woods, such as [[beech]] and [[oak]].<ref name=Nilper/>

Variety ''tenuicarnosa'' has been found on sandy soils under pine in Slovakia and northern Italy in [[Trentino]].<ref name=Adamcik/>

== Uses ==

The flavor is mild.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |orig-year=2005 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=137}}</ref> This russula is considered one of the best [[edible mushroom|edible]] species of its genus, although the shellfish smell will persist even when cooking.
