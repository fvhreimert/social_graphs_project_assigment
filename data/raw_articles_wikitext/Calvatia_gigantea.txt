'''''Calvatia gigantea''''', commonly known in English as the '''giant puffball''', is a [[puffball]] mushroom found in meadows, fields, and deciduous forests in late summer and autumn. It is found in temperate areas throughout the world. It is edible when young.

== Taxonomy ==
The classification of this species has been revised in recent decades. Puffballs, earthballs, earthstars, stinkhorns and several other kinds of fungi were once thought to be related and were known as the gasteromycetes or 'stomach' fungi, because the fertile material develops inside spherical or pear-shaped fruitbodies; however, this group is now known to be [[polyphyletic]].<ref name="firstnature">{{Cite web |title=Calvatia gigantea, Giant Puffball, identification |url=https://first-nature.com/fungi/calvatia-gigantea.php |access-date=2023-12-01 |website=first-nature.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hibbett DS et al. | year = 1997 | title = Evolution of gilled mushrooms and puffballs inferred from ribosomal DNA sequences | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 94 | issue = 22| pages = 12002–12006 | doi=10.1073/pnas.94.22.12002 | pmid=9342352 | pmc=23683| bibcode = 1997PNAS...9412002H | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Kruger D et al. | year = 2001 | title = The Lycoperdales.

Today, some authors place the giant puffball and other members of genus ''[[Calvatia]]'' in order [[Agaricales]]. The giant puffball has also been placed in two other genera, ''Lycoperdon'' and ''Langermannia'', in years past. The current view is that the giant puffball belongs in ''Calvatia''.<ref name="TomVolk">{{cite web |last=Volk |first=First |title=Tom Volk's Fungus of the Month for August 1998 |url=http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/aug98.html |access-date=6 October 2012}}</ref>

===Similar species===
Giant puffballs resemble the [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] earthball (''[[Scleroderma citrinum]]''). The latter are distinguished by a much firmer, elastic fruiting body, and having an interior that becomes dark purplish-black with white reticulation early in development.

Identification techniques make it relatively easy to distinguish from others of its genus.<ref name="audu" />

==Habitat and distribution==
The giant puffball is commonly found in meadows, fields, and deciduous forests in late summer and autumn. It is found in [[Temperate climate|temperate areas]] throughout the world.<ref name="Kew">{{citation |title=Discover plants and fungi |url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/calvatia-gigantea-giant-puffball |access-date=8 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161222204354/http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/plants-fungi/calvatia-gigantea-giant-puffball |archive-date=2016-12-22 |chapter=''Calvatia gigantea'' (giant puffball) |publisher=www.kew.org}}</ref>

==Conservation==
It is widespread and common in the United Kingdom<ref name="Kew" /> and North America (August–October) except for the southeast United States.<ref name="audu" /> It is protected in parts of Poland and is of conservation concern in Norway.<ref name="Kew" />

==Uses==


===Culinary===

The large white mushrooms are [[Edible mushroom|edible]] when young, as are all true puffballs, but they can cause digestive issues if the spores have begun to form—as indicated by the flesh being yellowish or greenish-brown instead of pure white.<ref name="Arora" /><ref name="Bessette" />{{Verify source|date=June 2025|reason=Arora was cited to ''Clitocybe gigantea'', need to be sure.}} An overripe puffball will fall apart when touched or if cut open, and should be discarded.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lovesick Lake Native Women's Association |title=The Rural and Native Heritage Cookbook |publisher=Paul-Printing (Community Publication) |year=1985 |isbn=0-9692-255-0-4 |edition=1 |location=Burleigh Falls, Ontario |pages=101}}</ref> Some people experience a laxative effect from eating this species.<ref name="Arora" />

Immature gilled species still contained within their [[universal veil]] can look similar to puffballs. Many such species are poisonous, or even deadly. To distinguish puffballs from such poisonous fungi, they are cut open; edible puffballs have a solid white interior and have "no gills or other imperfections".<ref>{{cite book |last=Meuninck |first=Jim |title=Foraging Mushrooms Oregon: Finding, Identifying, and Preparing Edible Wild Mushrooms |date=2017 |publisher=[[Falcon Guides]] |isbn=978-1-4930-2669-2 |page=38}}</ref><ref name="Star"/>
