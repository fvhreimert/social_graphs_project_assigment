'''''Psilocybe naematoliformis''''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the mushroom [[family (biology)|family]] [[Hymenogastraceae]]. It is a [[psilocybin mushroom]], having [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as the main active [[hallucinogenic]] compounds.

==Discovery and classification==
The species was originally found by mycologist [[Gastón Guzmán]] in a [[tropical rainforest]] at [[Uxpanapa]] Region, in the State of [[Veracruz]] in southeastern Mexico; he reported the finding in a 1979 publication, and called the fungus ''Psilocybe naematoliformis''.<ref name=Guzman1979/> Guzmán later considered species with chrysocystidia ([[cystidia]] whose contents contain a distinct refractive yellow body, that become more deeply yellow when [[staining|stained]] with ammonia or other alkaline compounds) to be separate from ''Psilocybe'', and transferred the species first to ''Naematoloma'' in 1980,<ref name=Guzman1980/> and then later to ''[[Hypholoma]]'' in 1999.<ref name=Guzman1999/> In 2004, Guzmán revised his opinion again, and considered the species more suitably placed in ''Psilocybe''.<ref name=Guzman2004/>

''P.&nbsp;naematoliformi'' is in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Neocaledonicae'', a group of related [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] species in the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]''; other members of the section include ''[[Psilocybe aequatoriae]]'' ([[Ecuador]]), ''[[Psilocybe neocaledonicum]]'' ([[New Caledonia]]), and ''[[Psilocybe neorhombispora]]'' (Mexico).<ref name=Guzman2004/>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|1|–|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, bell-shaped to subumbonate, smooth, and slightly slimy but soon dry. The color may range from a pale orange-brown to a deep rusty brown. It is [[hygrophanous]], fading to [[buff (color)|buff]]; the color is blackish brown when dry, and slightly translucent-striate when wet. Like other hallucinogenic psilocybes, it stains blue when bruised or injured. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] in attachment to the stem, or may be notched at the point of attachment ([[wikt:sinuate|sinuate]]). They are narrow, and brownish violet to dark violet, with whitish edges. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3.5|–|5.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall by 1–3&nbsp;mm thick, subequal, [[wikt:flexuous|flexuous]], and hollow. The color of the stem is reddish-brown or brownish; it is densely covered with silk-like fibers, and tufts of soft woolly hairs. The [[veil (botany)|veil]] does not form an [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]]. The taste of this species has been described as slightly bitter, and the smell slightly [[farinaceous]], like grain.<ref name=Guzman2008/>

===Microscopic features===
The [[spores]] have dimensions of (3.8)4.9–5.5(6.6) by (3.3)4.4–5(6.6) by 3.8–4.4 μm, sublentiform (shaped somewhat like a biconvex lens) in face view or roughly elliptic in side view, with an inconspicuous [[wikt:hilar appendage|hilar appendage]]. They have a distinct [[germ pore]] in the base, and are smooth and thick-walled. The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]], are 12–19 by 4.4–5.5&nbsp;μm, and [[hyaline]].<ref name=Guzman2008/> The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are 15–29 by 5.5–8.8&nbsp;μm; clear, gray or brown in color, fusoid-ventricose to mucronate, sometimes with a median constriction, similar to the species ''[[Psilocybe subaeruginosa]]'' Clel. from Australia.<ref name=Guzman1979/> The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 12–28 by 5.5–7.7&nbsp;μm, hyaline, very numerous, ventricose, mucronate or fusiform-lanceolate, often forked.<ref name=Guzman2008/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Psilocybe naematoliformis'' is found growing in small groups, in tufts or clumps, on disturbed places of the virgin tropical rain forest; it grows in soil with a few [[herbaceous]] plants.<ref name=Guzman2008/> This species was originally found in [[Mexico]], [[State of Veracruz]], [[Uxpanapa]] region,.<ref name=Guzman1979/>
