'''''Russula betularum''''' is a small, very pale member of the ''[[Russula]]'' (brittlegills) [[genus]] of [[mushroom]]s. It is usually white to very pale pink, inedible, and grows with [[birch]] trees. It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''birch brittlegill'''.

==Taxonomy==
The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''betularum'' "of the birches",<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| date = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref> refers to its association with birch (''[[Betula]]'' species). Some sources regard it as a variety of the sickener (''[[Russula emetica|R.&nbsp;emetica]]'').

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is convex to flattened, and often has a central depression. On expansion the margin becomes furrowed, and bears low warts. It is {{convert|2|–|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, and the cuticle may be peeled off completely. The cap ranges in colour from white to pale pink, to deep pink, and can even be pale [[buff (color)|buff]]. Although more often it is white with a pale pink blush, turning pale yellow ochre in the centre. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is typically longer than the diameter of the cap, and is cylindrical or slightly club-shaped. It is white, and very fragile. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are also white, and well spaced, and the [[spore print]] is white. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white and tastes hot.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book| author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page= 20}}</ref> It might be confused with ''[[Russula fragilis]]'' ([[Christian Hendrik Persoon|Pers.]]) [[Elias Magnus Fries|Fr.]] which can be pale in colour, and occur in the same habitat. However, the cuticle of the latter species is only three quarters peeling, usually darker at the centre, and with purplish tones. It also has marked serrations on the gill edges.

==Distribution and habitat==
'''''Russula betularum''''' appears in summer and early autumn. It is widespread in Britain, Europe, and Scandinavia, and is probably [[mycorrhizal]] with [[birch]] trees. It often grows in damp places in woodlands.<ref name=Phillips06/>

==Edibility==
This mushroom is inedible, and has a hot 'peppery' taste.<ref name=Phillips06/> Many bitter tasting red-capped species can cause problems if eaten raw; the symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: [[diarrhoea]], vomiting and [[colic]]ky abdominal cramps. The active agent has not been identified but thought to be [[sesquiterpene]]s, which have been isolated from the related genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'' and from ''[[Russula sardonia]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Benjamin| first= Denis R. |title=Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas — a handbook for naturalists, mycologists and physicians|page= 369|publisher=WH Freeman and Company| location=New York |year=1995| isbn=0-7167-2600-9}}</ref>
