'''''Aureoboletus mirabilis''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''admirable bolete''', the '''bragger's bolete''', and the '''velvet top''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the [[Boletaceae]] mushroom [[family (biology)|family]]. The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] has a dark reddish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], yellow to greenish-yellow pores on the undersurface of the cap, and a reddish-brown [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] with long narrow reticulations.

''Aureoboletus mirabilis'' is found in [[conifer]]ous forests along the [[Pacific Coast]] of North America, and in Asia. Unusual for boletes, ''A.&nbsp;mirabilis'' sometimes appears to fruit on the wood or woody debris of [[Hemlock tree]]s, suggesting a [[saprobic]] lifestyle. Despite the occasional appearances to the contrary, ''A.&nbsp;mirabilis'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l, and forms a close association with the tree's roots. The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]].

==Taxonomy==
''Aureoboletus mirabilis'' was first described by American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1912 as ''Ceriomyces mirabilis'', based on specimens found in [[Seattle]], Washington.<ref name="Murrill1912a"/> In a subsequent publication that same year, he switched the [[genus]] to ''[[Boletus]]''.<ref name="Murrill1912"/> In 1940, fungal taxonomist [[Rolf Singer]] transferred the [[taxon]] to the genus ''[[Xerocomus]]'';<ref name=Singer1940/> five years later he switched it to ''[[Boletellus]]''.<ref name="Singer1945"/> However, many mycologists did not recognize the distinction between ''Boletus'' and ''Boletellus'' before [[molecular phylogenetics]] studies found them to be distinct genera. In 1966, American mycologist [[Harry Delbert Thiers]] wrote about the issue in his survey of California boletes:

<blockquote>The proper disposition of this species in the present taxonomic scheme of the boletes is somewhat debatable. ... The distinction between ''Boletus'' and ''Boletellus'' is not so clear-cut. The spores are typically smooth which, in conjunction with the divergent tube trama, dry to moist pileus and yellow tubes, seem to place it very convincingly in ''Boletus''. However, the present disposition in ''Boletellus'' seems most satisfactory to me. The sporocarps have the stature and general appearance of other members of that genus such as ''Boletellus russellii'' and ''B.&nbsp;ananas'' (Curt.) Murr. These similarities include the disproportionately long stipe which is frequently shaggy-reticulate and constricted at the apex, and a comparatively small pileus.<ref name=Thiers1966/></blockquote>

Nine years later, after further consideration, Thiers changed his mind:

<blockquote>In an earlier paper this species was considered to belong to the genus ''Boletellus'' because of its stature, general appearance, and because some workers had reported the spores as being obscurely punctate or roughened. Repeated examinations of California material have failed to reveal any roughened spores and since, in modern concepts ''Boletellus'' is restricted to species having such spores, it has been placed back in ''Boletus''.<ref name="CAboletes"/></blockquote>

The species has also been placed in genus ''[[Heimioporus]]'', newly described in 2004 by Swiss mycologist Egon Horak.<ref name="urlMycoBank"/><ref name=Horak2004/> In 2015 it was transferred to the genus ''[[Aureoboletus]]'' based on DNA evidence.<ref name="Halling 2015"/>

In a 2001 analysis of [[ribosomal DNA]] sequences for a number of [[taxa]] in the [[Boletales]] order, ''A.&nbsp;mirabilis'' was found to be most closely related to species such as ''[[Boletus edulis]]'', ''[[Phylloporus rhodoxanthus]]'', and ''[[Tylopilus felleus]]''. Within the Boletales [[clade]] (a group of related species roughly equivalent to the Boletales order), these species were all in the so-called "boletoid radiation", a group of taxa that are thought to have diverged evolutionarily from a single boletoid ancestor.<ref name="Grubisha2001"/> However, more recent studies containing more taxa have found ''A.&nbsp;mirabilis'' to be most closely related to ''Aureoboletus'' species.<ref name="Halling 2015"/>

===Etymology===
The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''mirabilis'' means "admirable" or "marvelous".<ref name="Smith1980"/> ''Aureoboletus mirabilis'' is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "admirable bolete",<ref name="Arora1986"/> the "bragger's bolete",<ref name="McKnight1987"/> and the "velvet top".<ref name="Laport2006"/>

==Description==
{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Boletellus mirabilis 28545 crop.jpg|image2=Boletus mirabilis 65808.jpg|width=200|caption1=Spores are produced in minute tubes, which appear on the underside of the cap as pores.|caption2=Closeup of pore surface}}

The [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of the fruit bodies are up to {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter, red or brownish-red in color, initially convex but flattening out as they develop.<ref name=Murrill1912a/> The cap is fleshy, with a rough surface that is slippery or slimy in young specimens, or in moist environments. Older specimens generally have dry and velvety cap surfaces.<ref name="CAboletes"/> The texture of the cap surface is rough, at first because of flattened-down ([[wikt:appressed|appressed]]) fibrils, and later with bent-back ([[wikt:recurved|recurved]]) scales or sometimes with cracked rough patches that resemble dried cracked mud. Young specimens may have a small flap of thin tissue attached to the margin or edge of the cap, remnants of a reduced [[partial veil]].<ref name="Miller2006"/> The surface is covered with tufts of soft woolly hairs, and has persistent [[Plant cuticle|papilla]]e.<ref name="Murrill1912a"/>

The tubes underneath the cap are up to {{convert|2.5|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} long,<ref name="Tylutki II 1987"/> and are initially pale yellowish before becoming greenish-yellow with age, or mustard-yellow if injured. The pores have diameters of 1–2&nbsp;mm. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] can be pale pink, yellow, or white in color, sometimes with hints of blue, and is usually red just beneath the surface.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=217–218}}</ref> The flesh is firm but watery, thick, and either not changing color or becoming deeper yellow with bruising.<ref name="CAboletes"/> It is {{convert|1 to 1.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick at the junction of the stem with the cap.<ref name="urlSIFERP"/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to {{convert|18|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long,<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=320}}</ref> usually thickest at the base and tapering upward, up to {{convert|4|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick below and {{convert|0.5 to 1|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} at the apex. It typically starts out with a bulbous shape but becomes more equal in width throughout as it matures. The surface is dry, often roughened and pitted, and with a network of grooves or ridges ([[wikt:striation|striations]]) or [[wikt:reticulation|reticulations]] near the top of the stem. It is about the same color as the cap, but will bruise to a darker reddish-brown near the base. The stem is solid (that is, not hollow), and its flesh pale purplish at the top, but yellowish below. [[Mycelium]] at the base of the stem is also yellow.<ref name="urlSIFERP"/>

===Microscopic characteristics===
Collected in [[spore print|deposit]], the [[Basidiospore|spores]] are olive-brown.<ref name="Murrill1912a"/> Viewed with a microscope, the spores are spindle-shaped to roughly elliptical, with smooth, thick walls, and have dimensions of 18–22 by 7–9&nbsp;[[μm]]. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20–26 by 8–9&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Overholts1940"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, [[hyaline]] (translucent), {{nowrap|4-spored}}, and 31–36 by 7–11&nbsp;μm. [[Cystidia]] (sterile cells on the face of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60–90 by 10–18&nbsp;μm.<ref name="CAboletes"/> There are no [[clamp connection]]s present in the hyphae.<ref name="Tylutki II 1987"/>

===Chemical reactions===
[[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|Chemical tests]] are sometimes used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. [[Pigment]]s present in the fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions may be used as taxonomic [[character (biology)|characters]]. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of [[ammonium hydroxide]] is applied to the cap of ''B.&nbsp;mirabilis'', the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial [[bleach]] (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.<ref name=Baroni1978/>

===Similar species===
''Aureoboletus mirabilis'' differs from other boletes in the covering of the cap, which superficially resembles that found on the surface of the tan-to-pinkish-brown ''[[Boletellus ananas]]'' and the dark brown or black ''[[Strobilomyces strobilaceus]]'', but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color and the absence of a veil, which the other two possess.<ref name="Murrill1912a"/> ''Boletus edulis'' is separated from ''A.&nbsp;mirabilis'' by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. ''[[Boletus coniferarum]]'' turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste.<ref name="urlSIFERP"/> ''[[Aureoboletus projectellus]]'' is also similar in appearance, but is found in eastern North America,<ref name="Bessette1992"/> as is ''[[Boletellus chrysenteroides]]''. ''[[Xerocomellus atropurpureus]]'' is usually smaller.<ref name="audu" />

==Habitat and distribution==
, Washington state]]

The fruit bodies grow solitarily, scattered, or sometimes in small groups on the ground or on well-decayed [[conifer]] logs, especially of [[Tsuga heterophylla|western]] and [[mountain hemlock]], but occasionally also [[Douglas-fir]] and [[western red cedar]].<ref name="Bessette1992"/> The fungus is strongly suspected to form [[mycorrhiza]]l associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing ''B.&nbsp;mirabilis'' mycorrhizae in [[microbiological culture|laboratory culture]] have failed.<ref name="Kropp1982"/> Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot—a trait suggestive of [[cellulose]]-decomposing [[Detritivore|saprobic]] fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that ''B.&nbsp;mirabilis'' has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for fungal growth.<ref name="Kropp1982"/>

''Aureoboletus mirabilis'', which usually appears from late summer to autumn, is distributed in the hemlock forests of the [[Pacific Coast Ranges]] from [[Northern California]] to [[Alaska]], the [[Cascade Range]], as well as in interior forests such as in [[Manitoba]].<ref name="CAboletes"/><ref name="Overholts1940"/><ref name="Snell1936"/> It has a [[disjunct distribution]], as it has been also been collected in [[Japan]] and [[Taiwan]].<ref name=Hongo1973/><ref name="Hongo1985"/>

==Uses==
''Aureoboletus mirabilis'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]], yet tasteless according to Murrill, who also noted that "this is one of the most difficult species to preserve, owing to its extremely juicy consistency".<ref name="Murrill1912a"/> In contrast, modern [[field guide]]s suggest this species to be an excellent edible.<ref name="CAboletes"/><ref name="McKnight1987"/> One book opines that only ''Boletus edulis'' surpasses its flavour.<ref name="Strybel2005"/> When [[sauteed]] in butter, the flesh has been noted to have a lemony taste.<ref name="Bessette1992"/>

Field specimens covered with the white mold ''Sepedonium ampullosporum'' should not be consumed.<ref name="Smith1980" /> The mushroom may also be attacked by ''[[Hypomyces chrysospermus]]''.<ref name=":0" />
