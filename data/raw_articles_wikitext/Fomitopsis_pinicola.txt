'''''Fomitopsis pinicola''''', is a [[Wood-decay fungus|stem-decay]] fungus. Its [[conk (fungi)|conk]] (fruit body) is known as the '''red-belted conk''' or '''red-belted bracket'''. The species is common throughout [[temperate]] Eurasia. It is a decay fungus that serves as a small-scale disturbance agent in coastal rainforest ecosystems. It influences stand structure and succession in [[temperate rainforests]]. It performs essential [[nutrient cycle|nutrient cycling]] functions in forests. As well as a key producer of brown rot residues that are stable soil components in [[conifer]]ous forest ecosystems.

==Taxonomy==
There is currently a splitting of ''F.&nbsp;pinicola'' occurring to isolate distinct species that have all previously been classified as ''F.&nbsp;pinicola.'' [[DNA analysis]] supports splitting ''F.&nbsp;pinicola'' into three groups- ''F.&nbsp;pinicola'', ''[[Fomitopsis mounceae|F.&nbsp;mounceae]]'', and ''[[Fomitopsis schrenkii|F.&nbsp;schrenkii]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last1=Haight |first1=John-Erich |last2=Nakasone |first2=Karen K. |last3=Laursen |first3=Gary A. |last4=Redhead |first4=Scott A. |last5=Taylor |first5=D.

The pore surface is pale yellow to leather-brown, 3–4 pores per mm. It grows as thick shelves on live and dead coniferous or (less commonly) deciduous trees.<ref name="FS-R10-FHP 2014.

The [[Sporocarp (fungus)|fruiting body]] of ''F.&nbsp;pinicola'' is called the ''conk''. It is a woody, [[Pileus (mycology)|pileate]] fruiting body with pores lined with [[Basidium|basidia]] on its underside. As in other polypores, the fruiting body is perennial with a new layer of pores produced each year on the bottom of the old pores. The pores are whitish when young and become somewhat brownish in age.<ref name="FS-R10-FHP 2014. PAGES 30 & 31"/>

This stem decay fungus is found on live [[conifer]] trees in [[southeast Alaska]] such as [[Western hemlock]], [[Mountain hemlock]], [[White spruce]], [[Lutz spruce]] and [[Sitka spruce]]. The tree stem decay is caused by the fungus when it invades and colonizes the wood of living trees and decomposes the wood before the tree is dead. This brown rot fungus degrades only cellulose, leaving the other primary constituents of wood, [[lignin]], as a considerably less dense but fairly stable residual structure<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=E.

This fungus is normally found on dead [[pine]]s, but can be found on all conifers. It can also be observed growing on large stem wounds, broken tops, and dead tissue of live trees.<ref name=":3" /> In mature forests, these stem decay fungi cause enormous annual wood volume loss of Alaska's major tree species. Approximately one-third of the old-growth timber board-foot volume in Southeast Alaska is defective, largely due to decay from this type of fungus. Conversely, there is very little decay in young-growth stands without prevalent wounding from commercial [[thinning]] activities, wind damage, or animal feeding. By predisposing large old trees to bole breakage and windthrow, stem decays serve as important small-scale disturbance regimes in these temperate rainforest ecosystems where fire and other large-scale disturbances are uncommon.<ref name="FS-R10-FHP 2014. PAGES 40-42">FS-R10-FHP. 2014. Forest Health Conditions in Alaska 2013. Anchorage, Alaska. USDA Forest Service, Alaska Region. Publication R10-PR-035.81 PAGES 40-42.</ref>

This stem decay creates canopy gaps, influences stand structure and succession, increases [[biodiversity]], and enhances wildlife habitat. The fungus also performs essential [[nutrient cycling]] functions'''<ref name="FS-R10-FHP 2014. PAGES 40-42" />''' in these forests by decomposing stems, branches, roots, and boles of dead trees. Cavities created by the fungus in standing trees provide crucial habitat for many wildlife species including [[bears]], [[voles]], [[squirrels]], and a number of [[bird]] species. The lack of disturbance in these areas and longevity of individual trees allows ample time for this slow-growing decay fungus to cause significant decay. There is a growing interest in acquiring methods to promote earlier development of stem decays in second-growth stands to achieve wildlife and other non-timber objectives.<ref name="FS-R10-FHP 2014. PAGES 40-42" />

=== Stem decay characteristics ===
Most of the stem decay (heart rot) in mature forests that results from this fungus does not interfere with the normal growth and physiological processes of live trees since the [[vascular tissue]] is not affected. It is classified as a [[Brown rot (wood decay)|brown rot]], which primarily degrades [[cellulose]] in tree stands. The early stage of wood decay appears as yellowish to brownish discoloration with the advanced stage appearing as a brown and crumbly breaking into cubical pieces.<ref name=":3" /> Wood impacted by this fungus may become more brittle and prone to breakage in high winds, and cannot be used for pulp production.<ref name="FS-R10-FHP 2014. PAGES 40-42" /> This species requires exposed wood of wounds for entry, continuing their decay after the tree dies. On dead trees, the fungus general affects the sapwood and then progresses into [[heartwood]].<ref name=":3" />

The fruiting bodies of the fungus produce abundant [[basidiocarp]]s and basidiospores which are generally dispersed in air currents and germinate upon contact with wood or other substrates,<ref name=":3" /> but the actual degradation of the wood is by the [[Mycelium|thread-like vegetative]] part of the fungus inside the trees. The fungus can occur anywhere on roots or the stem, but is most common low on the bole, where frequent wounds promote infection.<ref name="FS-R10-FHp 2014. PAGES 4" />
