'''''Lactarius blennius''''' ([[common name|commonly]] known as the '''slimy milkcap''' or '''beech milkcap''') is a medium-sized [[mushroom]] of the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'' found commonly in [[beech]] forests in Europe, where it is [[mycorrhizal]], favouring the [[European beech]] (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of [[latex|milk]]. It has been the subject of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with ''Lactarius''. The edibility of ''L.&nbsp;blennius'' is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is [[edible mushroom|edible]] (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.

==Taxonomy and naming==
''Lactarius blennius'' was first described by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus blennius'' in 1815, before being given its current binomial name by the same author in 1838.<ref name=nilper/> Within the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'', it is closely related to ''Lactarius cinereus'', another ''Lactarius'' species that also favours [[beech]].<ref name="Bills"/> It has been suggested that the two species (forming a group) could have a [[coevolution]]ary pathway with beech.<ref name="Bills"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from a [[Latin]] adjective ''blennius'', meaning "slimy".<ref name=nilper>{{cite book | last = Nilson|first= Sven |author2=Olle Persson  | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page= 100}}</ref> ''Lactarius'' mushrooms are [[common name|commonly]] known as milkcaps,<ref name="Sterry">{{cite book |title= Complete Guide to British Mushrooms & Toadstools|author1=Sterry, Paul |author2=Hughes, Barry |year= 2009|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|isbn= 978-0-00-723224-6|page= 52}}</ref> and ''L. blennius'' is known as the Slimy Milkcap<ref name="Phillips"/> or the Beech Milkcap.<ref name="Sterry"/>

''Lactarius blennius'' is [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''Agaricus blennius'' (the name under which Fries first described the species in 1815) and ''Agaricus viridis'', a name given earlier by [[Heinrich Schrader (botanist)|Heinrich Schrader]], in 1794. ''Galorrheus blennius'' (a name proposed in 1871 by [[Paul Kummer]]), ''Lactarius viridis'' (proposed in 1888 by [[Lucien Quélet]]) and ''Lactifluus blennius'' (proposed by [[Otto Kuntze]] in 1891) are also now recognised as synonyms.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.speciesfungorum.org/Names/SynSpecies.asp?RecordID=219169|title= ''Lactarius blennius'' synonymy|publisher= [[Index Fungorum]]|access-date=12 September 2010}}</ref> ''Lactarius albidopallens'' was originally described as a [[form (botany)|form]] of ''L. blennius'' as ''Lactarius blennius'' f. ''albidopallens'' by [[Jakob Emanuel Lange]] in 1928, before being classified as a separate species by J. Blum.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/HomoSpecies.asp?RecordID=258570|title= ''Lactarius blennius f. albidopallens''|publisher= [[Index Fungorum]]|access-date=12 September 2010}}</ref> Lange also described ''Lactarius blennius'' f.

However today ''L. fluens'' is normally regarded as a related but separate species, distinguished by a pale cap margin, less sliminess and a deeper cream gill colour.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=459444|title= ''Lactarius blennius var. fluens''|publisher= [[Index Fungorum]]|access-date=12 September 2010}}</ref><ref name="FungaNordica">{{cite book |editor-first1=Thomas |editor-last1=Knudsen |editor-first2=J. |editor-last2=Vesterholt |title=Funga Nordica Agaricoid, boletoid, clavarioid, cyphelloid and gasteroid genera |publisher=Nordsvamp |location=Copenhagen |year=2018 |page=135 |isbn=978-87-983961-3-0 }}</ref>  
The situation with ''Lactarius viridis'' is similar but with a different outcome; it was first described as a separate species by Quélet in 1888, and then in 1980 A. Marchand proposed that it is in fact a variety of ''L. blennius'', naming it ''Lactarius blennius var. viridis.''  In this case the synonymy has become accepted.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=456054|title= ''Lactarius blennius var. viridis''|publisher= [[Index Fungorum]]|access-date=12 September 2010}}</ref>

==Description==
''Lactarius blennius'' has a flattened convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is 4–10&nbsp;cm (1.6–4&nbsp;in) across that later becomes depressed in the centre. In colour, it is pale [[Olive (colour)#Olive|olive]] to a greenish grey, sometimes a dull green or pale grey-[[sepia (color)|sepia]], and has blotches of darker colouration in [[concentric]] bands,<ref name="Phillips">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe|last= Phillips|first= Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page= 83}}</ref> though the colour can vary greatly. Heavily spotted specimens are also known,<ref name="Sterry"/> and a very brown specimen similar to ''Lactarius circellatus'' was recorded in Scotland.<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.2307/4113927 |author= Dennis, Richard William George |author-link= R.

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is a paler colour than the cap, but also very slimy, and measures from 4–5&nbsp;cm (1.6–2&nbsp;in) tall by 1–1.7&nbsp;cm (0.4–0.7&nbsp;in) thick,<ref name="Phillips"/> tapering a little towards the bottom.<ref name="Pegler">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Toadstools|last= Pegler|first= David N.|year= 1983|publisher= Mitchell Beazley Publishing|location= London|isbn= 0-85533-500-9|page= 115}}</ref> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, similar in colour to the [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]], which later become a creamy or pale [[buff (colour)|buff]] colour.
