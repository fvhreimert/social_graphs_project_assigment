'''''Panaeolus bisporus''''', also known as '''Copelandia bisporus''' is a rare and widely distributed little brown mushroom that bruises blue and contains the psychedelic compound [[psilocybin]].

This mushroom is similar macroscopically to ''[[Panaeolus tropicalis]]'', ''[[Panaeolus cambodginiensis]]'' and ''[[Panaeolus cyanescens]]'', but can be differentiated using a microscope by its two spored basidia.
