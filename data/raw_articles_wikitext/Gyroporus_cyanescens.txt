'''''Gyroporus cyanescens''''', commonly known as the '''bluing bolete''' or the '''cornflower bolete''', is a species of [[bolete]] fungus in the family [[Gyroporaceae]]. First described from France in 1788, the species is found in Eurasia, Australia, and eastern North America, where it grows on the ground in [[conifer]]ous and [[mixed forest]]s.

The yellowish to [[buff (color)|buff]] cap surface is fibrous and roughened, and reaches up to {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. The thick [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], roughly the same color as the cap or lighter, is hollowed out into chambers. All parts of the mushroom turn an intense blue color within a few moments of bruising or cutting. The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], despite its hard stem. A less common [[variety (botany)|variety]] occurs where the color change is to deep violet rather than blue. The bluing reaction results from the [[redox reaction|enzymatic oxidation]] of a chemical called [[gyrocyanin]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described scientifically by French botanist [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard]] in his 1788 ''Herbier de la France''.<ref name="Bulliard 1788"/> Later [[synonym (biology)|synonyms]] include ''Boletus constrictus'' by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801,<ref name="Persoon 1801"/> ''Leccinum constrictum'' by [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] in 1821,<ref name="Gray 1821"/> ''Suillus cyanescens'' by [[Petter Karsten]] in 1882,<ref name="Karsten 1882"/> and ''Leucoconius cyanescens'' by [[Günther Beck von Mannagetta und Lerchenau]] in 1923.<ref name="Beck 1923"/> The variety ''violaceotinctus'' was described by [[Roy Watling]] in 1969 from collections made in [[Michigan]], USA.<ref name="Watling 1969"/>

The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] κύανoς, meaning "dark blue",<ref name="Rea 1922"/> while the varietal epithet ''violaceotinctus'' means "having a violet tinge".<ref name="Smith 1980"/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the bluing bolete<ref name="Bessette 2001"/> or the cornflower bolete.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/>

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''G.&nbsp;cyanescens'' is initially convex, but flattens out in maturity, sometimes becoming shallowly depressed;<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> it reaches a diameter of {{convert|4–12|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=308}}</ref> The cap is dry, and ranges in color from [[buff (color)|buff]] to yellowish to pale olive, occasionally with darker streaks of color.<ref name="Bessette 2001"/> Its surface is uneven, sometimes with wrinkles and pits.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> The cap margin is initially curved inward, and sometimes splits in maturity.<ref name=Phillips2005/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish to pale yellow, and has a brittle texture. On the underside of the cap, the pore surface is white to yellowish, sometimes with olive or tan tinges. There are roughly two circular pores per millimeter, and the tubes that comprise the pores are {{convert|5–10|mm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} deep, but depressed around the top of the stem. Injury to the pores will cause them to stain first greenish yellow, then greenish blue or blue.<ref name="Bessette 2001"/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4–12|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long by {{convert|1–2.5|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick,<ref name="audu" /> and is either roughly equal in width throughout its length, or has a basal or middle swelling. The stem tissue is hard and brittle; it is initially stuffed with a soft pith that develops cavities, or becomes entirely hollow in maturity. Roughly the same color as the cap or lighter, the stem surface is dry and lacks [[wikt:reticulation|reticulations]]. It is initially covered in coarse hairs that tend to disappear in maturity to leave a relatively smooth surface. All parts of the fruit body stain blue when cut or injured. The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''G.&nbsp;cyanescens'' var. ''violaceotinctus'' is nearly identical in appearance, but stains dark [[lilac (color)|lilac]] to [[indigo]] when bruised.<ref name="Bessette 2001"/> The odor and taste of the fruit bodies is indistinct.<ref name="urlKuo"/>

The color of the [[spore print]] is pale yellow.<ref name="audu" /> The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are ellipsoid, smooth, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and have dimensions of 8–10 by 5–6&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Bessette 2001"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club shaped, two- to four-spored, and measure 24–30 by 8–10&nbsp;μm. Pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the inner walls of the tubes) are light yellow brown in color, club shaped, infrequent, and measure 25–38 by 5.5-7.2&nbsp;μm; the cheilocystidia (found on the tube edge) are colorless, numerous, and measure 32–47 by 7–10&nbsp;μm. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the [[hypha]]e.<ref name="Zhishu 1993"/>

===Chemistry===


The identity of the chemical causing bluing upon tissue injury was reported in 1973.<ref name="Besl 1973"/> The molecule, gyrocyanin, is a highly oxidized ''bis''-aryl-substituted hydroxy-[[cyclopentenone]] that develops a blue color when [[oxidized]]. In contrast, the bluing of other [[bolete]]s has been attributed to the oxidation of [[variegatic acid|variegatic]] or [[xerocomic acid]].<ref name="Nelson 2010"/> Gyrocyanin is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] from intermediates supplied by the [[Shikimic acid#Shikimate pathway|shikimate pathway]], a [[metabolic pathway|metabolic route]] used by fungi for the synthesis of [[aromatic amino acids]].<ref name="Steglich 1975"/>

===Similar species===
Although there are a few lookalike species with similar overall appearance, in the field, ''Gyroporus cyanescens'' is typically readily recognized by its characteristic straw-yellow color and nearly instantaneous dark blue bruising. ''[[Gyroporus phaeocyanescens|G.&nbsp;phaeocyanescens]]'' is smaller, with a dull brownish-yellow cap. Although its flesh has a bluing reaction to injury, its yellow pore surface does not. It has larger spores, measuring 9–15 by 5–7&nbsp;μm. ''[[Gyroporus umbrinosquamosus|G.&nbsp;umbrinosquamosus]]'', found along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States]], is similar in appearance, but lacks the bluing reaction.<ref name="Bessette 2001"/> Newly described from China in 2003, ''[[Gyroporus brunneofloccosus|G.&nbsp;brunneofloccosus]]'' closely resembles ''G.&nbsp;cyanescens'', and was frequently confused with that species. It has a smaller fruit body, with a brownish cap up to {{convert|8|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} in diameter. Its staining reaction involves a change from light [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]] to dark turquoise or dark blue. Its spores are 5–8.5 by 4–5.3&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Li 2003"/> ''[[Suillus tomentosus]]'' has brownish pores that undergo a slower blue staining reaction.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> If the fruit bodies are not uprooted and only the top of the cap is examined, ''G.&nbsp;cyanescens'' can be confused with young ''[[Russula fellea]]'' mushrooms.<ref name="Mattock 1999"/>

''[[Caloboletus marshii]]'' stains light blue but not at the base of the stem.<ref name="audu" />

==Ecology and distribution==
''Gyroporus cyanescens'' is an [[ectomycorrhiza]]l species that has a broad [[host (biology)|host]] range.<ref name="Smith 2008"/> Fruit bodies of ''G.&nbsp;cyanescens'' grow singly or scattered on the ground in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[mixed forest]]s. Often found in association with [[birch]] and [[Populus|poplar]], the fungus tends to prefer sandy soil,<ref name="Bessette 2001"/> and also frequents road banks and woodland edges.<ref name="Roody 2003"/> Fruiting occurs in summer and early autumn.<ref name="Miller 2006"/> Fruit bodies can be [[parasitism|parasitized]] by the mold ''[[Sepedonium ampullosporum]]''.<ref name="Ammer 1997"/>  Infection results in [[necrosis]] of the mushroom tissue, and a yellow color caused by the formation of large amounts of [[pigment]]ed aleurioconidia (single-celled [[conidia]] produced by extrusion from the [[conidiophore]]s).<ref name="Neuhof 2007"/>

''Gyroporus cyanescens'' is found in Europe, Asia, Australia, and North America (July–September).<ref name="audu" /> In China, it is known from [[Guangdong]] and [[Yunnan]].<ref name="Zhishu 1993"/> The fungus appears in [[eucalypt]] woodland in Australia.<ref name="Hilton 1972"/> In North America, it is widespread east of the [[Rocky Mountains]].<ref name="urlKuo"/> The geographical distribution ranges from eastern Canada to [[Florida]], and west to [[Minnesota]],<ref name="Bessette 2001"/> although it has been occasionally reported from the [[Pacific Northwest]],<ref name="Kuo 2007"/> and one collection has been made in the [[Sky island|Sky Islands]] of southern [[Arizona]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=May |first1=Christopher |title=iNaturalist Observation #16410818 |url=https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/16410818 |website=iNaturalist |date=11 September 2018 |access-date=8 April 2024}}</ref> ''G.&nbsp;cyanescens'' var. '' violaceotinctus'' has been reported from Japan.<ref name="Nagasawa 2001"/>

 (seen in left vertical line) that quickly changes to blue.]]

== Uses ==
''Gyroporus cyanescens'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]], and considered "choice" by several sources.<ref name="Bessette 1992"/><ref name="Miller 2006"/><ref name="Kuo 2007"/> The fruit bodies, even if mature, are typically free of insect larvae. Specimens collected in sandy soil, however, are difficult to clean,<ref name="Smith 1980"/> but cleaning may be facilitated by washing the fruit bodies in a bowl of water so that the sand sinks to the bottom. The blue color largely disappears after two minutes of [[sautéing]]. Cooked mushrooms have a meaty texture, and mild nutty flavor that is enhanced if fried to crispness. Drying the mushrooms strengthens the taste.<ref name="Kuo 2007"/>

The variety ''violaceotinctus'' is used in [[mushroom dye]]ing, and produces a light yellow, beige, gold, or brownish-orange color depending on the [[mordant]] used.<ref name="Bessette 2001b"/>
