'''Candy cap''' and '''curry milkcap''' are [[common name]]s for two closely related species of ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'': '''''L.&nbsp;camphoratus''''' and '''''L.&nbsp;rubidus'''''. Additionally, [[Lactarius rufulus|''L.&nbsp;rufulus'']] is termed the southern candy cap. Many similar species are known.

Candy caps are valued for their highly aromatic qualities and are used as a flavoring.

== Taxonomy ==
The candy caps have been placed in various infrageneric groups of ''Lactarius'' depending on the author. Bon<ref name="bon">Bon M. 1983. Notes sur la systématique du genre ''Lactarius''. ''Documents Mycologiques'' 13(50): 15–26.</ref> defined the candy caps and allies as making up the subsection ''Camphoratini'' of the section ''Olentes''. Subsection ''Camphoratini'' is defined by their similarity in color, odor (with the exception of ''L.&nbsp;rostratus''), and by the presence of [[cystidia|macrocystidia]] on their [[hymenium]]. (The other subsection of ''Olentes'', ''Serifluini'', is also aromatic, but have very different aromas from the ''Camphoratini'' and are entirely lacking in cystidia.)<ref name="heilmann">Heilmann-Clausen J, Verbeken A, Vesterholt J. 1998. ''The Genus'' Lactarius. (Fungi of Northern Europe, Volume 2.) Mundelstrup, DK: Danish Mycological Society. {{ISBN|87-983581-4-6}}.</ref>

Bon<ref name="bon" /> and later European authors treated all species that were aromatic and had at least a partially epithelial [[pileipellis]] as section ''Olentes'', whereas Hesler and Smith<ref name="hesler">
Hesler LR, Smith AH. 1979. ''North American Species of'' Lactarius. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|0-472-08440-2}}.</ref> and later North American authors<ref name="methven">Methven AS. 1997. ''The Agaricales of California 10. Russulales II:'' Lactarius. Eureka, CA: Mad River Press. {{ISBN|0-916422-85-2}}.</ref> treat all species with such a pileipellis (both aromatic and non-aromatic) as the section ''Thojogali''. However, a thorough [[molecular phylogenetic]] investigation of ''Lactarius'' has yet to be published, and older classification systems of ''Lactarius'' are generally not regarded as natural.<ref name="heilmann" />

== Description ==


Candy caps are small to medium-size mushrooms, with a [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] ranging from {{Convert|2–7|cm|frac=4}} in diameter,<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Davis |first1=R. Michael |title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America |last2=Sommer |first2=Robert |last3=Menge |first3=John A. |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-520-95360-4 |location=Berkeley |pages=98–99 |oclc=797915861 }}</ref> and colored orange-brown to reddish-brown.<ref name="Arora2nd">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/80/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=80–82 |orig-date=1979 }}</ref> The pileus shape ranges from broadly convex in young specimens to plane to slightly depressed in older ones; [[lamella (mycology)|lamella]]e are [[wikt:attached|attached]] to [[wiktionary:decurrent|subdecurrent]]. The stipe is {{cvt|3-6|cm|frac=4}} long.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=182 }}</ref>

The entire [[fruiting body]] can be either firm<ref name="audu" /> or fragile and brittle. Like all members of ''Lactarius'', the fruiting body exudes a latex when broken, which in these species is whitish and watery in appearance, and is often compared to [[whey]] or nonfat milk. The latex may have little flavor or may be slightly sweet, but should never taste bitter or acrid. These species are particularly distinguishable by their scent, which has been variously compared to [[maple syrup]], [[camphor]], [[curry]], [[fenugreek]], burnt sugar, [[Malt-O-Meal]], or ''[[Maggi|Maggi-Würze]]''. This scent may be quite faint in fresh specimens, but typically becomes quite strong when the fruiting body is dried.

Microscopically, they share features typical of ''Lactarius'', including round to slightly ovular [[Basidiospore|spores]] with distinct [[amyloid]] ornamentation and [[sphaerocyst]]s that are abundant in the pileus and stipe [[trama (mycology)|trama]], but infrequent in the [[lamellar trama]].<ref>Largent DL, Baroni TJ. 1988. ''How to Identify Mushrooms to Genus VI: Modern Genera''. Arcata, CA: Mad River Press. {{ISBN|0-916422-76-3}}. p 73–74.</ref>

=== Chemistry ===


The chemical responsible for the distinct odor of the candy cap was isolated in 2012 by [[chemical ecologist]] and [[natural product]] [[chemist]] William Wood of [[Humboldt State University]], from collections of ''Lactarius rubidus''. The odoriferous compound found in the fresh tissue and latex of the mushroom was found to be [[quabalactone]] III, an aromatic [[lactone]]. When the tissue and latex is dried, quabalactone III is [[hydrolyzed]] into [[sotolon]], an even more powerfully aromatic compound, and one of the main compounds responsible for the aroma of [[maple syrup]], as well as that of [[curry]].<ref name="wood2012">Wood WF, Brandes JA, Foy BD, Morgan CG, Mann TD, DeShazer DA. 2012. The maple syrup odour of the "candy cap" mushroom, ''Lactarius fragilis'' var. ''rubidus''. Biochemical Systematics and Ecology 43:51-53. {{doi|10.1016/j.bse.2012.02.027}}.</ref>

The question of what compound was responsible for the odor of candy cap had been under investigation by Wood and various students for a period of 27 years, when a mycology student in a class he was teaching asked what compound was responsible for the mushroom's odor, triggering investigation into the question. Isolation of the compound remained elusive, until [[solid-phase microextraction]] was used to extract the volatile compounds, which were then analyzed using [[gas chromatography–mass spectrometry]].<ref name="wood2012" /><ref>Humboldt State University. 2012. Student question about mushroom's maple syrup odor takes 27 years to answer. ''Humboldt State Now'' (website). May 4, 2012.</ref>

Earlier investigation of the aromatic compounds of ''L.&nbsp;helvus'' by Rapor, et al. had also yielded sotolon (among a large number of other aromatic compounds), which was identified as giving this species its distinct fenugreek odor. Other important volatile compounds identified included [[decanoic acid]] and [[2-methylbutyric acid]].<ref>Rapior S, Fons F, Bessiere J-M. 2000. The fenugreek odor of ''Lactarius helvus''. ''Mycologia'' 92(2): 305–308. {{doi|10.2307/3761565}}.</ref>

Analysis of ''Lactarius camphoratus'' has shown that it contains 12-hydroxycaryophyllene-4,5-oxide, a [[caryophyllene]] compound. However, this was not identified as an aromatic component of this mushroom.<ref>Daniewski WM, Grieco PA, Huffman JC, Rymkiewicz A, Wawrzun, A. 1981. Isolation of 12-hydroxycaryophyllene-4,5-oxide, a sesquiterpene from ''Lactarius camphoratus''. ''Phytochemistry''. 20(12):2733–4. {{doi|10.1016/0031-9422(81)85276-4}}.</ref>

=== Identification ===

It is possible to mistake other distasteful or toxic species of mushrooms for candy caps or mistakenly include such species in a larger collection of candy caps. Those inexperienced with mushroom identification may mistake any number of "[[little brown mushroom]]s" (LBMs) for candy caps, including the [[deadly galerina]] (''Galerina marginata'' and allies), which can occur in the same habitat. Candy caps can be distinguished from non-''Lactarius'' species by their brittle stipe, while most other LBMs have a more flexible stipe. It is therefore recommended that candy caps be gathered by hand, breaking the fragile stipe in one's fingers. By this method, LBMs with a cartilaginous stipe will easily be distinguished.<ref name="campbell">Campbell D. 2004. [http://www.mssf.org/mnews/0403mn.pdf The candy cap complex.] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116043402/http://mssf.org/mnews/0403mn.pdf#|date=November 16, 2006}} ''[[Mycological Society of San Francisco|Mycena News]]'' 55(3):3–4. (scroll down)</ref>

Candy caps may also be confused with any of a large number of small, similarly colored species of ''Lactarius'' that may be distasteful to downright toxic depending on the species and the number consumed.

Candy caps may be distinguished from other ''Lactarius'' by the following characteristics:

* Odor: Candy caps have a distinctive odor (described above) that should not be present in other species of ''Lactarius''. However, that other species of ''Lactarius'' may have different, but also distinctive, odors. Fresh candy caps (especially ''L.&nbsp;rubidus'') may also not have a noticeable odor, limiting the utility of this characteristic. A sweet odor is much more evident after briefly singeing the flesh of a candy cap with a match or lighter, which can be useful for identification.<ref>Winkler, Daniel. 2023. Fruits of the Forest: A Field Guide to Pacific Northwest Edible Mushrooms. Seattle, Washington: Skipstone.</ref>

* Taste: The flesh and latex of candy caps should always be mild-tasting to somewhat sweet, lacking any hint of bitterness or acridity. Note, however, that there are some species of ''Lactarius'', such as ''L.&nbsp;luculentus'', where the bitterness is subtle and also may not be noticeable for a minute or so after tasting.
* Latex: The latex of candy caps appears thin and whey-like, like milk that has been mixed with water. This latex does not change color nor does it discolor the flesh of the mushroom. Other species of ''Lactarius'' have a distinctly white or colored latex, which in some species discolors the flesh of the mushroom.
* Pileus: Candy caps never have a [[wikt:zonate|zonate]] pattern of coloration on the surface of the pileus, nor is the pileus ever even slightly [[wikt:viscid|viscid]].

=== Similar species ===
A number of species of ''Lactarius'' are distinctly aromatic, though only some of these species are thought to be closely related to the candy cap group.

The subsection ''Camphoratini'' includes ''[[Lactarius rostratus]]'', a species found in northern Europe, though quite rare.<ref name="heilmann" /> Unlike other members of subsection ''Camphoratini'', ''L.&nbsp;rostratus'' has an unpleasant (even nauseating) smell, described as resembling [[ivy]]. ''Lactarius cremor'' is a name sometimes used for mushrooms in this group, however, Heilmann-Clausen, et al.<ref name="heilmann" /> consider this name to be [[nomen dubium]], referring variously to ''Lactarius rostratus'', ''[[Lactarius serifluus|L.&nbsp;serifluus]]'', or ''[[Lactarius fulvissimus|L.&nbsp;fulvissimus]]'' depending on the author's concept of ''L.&nbsp;cremor''. ''[[Lactarius mukteswaricus]]'' and ''[[Lactarius verbekenae|L.&nbsp;verbekenae]]'', two species described from the [[Kumaon Division|Kumaon]] area of the Indian [[Himalaya]] in 2004, are reported to be very closely related to ''L.&nbsp;camphoratus'', including in odor.<ref>Das K, Sharma, JR, Montoya L. 2004.

''[[Lactarius rufulus]]'' is reported by one source as being a "candy cap" species and having a similar odor to the other candy caps,<ref name="campbell" /> though earlier monographs do not report such an aroma and describe the flavor as subacrid.

''[[Lactarius helvus]]'' and ''[[Lactarius aquifluus|L. aquifluus]]'', found in Europe and North America, respectively, are also strongly aromatic and similar to candy caps, the former having the odor of fenugreek. ''Lactarius helvus'' is known to be mildly toxic, causing gastrointestinal upset. The edibility of ''L.&nbsp;aquifluus'' is unknown, but as it is a close relative of ''L.&nbsp;helvus'', it is suspected of being toxic.<ref>Phillips R. 2006.

==Distribution and habitat==
Near the West Coast of North America, candy caps can be found from December through March.<ref name="audu" />

==Ecology==
Like other species of ''Lactarius'', candy caps are generally thought to be [[ectomycorrhizal|ectotrophic]], with ''L.&nbsp;camphoratus'' having been identified in ectomycorrhizal root tips. However, unusually for a mycorrhizal species, ''L.&nbsp;rubidus'' is also commonly observed growing directly on decaying conifer wood.<ref name="methven" /> All candy cap species seem to be associated with a range of tree species.

==Uses==
Candy caps are not typically consumed as a vegetable the way most other edible mushrooms are consumed. Because of the strongly aromatic quality of these mushrooms, they are instead used primarily as a  [[flavoring]], much the way [[vanilla]], [[saffron]], or [[Tuber (genus)|truffles]] are used. They impart a flavor and aroma to foods that has been compared to maple syrup or curry,<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |orig-year=2005 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=125 }}</ref> but with a much stronger aroma than either of these seasonings. Candy caps are unique among edible mushrooms in that they are often used in sweet and dessert foods, such as [[cookies]] and [[ice cream]].<ref name="sfchronicle" /> They are also sometimes used to flavor savory dishes that are traditionally prepared with sweet accompaniments, such as pork, and are also sometimes used in place of curry seasoning.

They are usually used in dried form, as the characteristic aroma intensifies greatly upon drying. To use them as a flavoring, the dried mushrooms are either powdered or they are infused into one of the liquid ingredients used in the dish, for example, being steeped in hot milk, much the same way whole vanilla beans are.

As a result of these culinary properties, candy caps are highly sought after by many chefs. ''Lactarius rubidus'' is commercially gathered and sold in California<ref name=sfchronicle>Treviño L. 2004 Jan 9.
