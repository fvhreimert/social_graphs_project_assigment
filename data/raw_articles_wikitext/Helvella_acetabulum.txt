'''''Helvella acetabulum''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Helvellaceae]], order [[Pezizales]]. This relatively large cup-shaped fungus is characterized by a tan [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]] with prominent branching ribs resembling a cabbage leaf; for this reason it is [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''cabbage leaf Helvella'''. Other colloquial names include the '''vinegar cup''' and the '''brown ribbed elfin cup'''.

The fruit bodies reaches dimensions of {{convert|8|cm|frac=2}} by {{convert|4|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} tall. It is found in Eurasia and North America, where it grows in sandy soils, under both [[conifer]]ous and [[deciduous]] trees.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was first named as ''Peziza acetabulum'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1753 ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.<ref name="Linnaeus1753" /> It was given its current name by French mycologist [[Lucien Quélet]] in 1874 after having been placed in various ''Peziza'' [[segregate taxon|segregates]]: [[Joachim Christian Timm]] placed it in ''[[Octospora]]'' (1788), [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] in ''Macroscyphus'' (1821), and [[Karl Wilhelm Gottlieb Leopold Fuckel|Leopold Fuckel]] in ''Acetabula'' (1870). The trend continued, with [[Claude Casimir Gillet]] with placing it in ''[[Aleuria]]'' in 1879, and [[Otto Kuntze]] in his new ''Paxina'' (of which it would later be designated type species) in 1891.<ref name="urlFungorum: Helvella acetabulum" />

Described independently as ''Peziza sulcata'' by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801, it was placed under that name in both ''Paxina'' and ''Acetabula''—alongside its precursor as both taxa were still considered separate at the time.<ref name="urlFungorum: Helvella acetabulum" /> Finally, [[Frederic Clements]] renamed ''Acetabula'' as ''Phleboscyphus'' in 1903 and improperly reused Fuckel's name as the [[basionym]] of his ''Phleboscyphus vulgaris''.<!--Note: Boudier's barlae names listed in Species Fungorum are placed with H. arcto-alpina, not this species--><ref>{{cite journal |last=Clements |first=Frederic E. |year=1903 |title=Nova Ascomycetum Genera Speciesque |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/246255 |journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club |language=Latin |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=83–94 |doi=10.2307/2478878 |jstor=2478878 |hdl-access=free |hdl=2027/hvd.32044106398282}}</ref>

=== Etymology ===
The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''acetabulum'' means "little vinegar cup", and was the [[Latin]] word for a small vessel used for storing [[vinegar]] (see [[acetabulum (cup)|acetabulum]]). [[Common name]]s include the "cabbage leaf Helvella",<ref name="Tylutki1979" /> the "vinegar cup",<ref name="McKnight1987" /> the "ribbed-stalk cup",<ref name="Bessette2007" /> and the "brown ribbed elfin cup".<ref name="Arora1986" />

==Description==

''Helvella acetabulum'' has a deeply cup-shaped [[ascocarp (fungus)|fruit body]] (technically an [[apothecium]]) that is up to {{convert|8|cm|1|abbr=off|frac=2}} in diameter, and {{convert|4|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} deep.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=27}}</ref> The cream-colored [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is typically {{convert|1 to 6|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} tall by {{convert|1 to 3|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick,<ref name="McKnight1987" /> with ribs extending almost to the top of the fruit body.<ref name="Orr1979" /> The fruit body's exterior surface is cream-colored towards the stem and may feel subtly grainy near the margin.<ref name=":0" /> The inner [[spore]]-bearing surface, the [[hymenium]], is brownish<ref name=":0" /> and possibly smooth or slightly wavy. The mushroom's odor and taste are not distinctive.<ref name=Jordan2004/>

The spores are smooth, elliptical, translucent ([[hyaline]]), and contain a single central oil droplet; they have dimensions of 18–20 by 12–14&nbsp;[[μm]]. The spore-bearing cells, the [[ascus|asci]], are 350–400 by 15–20&nbsp;μm, are [[wikt:operculate|operculate]]—meaning they have an apical "lid" that releases the spores. The tips of the asci are [[inamyloid]], so they do not adsorb [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]].<ref name=Jordan2004/> The [[paraphyses]] are club-shaped, and have a pale brown color, with tips that are up to 10&nbsp;μm thick.<ref name=Tylutki1979/>

===Similar species===

''[[Helvella queletii]]'' has a roughly similar form and appearance, but the ribbing in that species does not extend up the margin as does ''H.&nbsp;acetabulum''.<ref name=Tylutki1979/> ''H.&nbsp;griseoalba'' has ribs that extend halfway up the sides of the fruit body, but the color of the cup is pale to dark gray rather than cream.<ref name=Bessette2007/> The ribs of ''[[Helvella solitaria|H.&nbsp;solitaria]]'' and ''[[Dissingia leucomelaena]]'' barely touch the cap.<ref name=":0" /> ''[[Helvella costifera|H.&nbsp;costifera]]'' produces similar fruit bodies but has a grayish to grayish-brown hymenium; like ''H.&nbsp;acetabulum'', it has ribs that extend to most of the outside of the fruit body. There are sometimes intermediate forms between the two species, making them difficult to distinguish.<ref name=Calonge1990/>

''H.&nbsp;robusta'' is also similar to ''H.&nbsp;acetabulum'', but has a lighter-colored hymenium, a robust stem, and the margin of the fruit body is often bent over the stem at maturity. In contrast, ''H.&nbsp;acetabulum'' never has the edge of the fruit body bent over the stem, and the stem is "indistinct or prominent, but never robust".<ref name="Abbott1988" /> Other similar species include ''[[Helvella leucomelaena|H.&nbsp;leucomelaena]]''<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=395–396|oclc=797915861}}</ref> and ''[[Discina perlata|Gyromitra perlata]]''.<ref name=":0" />

==Distribution and habitat==

This fungus is widespread in North America and Europe.<ref name=Orr1979/> In North America, the distribution extends north to [[Alberta, Canada]].<ref name=Abbott1988/> In Mexico, it has been collected from [[State of Mexico]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Guerrero]], and [[Tlaxcala]].<ref name=ViteGarin2006/> It is also found in Israel,<ref name=Barseghyan2008/> [[Jordan]],<ref name=Natour2006/> Turkey,<ref name=Gezer2008/> Iran <ref name="Asef 2010"/> China ([[Xinjiang]])<ref name=Zhuang2004/> and Japan.<ref name=Nagao2002/>

The fruit bodies grows solitary, scattered, or clustered together on soil in both [[conifer]]ous and [[deciduous]] woods, typically in spring and summer.<ref name=McKnight1987/> A preference for growing in association with [[coast live oak]] (''Quercus agrifolia'') has been noted for Californian populations.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Helvella acetabulum"/>

==Potential toxicity==
The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the fruit bodies is often listed as unknown,<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Helvella acetabulum" /><ref name="Metzler1992" /> but consumption of this fungus is not recommended as similar species in the family [[Helvellaceae]] contain varying levels of [[monomethylhydrazine]] (MMH).<ref name="McClintock1986" /> Although MMH can be removed by boiling in a well-ventilated area, consumption of any MMH-producing mushroom is not advisable (as with ''[[Gyromitra esculenta|G.&nbsp;esculenta]]''). Roger Phillips lists the species as [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |publisher=Firefly Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |location=Buffalo, NY |page=367}}</ref>
