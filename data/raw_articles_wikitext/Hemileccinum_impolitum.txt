'''''Hemileccinum impolitum''''' is a [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] of the family [[Boletaceae]], native to [[Europe]]. It is commonly referred to as the '''iodine bolete''', because its fruit bodies tend to emit an [[iodine]]-like odour when cut, more detectable in the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] base or overripe specimens.

Like other members of the family, ''H. impolitum'' has tubes and pores instead of [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] in the [[hymenium|hymenial]] surface of its fruit bodies. It is widely distributed in temperate and southern [[Europe]], where it grows in [[mycorrhizal]] [[symbiosis]] with [[broad-leaved]] trees, particularly oak (''[[Quercus]]'').

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The iodine bolete was first described by [[Elias Magnus Fries]], an eminent mycologist of the 19th century, who placed the fungus in genus ''[[Boletus]]''.<ref>Fries, E. (1838). Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici. :1-610</ref> The [[Latin]] epithet ''impolitum'' (meaning "rough"), likely refers to the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the species, which is initially felty and covered in a finely filamentous coating when viewed under a [[magnifying glass]]. The species' taxonomic position had long remained uncertain and various authors had placed it in different genera in the past, including the now abandoned genera ''Tubiporus''<ref>Karsten PA. (1882). Rysslands, Finlans och den Skandinaviska halföns Hattsvampar. Sednare Delen: Pip-, Tagg-, Hud-, Klubb- och Gelésvampar. Bidrag till Kännedom av Finlands Natur och Folk. 37: 1–257</ref> and ''Versipellis''.<ref>Quélet L. (1886). Enchir. fung. (Paris): 158</ref>

Based on preliminary analysis of the [[28S ribosomal RNA]] locus, mycologists Manfred Binder and Halmut Besl placed the species in ''[[Xerocomus]]'' in 2000.<ref name="BINDER & BESL 2000"/> However, in 2008 Josef Šutara transferred the fungus to the new genus ''[[Hemileccinum]]'', based on its distinctive morphology.<ref name="Šutara 2008"/> More elaborate [[phylogenetic]] studies by Wu and colleagues in 2014, confirmed that the iodine bolete does not belong in ''[[Boletus]]'', ''[[Xerocomus]]'' or ''[[Leccinum]]'', since collections identified as this species occupied a distinct phylogenetic [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]] within the subfamily of Xerocomoideae, closely related to ''[[Corneroboletus]]''.<ref name="Wu 2014"/> Subsequent contributions by R. Halling and colleagues,<ref name="Halling 2015"/> and M. Loizides and colleagues,<ref name="Loizides 2019"/> have since confirmed the [[monophyly]] of the genus, which presently includes just two [[Europe]]an species: ''H. impolitum'' and ''H. depilatum''.

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] diameter usually ranges between {{convert|5|and|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, but can reach {{convert|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. It is at first hemispherical, gradually becoming convex as the fungus expands and finally flat in fully mature specimens, sometimes with a slightly uplifted margin. The colour ranges from light tan, pale brown, chestnut-brown, grey, ochraceous-brown, greyish-brown or olivaceous-brown and the cap of young fruit bodies is initially covered in a velvety, finely filamentous silvery-grey coating that disappears in age.<ref name="Courtecuisse 1995"/><ref name="Galli 2007"/>

The [[cap cuticle]] turns violet with a drop of [[ammonium hydroxide]].<ref name="Šutara 2008"/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is cylindrical, clavate or ventricose, {{convert|5|to|15|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|2|to|6|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, cream to pale yellow, but typically lemon-yellow at the apex and usually narrowing at the base. It has no reticulation (net), but is covered in tiny pustules (scabrosities) below the apex, sometimes browning with age.<ref name="Ladurner 2003"/><ref name="Šutara 2008"/>

The tubes are pale yellow to lemon-yellow and usually do not discolour when cut, but may rarely stain faintly greenish-brown. The pores are small and rounded, lemon-yellow to chrome-yellow, not discolouring or rarely staining greenish-brown where handled or injured. The flesh is thick, soft, pale yellow to whitish, usually remaining the same colour when cut, or rarely becoming faintly pinkish-brown above the tubes and at the stem base. It has a sour smell somewhat reminiscent of iodine, more pronounced at the stem base.<ref name=Phillips06/><ref name="Ladurner 2003"/>

The [[spore print]] is olivaceous-brown.<ref name=H&R1992/>

The spores are fusiform (spindle-shaped) or fusiform-ellipsoid, measuring 10–16 × 4–6 μm.<ref name="Breitenbach 1991"/> Although under an [[optical microscope]] they appear perfectly smooth, when viewed with a [[scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscope (SEM)]] fine warts and tiny “pin-pricks” are visible on their surface.<ref name="Wu 2014"/> The [[Pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a trichodermium, composed of cylindrical smooth hyphae with clavate terminal cells that later collapse in mature specimens.<ref name="Šutara 2008"/>

===Similar species===
*''Hemileccinum depilatum'' is the sister-species of ''H. impolitum'' and morphologically very similar, differing by its wrinkled or "hammered" cap surface, and its association hornbeam (''[[Carpinus]]'') or hop-hornbeam (''[[Ostrya]]''). Microscopically it is distinguished by the structure of its cap cuticle, which is a palisadoderm composed of spherical and shortly cylindrical cells.
*''[[Leccinellum lepidum]]'' can also look very similar, but typically has a viscid cap with a wrinkled or "hammered" surface '''not''' turning violet with a drop of aqueous ammonia, while its flesh slowly turns violaceous-grey and finally greyish-black when exposed to the air. Microscopically it has longer spores, often reaching 20 μm in length.
*''[[Xerocomus subtomentosus]]'' lacks scabrosities on the stem surface, while its pores are larger, angular and stain bluish when bruised. When longitudinally cut, its flesh is pinkish-brown in the lower part of the stem and sometimes discolours faintly bluish in the cap.

==Distribution and habitat==

''Hemileccinum impolitum'' is ecologically versatile, forming [[ectomycorrhizal]] associations with several species of oak (''[[Quercus]]''), but occasionally also with beech (''[[Fagus (plant)|Fagus]]'') and chestnut (''[[Castanea (plant)|Castanea]]''). It does not appear to be substrate-specific and has been reported from both [[calcareous]] and acidic soil.<ref name="Ladurner 2003"/><ref name="Galli 2007"/><ref name="Loizides 2019"/> In the [[United Kingdom]], it is occasionally found in [[southern England]], although finds in other parts of the country have also been reported.<ref name="Watling 2005"/><ref name="Kibby 2016"/>

[[Phylogenetics|Molecular phylogenetic]] testing has so far verified its presence in [[Estonia]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and the [[Mediterranean]] islands of [[Cyprus]] and [[Sardinia]].<ref name="Halling 2015"/><ref name="Loizides 2019"/>

==Edibility==
The iodine bolete is described as [[edible mushroom|edible]] by some authors,<ref name="Galli 2007"/><ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |url=https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil |url-access=registration |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mushroomsotherfu0000phil/page/266 266]}}</ref> and inedible by others,<ref name="Breitenbach 1991"/> probably because of the peculiar odour of this species. However, it is hardly ever found in large numbers, therefore care and discretion should be exercised when intending to eat this mushroom.
