'''''Pholiota flammans''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''yellow pholiota''', the '''flaming Pholiota''', or the '''flame scalecap''', is a [[basidiomycete]] [[agaric]] mushroom of the genus ''[[Pholiota]]''. Its [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]] is golden-yellow in color throughout, while its [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] and [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] are covered in sharp scales. As it is a [[saprobic]] fungus, the fruit bodies typically appear in clusters on the [[tree stump|stump]]s of dead [[conifer]]ous trees. ''P.&nbsp;flammans'' is distributed throughout Europe, North America, and Asia in [[Taiga|boreal]] and [[temperate]] regions. Its [[edible mushroom|edibility]] has not been clarified.

In the organization of [[Rolf Singer]], the species is placed in subgenus ''Pholiota'', section ''Adiposae'', [[wikt:stirp|stirps]] ''Subflammans''—a grouping of closely related species that also includes ''P.&nbsp;subflammans'' and ''P.&nbsp;digilioi''.

==Description==


''Pholiota flammans'' often has a striking appearance. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially round, then convex and finally flattening with age. Its surface is bright yellow to orange, and covered with triangular scales ([[wiktionary:squamule|squamules]]) arranged in concentric rings. The cap surface is dry, matt and felt-like, and in wet conditions may lose scales. The cap margin remain curved slightly inwards. The yellow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded together, attached to the stem, and have a notch where the gill attaches to the stem.<ref name=Bessette1997/> A bright yellow [[partial veil]] extending from the cap edge to the edge is present in immature species. As the cap expands and flattens with age, the partial veil tears, leaving a faint [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] around the stem. The cylindrical straight or curved [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is itself covered in yellow squamules below the ring. The base of the stem, typically more orange in color than the upper portion,<ref name=Bessette1997/> is firmly attached to the dead wood from which the fungus arises. The section of stem above the ring bears little or no protuberances. The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm, full, yellow and does not change color when bruised or injured.

The dimensions of the fruit body are as follows: cap diameter up to {{convert|8|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}}, stem up to {{convert|12|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} tall and between {{convert|0.4 to 1|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} cm thick.<ref name=Jordan2004>{{cite book |author=Jordan M|title=The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |year=2004 |page=261 |isbn=0-7112-2378-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFMfytLn3bEC&q=Pholiota+flammans&pg=PA261|access-date=2009-11-01}}</ref>
As the fruit body matures, the gills darken to cinnamon brown following [[Basidiospore|spore]] release. The [[spore print]] is brown to rust.

===Microscopic features===
Under a [[light microscope]], the spores are seen to be smooth, elliptical to oblong in shape, with dimensions of 3–5 by 2–3&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name=Arora1986>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/391/mode/2up |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |year=1986 |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=391–92}}</ref> The [[basidia]] (the spore-bearing cells) are 4-spored, and have a narrow club-shape with dimension of 18–22 by 3.5–4.5&nbsp;μm.

===Similar species===


Other members of the genus ''[[Pholiota]]'' can appear similar, especially ''[[Pholiota squarrosa]]'' which commonly forms large tufts at the base of [[deciduous]] as well as [[conifer]]ous trees. ''P.&nbsp;squarrosa'' tends to be a less intense yellow color than ''P.&nbsp;flammans''. ''[[Pholiota adiposa|P.&nbsp;adiposa]]'' is also similar, but prefers to grow on dead [[hardwood]]s;<ref name=Arora1986/> unlike ''P.&nbsp;flammans'', it has gelatinous scales on the stem as well as the cap.<ref name=McKnight1987/> ''[[Pholiota aurivella|P.&nbsp;aurivella]]'' is larger and less bright than ''P.&nbsp;flammans''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC&pg=PA175|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=175}}</ref>

The North American species once described by [[Alexander Hanchett Smith|Alexander H.

==Habitat and distribution==
Being [[saprobic]], ''P. flammans'' is found exclusively on dead and decaying [[tree stump|stumps]] and [[trunk (botany)|trunks]] of coniferous trees, with fruit bodies appearing in [[Fascicle (botany)|tuft]]s or singly, from summer to autumn.<ref name=MushroomExpert/> It is a fungus with a wide geographical distribution in [[Taiga|boreal]] and [[temperate]] regions,<ref name=Bas1988/> and may be considered common<ref name=Bas1988/> to rare<ref name=Jordan2004/> depending upon the region in which it occurs. It is found throughout Europe (from the [[British Isles]] to Russia) and North America (southern Canada and the United States<ref name=Peterson/>). The species has also been collected in Asia, including India<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tewari VP, Singh RN |year=1973 |title=New records of Agaricales from India |journal=Norwegian Journal of Botany |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=21–25 |issn=0300-1156}}</ref> and China.<ref>{{cite book |title=Higher fungi of tropical China |author= Zhuang W|year=2001 |publisher=Mycotaxon Ltd |isbn=978-0-930845-13-1 |page=463}}</ref>
