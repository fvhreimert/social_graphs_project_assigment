'''''Suillus collinitus''''' is a [[Boletales|pored mushroom]] of the genus ''[[Suillus]]'' in the family [[Suillaceae]]. It is an [[edible mushroom]] found in European [[Pinus|pine]] forests. The mushroom has a reddish to chestnut-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that reaches up to {{convert|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, and a yellow stem measuring up to {{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. On the underside of the cap are small angular pores, initially bright yellow before turning greenish-brown with age. A characteristic feature that helps to distinguish it from similar ''Suillus'' species, such as ''[[Suillus granulatus|S.&nbsp;granulatus]]'',  is the pinkish [[mycelia]] at the base of the stem.

[[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis has shown the species to be related to other typical Mediterranean ''Suillus'' species such as ''[[Suillus bellinii|S.&nbsp;bellinii]]'', ''[[Suillus luteus|S.&nbsp;luteus]]'', and ''[[Suillus mediterraneensis|S.&nbsp;mediterraneensis]]''. ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' is a [[mycorrhizal]] species, and forms associations with several species of [[pine]], most notably the [[Aleppo pine]]. This tree species is commonly used in [[reforestation]] schemes and [[soil conservation]] against [[erosion]] in the [[Mediterranean region]], and ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' is often used as a beneficial [[wikt:inoculant|inoculant]] to help the young trees better survive in typically harsh soil conditions.

The species was [[species description|first described]] as ''Boletus collinitus'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838.<ref name=Fries1838/> [[Otto Kuntze]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Suillus]]'' in his 1898 ''Revisio Generum Plantarum''.<ref name=Kunzte1898/> In 1969 Dutch mycologist H.S.C. Huijsman described the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' var. ''aureus'' (as ''S.&nbsp;fluryi'' var. ''aureus''; ''S.&nbsp;fluryi'' is a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] of ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'')<ref name="urlFungorum synonymy: Suillus collinitus"/> based on a collection from Switzerland.<ref name=Huijsman1969/> The variety ''velatipes'' was described in 1998 by Giampaolo Simonini and colleagues from Italian collections.<ref name=Simonini1998/>

A 1996 [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular analysis]] of 38 different ''Suillus'' species used the sequences of their [[internal transcribed spacer]]s to infer [[phylogenetic]] relationships and clarify the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the genus. The results indicated that ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' is most closely related to a specimen of ''S.&nbsp;granuatus'' collected from Nepal. According to the authors, this Nepalese [[genetic isolate|isolate]] probably represents a species distinct from North American and European isolates, based on morphology and host tree association.<ref name=Kretzer1996/> In 2006, a phylogenetic analysis of ''Suillus'' isolates collected from Spain showed that ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' was closely related to other species "typical of the Mediterranean area", namely ''[[Suillus bellinii|S.&nbsp;bellinii]]'', ''[[Suillus luteus|S.&nbsp;luteus]]'', and ''[[Suillus mediterraneensis|S.&nbsp;mediterraneensis]]''.<ref name=RuizDiez2006/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''collinitus'' is derived from [[Latin]], and means "smeared" or "greased".<ref name=Roody2003/> The British botanist [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] called the mushroom the "ringless yellow boletus" in an 1873 publication.<ref name=Cooke1873/>

==Description==

The [[Basidiocarp|fruit body]] of ''Suillus collinitus'' is a medium to large, fleshy [[bolete]]. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially rounded, becoming convex and finally flat, reaching up to {{convert|11|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=Jordan1995/> The cap is covered with a brown [[Pileipellis|cuticle]] of variable shade that is decorated with minuscule radial striations, which become more obvious in fully expanded specimens and especially in dry weather. The cap is often shaped irregularly and becomes [[wikt:viscid|viscid]] (sticky) when damp. The [[Hymenium|tubes]] are short and their stem attachment is usually slightly [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]] to [[wikt:adnate|adnate]]. The small and angular pores are yellow but darken with age. Young, fresh specimens sometimes bear droplets of a clear fluid that collect on the pore surface.<ref name=Gerault/>

The cylindrical [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is often short and stubby, typically {{convert|4|–|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|1|–|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, coloured yellowish and ornamented with sparse reddish-brown granules. There is no [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The base of the stem bears pink overtones and is attached to distinctively pink [[mycelium|mycelial threads]], which are visible when the fruit body is uprooted. The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is yellowish, thick and soft. In a [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|colour reaction test]] with [[ammonia]] solution, the flesh turns reddish.<ref name=Gerault/>

The [[spore]]s are seen [[ochre]]-brown [[spore print|in mass]], but pale yellow when viewed with a [[light microscope]]. They are fusiform (tapered at each end), sized 8–10.5 by 3–4.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name=Gerault/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells of the [[hymenium]]) are four-spored.<ref name=Jordan1995/>

}}
Especially characteristic for ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' are the cap striations and pink mycelium. The fungus in many aspects resembles ''[[Suillus granulatus|S. granulatus]]'' – a common species in European pine forests. ''S.&nbsp;granulatus'', however, has a [[wikt:homogeneous|homogeneous]] brown cap without striations, and its mycelium is characteristically white.<ref name=Gerault/>

===Varieties===
Two [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' have been described. ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' var. ''aureus'' has a golden-yellow cap.<ref name="urlCHAMPYVES"/> ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' var. ''velatipes'', originally found in Italy growing in poor acidic soil in association with [[Aleppo pine]] (''Pinus halepensis''), is distinguished by a [[wikt:glutinous|glutinous]] brown veil at the base of the stem, and a slender white [[wikt:felting|felting]] at the cap margin.<ref name=Simonini1998/>

===Similar species===
''Suillus collinitus'' is often found in the same habitat with other thermophilic species, including ''S.&nbsp;mediterraneensis'' and ''[[Suillus bellinii|S.&nbsp;bellinii]]'', especially in the [[Mediterranean basin]]. Some common species which occur throughout much of Europe and also associate with two-needled pines include ''[[Suillus luteus|S.&nbsp;luteus]]'' and ''[[Suillus granulatus|S.&nbsp;granulatus]]''.

===Edibility===
Various authors regard ''Suillus collinitus'' as [[edible mushroom|edible]]<ref name=urlGrzyby/> with a sour odor and nondescript taste.<ref name=Jordan1995/> It is advisable, as for all species of ''Suillus'', to pick only young specimens and to peel the cuticle before preparation.<ref name=Basilicata2003/> The mushroom contains several [[tocopherols]], a class of chemical compounds collectively known as [[vitamin E]], and which confer [[antioxidant]] activity.<ref name=Heleno2010/> They also contain several [[organic acid]]s, most predominantly the pairs [[malic acid|malic]] and [[quinic acid|quinic]] acids, and [[citric acid|citric]] and [[Alpha-Ketoglutaric acid|ketoglutaric acid]], which respectively make up 42% and 30% of total organic acids. The composition and concentration of organic acids in mushrooms are major factors in influencing their flavour; some organic acids contribute to antioxidant activity.<ref name=Valentao2005/>

==Distribution, habitat, and ecology==

''Suillus collinitus'' is found throughout Europe. It is an [[ectomycorrhizal]] fungus, forming mutually beneficial [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with several species of [[Pinus|pine]] (''Pinus''). These include several two-needled European species of pine: [[Aleppo pine]] (''P.&nbsp;halepensis'') [[European black pine]] (''P.&nbsp;nigra''), [[stone pine]] (''P.&nbsp;pinea''), and  [[Scots pine]] (''P.&nbsp;sylvestris''). The fungus favours [[limestone]] soils.<ref name=urlDAMyko/> ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' is [[wikt:thermophilic|thermophilic]], commonly occurring in southern Europe. It is rarely seen in more northern regions, such as the British Isles and Poland.<ref name=Jordan1995/><ref name=urlGrzyby/> It is [[Regional Red List|red-listed]] in Denmark as near-threatened,<ref name="redlistDK"/> and in Estonia as endangered.<ref name="redlistEE"/> It has also been collected in Iran.<ref name=Asef2008/>

The mushroom was reported in the municipality of Paipa, in the department of Boyaca, in Colombia. It was reported by mycologyst Juan Camilo Rodríguez Martínez.

''Suillus collinitus'' is the most frequent fungus associating with Aleppo pine – a hardy tree utilised for [[reforestation]] schemes and [[soil conservation]] against [[erosion]] in the [[Mediterranean region]]. A study performed in the south of France discovered that ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' and ''[[Suillus mediterraneensis|S.&nbsp;mediterraneensis]]'' are multi-stage ectomycorrhizal fungi, associating with both young and mature stands of Aleppo pine. These two species may play a key role in the survival and adaptation of this species of pine on disturbed [[calcareous]] sites. Roots mycorrhizal with ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' were found capable of surviving successive disturbances by fire or ploughing. Moreover, the fungus retained its viability to propagate via its mycelial network which helped the recolonisation effort of newly introduced trees.<ref name=ElKarkouri2004/> The fungus has also been shown to improve the growth of Mediterranean pines grown in [[greenhouse]]s and [[plant nursery|nurseries]].<ref name=Torres1994/><ref name=Mousain1988/> Unlike other ''Suillus'' species that grow in wet climates, such as ''[[Suillus grevillei|S.&nbsp;grevillei]]''<ref name=Zhou2001/> and ''[[Suillus spraguei|S.&nbsp;spraguei]]'',<ref name=Hirose2004/> ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'' does not typically produce fruit bodies in young plantations. This fruiting behaviour may be attributed to the typically nutrient-poor [[xeric]] Mediterranean environment in combination with a lack of tree [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]. The absence of above-ground indicators of fungal presence makes analysis of underground populations difficult; [[molecular marker]]s have been developed to assist in monitoring fungal growth and ectomycorrhizal formation and persistence in young plantations.<ref name=Karkouri2005/>]]

The ectomycorrizhae formed between several ''Suillus'' species and Aleppo pine has been studied under ''[[in vitro]]'' conditions in the laboratory. Tree shoots inoculated with either ''S.&nbsp;collinitus'', ''S.&nbsp;bellinii'', and ''S.&nbsp;mediterraneensis'' tended to grow better and showed superior mycorrhizal development than other tested ''Suillus'' species, suggesting that the three have a "physiological specificity" for the tree.<ref name=RuizDiez2006/> A 2010 publication reported that the fungal hyphae are covered in crystals of [[oxalic acid]], which, in addition to reducing [[soil pH]], reduces [[grazing]] by the soil micro[[arthropod]] ''[[Folsomia candida]]''.<ref name=Boelmann2010/>
