==Description==
''Neolentinus lepideus'' fruit bodies are tough, fleshy, [[agaric]]s of variable size. The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is at first convex and flattens with maturity while the margin remains enrolled. The cap may grow up to about {{Convert|13|cm|frac=4}}, while the [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] grows to {{Convert|12|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} in height.<ref name="jordan">{{cite book |author=Jordan |first=Michael |title=The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe |publisher=David & Charles |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-7153-0129-6 |page=329}}</ref><ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=207}}</ref> The white, cream to pale-brown cap cuticle is distinctively covered with concentrically arranged dark scales<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/142/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=142 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> which become denser towards the depressed cap centre.

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white and their attachment to the stem is adnate to subdecurrent or decurrent.

=== Similar species ===
''[[Neolentinus ponderosus]]'' is similar but has no [[partial veil]], and thus no ring.<ref name=":0" /> ''[[Pleurotus levis]]'' grows on hardwoods, with a more fuzzy cap lacking scales.<ref name="audu" />

==Habitat and distribution==
The [[fruiting bodies]] of ''Neolentinus lepideus'' are found singly or in tufts emerging from dead and decaying [[conifer]]ous wood, favouring [[pine]]s (''Pinus'') including old [[Tree stump|stump]]s, [[logging|log]]s, and [[timber]]. It may also be found in gardens, on man-made wooden structures such as old [[railroad tie]]s, and in such unusual places as [[coal mines]]. Less frequently, it is also found on non-coniferous [[hardwood]]. Its fruiting season is spring to autumn and it is common in Europe and North America.<ref name="Bas1988" /><ref name="rogersmushrooms">{{cite web | title=''Lentinus lepideus'' at Rogers Mushrooms | publisher=Rogers Plants Ltd | url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~6280.asp | access-date=January 3, 2010 }}</ref> In the latter, it appears from May to November (slightly shorter in the west).<ref name="audu" /> There have also been multiple reports of its occurrence in the [[Western Cape]], South Africa.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ispotnature.org/node/825596|title=Lentinus lepideus|access-date=2016-12-24}}</ref>

==Ecology==
''Neolentinus lepideus'' has a [[saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] mode of nutrition and is an important woodland [[decomposer]] and a cause of [[wet rot]] in building materials. The fungus has shown tolerance of wood treated with [[creosote]] and other preservatives, and has been used in experiments to evaluate the efficacy of treatment methods.<ref name="57.pdf">{{cite journal | author=Duncan C., Deverall F. |year=1963 | title=Degradation of Wood Preservatives by Fungi | journal=Applied Microbiology | volume=12 | issue= 1| pages=57–62 |doi=10.1128/AM.12.1.57-62.1964 | pmid=16349644 | pmc=1058065}}</ref>

==Edibility==
Some authors consider the species [[Edible mushroom|edible]],<ref name=rogersmushrooms/><ref name=jordan/> especially when young, but it requires cooking to soften.<ref name="Arora1986" /><ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=146|author-link1=Orson K. Miller Jr.}}</ref> While there have been no recorded [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonings]], the fungus may come in contact with [[hazardous chemicals]] because its fruiting bodies tend to grow on human-made wooden structures, such as wooden [[railroad tie]]s smeared with [[creosote]].<ref name="jordan" />{{Verification needed|date=December 2024}}
