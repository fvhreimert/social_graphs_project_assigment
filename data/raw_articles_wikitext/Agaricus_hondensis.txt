'''''Agaricus hondensis''''', commonly known as the '''felt-ringed agaricus''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Agaricaceae]]. The species was officially described in 1912 by mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]], along with three other ''[[Agaricus]]'' species that have since been placed in [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] with ''A.&nbsp;hondensis''.

The fungus produces [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) with white to gray-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter covered with pale pinkish-brown scales that darken in age. The tightly-packed [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the cap underside are initially white before becoming pinkish, [[lilac (color)|lilac]]-gray, and finally brownish as the [[spore]]s mature.  The stout [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is bulbous and has a thick, white, felt-like [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The mushroom has an unpleasant odor similar to [[phenol]] or [[creosote]], and develops a soapy-metallic taste when cooked. It can be distinguished from similar ''Agaricus'' species by differences in geographic range, habitat, staining reaction, and odor.

Found in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America, ''A.&nbsp;hondensis'' fruits in the fall under [[conifer]]s or in [[mixed forest]]s. The mushroom is [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]], causing severe gastrointestinal upset if consumed.

==Taxonomy==

The species was first [[species description|described]] as new to science by American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1912, based on collections he made in November, 1911 under Californian [[redwoods]]. In the same publication, Murrill also described the species ''Agaricus bivelatoides'', ''A.&nbsp;hillii'', and ''A.&nbsp;macmurphyi'', all from the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America. The latter two were named to honor their original collectors, Albert Hill and [[James Ira Wilson McMurphy]], respectively, while the former was named for its resemblance to ''[[Agaricus bivelatus|A.&nbsp;bivelatus]]''.<ref name="Murrill 1912"/> In 1944, [[Alexander H. Smith]] examined the type material of several of Murrill's species, and concluded that were no [[phenotypic trait|characters]] to separate ''A.&nbsp;hondensis'' from ''A.&nbsp;bivelatoides'', ''A.&nbsp;hillii'', or ''A.&nbsp;macmurphyi''. He also determined that [[Sanford Myron Zeller]]'s ''A.&nbsp;glaber'', published as new in 1938,<ref name="Zeller 1938"/> was also the same species as ''A.&nbsp;hondensis''.<ref name="Smith 1944"/> The nomenclatural database [[MycoBank]] considers these names [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Agaricus hondensis"/>

''Agaricus hondensis'' has traditionally been [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Xanthodermatei'', a grouping of ''Agaricus'' species related to ''[[Agaricus xanthodermus|A.&nbsp;xanthodermus]]'' that are characterized by fruit bodies with [[phenol]]ic odors, temporary yellowing discolorations in some parts of the fruit body, a negative [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification#Schaeffer’s test|Schaeffer’s reaction]], and [[Mushroom poisoning|toxicity]]. A [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis has shown that it, along with the related species ''[[Agaricus freirei|A.&nbsp;freirei]]'' and ''[[Agaricus phaeolepidotus|A.&nbsp;phaeolepidotus]]'', comprise a [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] lineage in a [[clade]] of related [[wikt:sylvan|sylvan]] species that have weak yellowing reactions and some tendencies toward reddish bruising reactions. This lineage is closely related to a group of ''Agaricus'' species that are typically placed in the section ''Sanguinolenti''. Phylogenetic evidence suggests that these three species belong to a clade that [[Genetic divergence|diverged]] shortly after the presumed split of the sections ''Xanthodermatei'' and ''Duploannulati''.<ref name="Kerrigan 2005"/>

===Etymology===

The [[specific name (botany)|epithet]] ''hondensis'' refers to the [[type (biology)|type]] location, [[La Honda, California]].<ref name="Murrill 1912"/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "felt-ringed agaricus".<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/>

==Description==


The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially globose, then convex and sometimes flattening out, with a diameter of {{convert|6–15|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}}.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=547}}</ref> The dry and smooth cap surface is whitish or has pale pinkish-brown to pinkish-gray to [[fawn (colour)|fawn]]-colored flattened fibrils or fine [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] scales (at least in the center). In maturity, the fibrils usually darken to brown, reddish-brown, or reddish-gray, but in one northern form the fibrils are darker brown from the beginning. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick and white. When bruised or injured, the flesh either does not change color, or may stain pale yellowish, then often slowly discolors pinkish. The odor of the crushed flesh is mild or faintly phenolic, but is usually distinctly phenolic in the base of the stipe.<ref name="Arora 1986"/>

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially pale pinkish to pinkish-gray before becoming brown, then chocolate-brown or darker when the [[Basidiospore|spores]] mature. In maturity, the gills are free from attachment to the stipe, and are packed close together with little intervening spaced between them. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|7–20|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} long, and {{convert|1–3|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick but with a thicker or bulbous base.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=226–227|oclc=797915861}}</ref> Firm, smooth, and lacking the scales found on the cap, the stipe is white but discolors dingy pinkish or brownish in age or after handling. The flesh in the extreme base usually stains pale yellowish when bruised. The [[partial veil]] is membranous, white, and forms a thick, felt-like [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the upper portion of the stipe. The ring is skirtlike but often flares outward instead of collapsing against the stipe.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> A drop of dilute [[potassium hydroxide]] placed on the cap turns yellow.<ref name="urlMushroomExpert"/>



[[Spore print]]s are purplish brown to chocolate brown. The smooth, thick-walled spores are broadly [[ellipsoid]]al, and typically measure 5.8–7.3 by 3.7–4.4&nbsp;[[μm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, [[hyaline]] (translucent, and measure 20–21.3 by 5.8–7.0&nbsp;μm. [[Cystidia]] on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are sac-shaped to club-shaped, hyaline to pale yellowish brown in color, and have dimensions of 18.3–25.6 by 7.3–11.0&nbsp;μm; there are no cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia).<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/>

Distinctive field characteristics of ''A.&nbsp;hondensis'' include its woodland habitat, the yellow staining reaction with KOH, and its odor.<ref name="Lincoff 1981"/> ''Agaricus freirei'', found in coastal regions of Spain,<ref name="Blanco-Dios 2001"/> closely resembles ''A.&nbsp;hondensis'', and is a close genetic relative.<ref name="Kerrigan 2005"/> ''A.&nbsp;hondensis'' has also been confused with ''[[Agaricus silvaticus|A.&nbsp;silvaticus]]'' and ''[[Agaricus placomyces|A.&nbsp;placomyces]]''.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/> ''A.&nbsp;sylvaticus'' does not have foul-smelling flesh, and has a negative KOH reaction.<ref name="Noordeloos 2001"/> ''A.&nbsp;placomyces'' is found from the midwestern United States eastward.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> Another lookalike, the edible ''[[Agaricus subrutilescens|A.&nbsp;subrutilescens]]'', has similar overall coloration, but is distinguished by a mild odor, a shaggy stipe, and a less substantial ring.<ref name="Trudell 2009"/> ''[[Agaricus moelleri|A.&nbsp;moelleri]]'' is also similar.<ref name=":0" />

==Habitat and distribution==

A [[saprobic]] species,<ref name="urlMushroomExpert"/> the fruit bodies of ''A.&nbsp;hondensis'' grow scattered or in groups under [[conifer]]s or in [[mixed forest]]s.<ref name="Trudell 2009"/> They have also been reported to grow in [[fairy ring]]s.<ref name="urlMushroomExpert"/> The fungus is found in the [[Pacific Coast]] of North America, from [[British Columbia]] in Canada south to [[California]],<ref name="Schalkwijk-Barendsen 1991"/> but is most common in California.<ref name="Trudell 2009"/> The mushroom fruits in the fall from September to October throughout much of its range, but in California the fruiting season tends to be from November to February.<ref name="Lincoff 1981"/>

==Toxicity==
''Agaricus hondensis'' mushrooms are [[mushroom poisoning|toxic]], and consuming the fruit bodies causes [[gastroenteritis]].<ref name="Barceloux 2008"/> Some fruit bodies smell of [[creosote]], an odor that becomes even more prevalent if the mushrooms are cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/> The fruit bodies are used as food by the [[vagrant shrew]] (''Sorex vagrans'') and the [[American shrew mole]] (''Neurotrichus gibbsii'').<ref name="Terry 1978"/> Relatively high levels of the chemical [[hydroquinone]] are present in fruit bodies.<ref name="Jovel 1996"/>
