'''''Hydnellum ferrugineum''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''mealy tooth''' or the '''reddish-brown corky spine fungus''', is a species of [[tooth fungus]] in the family [[Bankeraceae]]. A widely distributed species, it is found in north Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. The fungus fruits on the ground singly or in clusters in [[conifer forest]], usually in poor (low nutrient) or sandy soil. [[basidiocarp|Fruit bodies]] are somewhat [[Spinning top|top]]-shaped, measuring {{convert|3|–|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. Their velvety surfaces, initially white to pink, sometimes exude drops of red liquid. The lower surface of the fruit body features white to reddish-brown spines up to 6&nbsp;mm long. Mature fruit bodies become dark reddish brown in color, and are then difficult to distinguish from other similar ''[[Hydnellum]]'' species. ''H.&nbsp;ferrugineum'' forms a mat of [[mycelia]] in the [[humus]] and upper soil where it grows. The presence of the fungus changes the characteristics of the soil, making it more [[podzol]]ized.

==Taxonomy==
The species was originally [[species description|described]] scientifically by [[Elias Magnus Fries]], who named it ''Hydnum ferrugineum'' in 1815. Its [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history includes transfers to the genera ''Calodon'' by [[Petter Karsten]] in 1881, and ''Phaeodon'' by [[Joseph Schröter]] in 1888.<ref name="urlFungorum synonymy: Hydnellum ferrugineum"/><ref name="Pegler p.86"/> It was assigned its current binomial name by Karsten when he transferred it to its current genus, ''[[Hydnellum]]'', in 1879.<ref name="Karsten 1879"/>

In 1964, Canadian mycologist [[Kenneth A. Harrison]] described a [[hydnoid fungus]] found with ''[[Pinus resinosa]]'' in [[Michigan]] and ''[[Pinus banksiana]]'' in [[Nova Scotia]]. The fungus, which Harrison named ''Hydnellum pineticola'',<ref name="Harrison 1964"/> is considered to be [[synonym (biology)|synonymous]] with ''Hydnellum ferrugineum'' by the nomenclatural database [[Index Fungorum]].<ref name="urlFungorum: Hydnellum pineticola"/> Harrison noted "The attempts to recognize European species in North American collections has only increased the confusion in this country, and until someone has worked critically in the field on both continents, it is better to make a recognizable grouping of our own population as that to guess that they may be the same as those that grow in Europe."<ref name="Harrison 1964"/> Other taxa considered synonymous with ''H.&nbsp;ferrugineum'' are [[Pierre Bulliard]]'s 1791 ''Hydnum hybridum'' (including later synonyms ''Calodon hybridus'' (Bull.) Lindau, and ''Hydnellum hybridum'' (Bull.) Banker); [[Louis Secretan]]'s ''Hydnum carbunculus'' (1833); and [[Howard James Banker]]'s 1906 ''Hydnellum sanguinarium''.<ref name="urlFungorum synonymy: Hydnellum ferrugineum"/> Banker explained the difficulty in identifying old ''Hydnellum'' specimens: "A considerable number of collections have had to be set aside, as in the dried state, with no notes on the fresh characters, it was impossible to decide with any degree of satisfaction whether the plants represented ''H.&nbsp;sanguinarium'', ''H.&nbsp;concrescens'', ''H.&nbsp;scrobiculatum'', or some undescribed form."<ref name="Banker 1906"/>

[[Common name]]s given to the species include the "reddish-brown corky spine fungus",<ref name="Pegler p.86"/> and the [[British Mycological Society]]-sanctioned name "mealy fungus".<ref name="urlBMS"/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''ferrugineum'' is [[Latin]] for "rust-colored".<ref name="Harrison 2012"/>

==Description==
 showing the spines]]
The fruit bodies of ''Hydnellum ferrugineum'' are more or less top-shaped with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are {{convert|3|–|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. They are at first convex, then pulvinate (cushion-shaped), later flattening or becoming slightly depressed in the center. The cap surface of young fruit bodies is uneven, with a velvety to felted texture, and a whitish to pink color. It sometimes exudes blood-red drops of fluid in the depressions. The surface later becomes flesh-colored to dark reddish brown, but with wavy margin remaining whitish. The lower surface of the fruit body bears the [[hymenium]], the fertile [[spore]]-bearing tissue. It comprises a dense arrangement of white to reddish brown spines up to 6&nbsp;mm long, hanging vertically downwards. The stout [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] measures {{convert|1|–|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|–|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and is the same color as the cap.<ref name="Ellis 1990"/> Fruit bodies have a "distinctly mealy" odor (similar to the smell of freshly ground flour),<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> but are inedible.<ref name="Deconchat 2002"/>

The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is reddish or purplish-brown with white flecks.<ref name="Ellis 1990"/> Initially spongy and soft, it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures. In the stipe, the flesh can become blackish in age.<ref name="Rea 1922"/> Like other ''Hydnellum'' species, fruit body tissue is made of generative [[hypha]]e that do not expand. This slows the growth of the fruit body, often enabling it to persist for several months.<ref>Pegler, Roberts, Spooner (1997), p.&nbsp;3.</ref> The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern, in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap. Any solid objects encountered during growth, such as grass or twigs, can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body. Similarly, closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth.<ref>Pegler, Roberts, Spooner (1997), p.&nbsp;5.</ref>

The broadly [[ellipsoid]] to roughly spherical [[basidiospore|spores]] are 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. Their surfaces are covered with small rounded bumps. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are narrowly club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 25–30 by 6–7.5&nbsp;μm. The hyphae of the flesh are brownish with thin walls, and measure 4–6&nbsp;μm; hyphae in the spines are thin-walled, [[septum|septate]], and sometimes branched, measuring 3.5–4.5&nbsp;μm. The hyphae do not have [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name="Pegler p.86"/>

===Similar species===
''[[Hydnellum peckii]]'' is similar in appearance, but has an acrid taste, and clamp connections in its hyphae.<ref name="Pegler p.86"/> ''[[Hydnellum spongiosipes]]'' is readily confused with ''H.&nbsp;ferrugineum'', and several authors have historically considered the two species to be the same; [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] studies, however, indicate that the two fungi are closely related, but distinct.<ref name="ENRR 2004"/> In contrast with ''H.&nbsp;ferrugineum'', ''H.&nbsp;spongiosipes'' has a darker cap when young, darker flesh, and occurs in deciduous woods.<ref name="Pegler p.86"/> Old fruit bodies of ''H.&nbsp;ferrugineum'' can be confused with those of ''[[Hydnellum concrescens]]''.<ref name="Deconchat 2002"/>

==Habitat and distribution==

''Hydnellum ferrugineum'' is found mainly in [[coniferous forest|coniferous woodland]], often near [[pine]]s, but occasionally with [[spruce]]. Fruit bodies have a preference for sandy soil with low levels of [[organic matter]] and nutrients,<ref name="Pegler p.86"/> and grow singly or in clusters.<ref name="Ellis 1990"/> They are more likely to be found in [[Old-growth forest|older-growth forests]].<ref name="Nitare 2006"/> The fungus occurs in North America, including Mexico. It is widespread but generally uncommon throughout Europe, although there may be local areas where it is common. In Britain, ''H.&nbsp;ferrugineum'' is provisionally classified as [[endangered species|endangered]], and is protected under the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981]];<ref name="Marren 2000"/> it was included as one of 14 species considered in the [[United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan]] for stipitate hydnoid fungi (i.e., hydnoid fungi with a cap and stipe) in 2004.<ref name="ENRR 2004"/> The fungus is [[protected species|protected]] in [[Montenegro]].<ref name="Kasom 2010"/> It has been collected in India<ref name="Sultana 2007"/> and North Africa.<ref name="Pegler p.86"/>

The fungus forms a tough mat of [[mycelium|mycelia]] in the [[humus]] and upper soil of pine forests. This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees, and can cover an area of several square meters. These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses; [[reindeer lichen]]s often occur in the center of large mats. The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil, resulting in a thinner humus layer, decreased [[groundwater]] penetration, decreased [[soil pH]], and increases in the level of [[soil gas|root respiration]] as well as the quantity of roots.<ref name="Hintikka 1967"/> The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations. Soil with the mycelium becomes more [[podzol]]ized than the surrounding soil.<ref name="Hintikka 1967"/> Similar to some other ''Hydnellum'' species, ''H.&nbsp;ferrugineum'' is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from [[clear-cutting]], a [[forestry]] practice used in some areas of Europe.<ref name="Arnolds 2010"/> The fungus forms an unusual type of [[mycorrhiza]] with [[Scots pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris'') in which the [[ectomycorrhiza]] appears normal at the leading edge of the mycelial mat, but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge, showing [[saprophytic]] tendencies.<ref name="Trappe 2012"/>

==Bioactive compounds==
''Hydnellum ferrugineum'' fruit bodies contain the [[biological pigment|pigment]]s hydnuferrigin (dark violet) and hydnuferruginin (yellow), as well as small amounts of the [[polyphenol]] compound [[atromentin]]. Hydnuferrigin has a chemical structure that closely resembles that of [[thelephoric acid]], a pigment found in other species of ''Hydnellum'' and ''[[Hydnum]]'', and they may originate from a common [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] compound.<ref name="Gripenberg 1981"/>
