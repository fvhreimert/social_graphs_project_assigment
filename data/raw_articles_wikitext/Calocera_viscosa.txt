'''''Calocera viscosa''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Dacrymycetaceae]]. In the United Kingdom, it has the recommended English name of '''yellow stagshorn'''.<ref name="BMS"/> In North America it is variously called '''coral jelly fungus''',<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> '''jelly staghorn''',<ref name="McKnight 2021"/> '''yellow false coral''',<ref name=Bessette/> '''yellow tuning fork''',<ref name="Rhodes2013"/> and '''jelly antler'''.<ref name="Winkler2022"/>

The [[basidiocarp]]s (fruit bodies) are small, gelatinous, bright golden yellow, and branched. ''Calocera viscosa'' grows on logs and dead wood of [[conifer]]s. It is a common species throughout Europe and has also been recorded from North America, Asia, and Australia.

==Taxonomy==
The species was originally described as ''Clavaria aurea'' by the German naturalist and explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in 1793, but the name is [[nom. illegit.|illegitimate]] since it had already been used for a different species.<ref name="Roberts2011"/> The species was legitimately described as ''Clavaria viscosa'' from Germany in 1794 by South African-born mycologist [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]]. It was transferred to the genus ''[[Calocera]]'' by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1827.

A white fungus from Italy was described as ''Calocera cavarae'' in 1896, but later studies suggested that this was only an aberrant form of ''C.&nbsp;viscosa'' lacking yellow pigments.<ref name="Reid1988"/><ref name="Roberts1994"/>

==Description==
''Calocera viscosa'' forms bright golden to orange-yellow (rarely white), firmly gelatinous fruit bodies up to {{Convert|10|cm|frac=4}} tall, with a paler stem and coral-like branches.<ref name="McNabb1965"/> 

The fruit bodies are too slight to be of culinary interest.<ref name=Arora1986/>

===Microscopic characters===
[[Hypha]]e lack [[clamp connection]]s. The [[basidia]] are two-spored and typical of the Dacrymycetaceae. The [[spore]]s are weakly allantoid (sausage-shaped), 8 to 12.5 by 3.5 to 4.5&nbsp;[[μm]], thin-walled, becoming tardily once-septate.<ref name="McNabb1965"/><ref name="Reid1974"/>
