==Taxonomy==
''Tricholoma saponaceum'' was first described in 1818 by seminal mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] and given the name ''Agaricus saponaceus'', before being placed in the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]'' by German mycologist [[Paul Kummer]] in 1871. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''saponaceum'' is derived from the [[Latin]] 'of or pertaining to [[soap]]'.<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London| isbn=0-304-52257-0|page = 883}}</ref> Its names in other European languages, such as French ''Tricolome à odeur de savon'', and German ''Seifenritterling'' have a similar derivation to its English names-soap-scented toadstool, soapy knight or soap tricholoma—all relating to its soapy scent.<ref name="arora86"/><ref name=nilper>{{cite book | last = Nilson|first= Sven |author2=Olle Persson  | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page=30}}</ref>

''Tricholoma saponaceum'' is yet another fungus which may represent a species complex of two or more species. The variety ''ardosiacum'', described by Italian mycologist [[Giacomo Bresadola]], has a dark blue-grey cap.

==Description==
''Tricholoma saponaceum'' has a convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] about {{convert|4-15|cm|abbr=on}} across, with a vague [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The colour is highly variable, with greyish, greenish, olive, yellowish and brownish shades reported. The cap is paler at the margin and fades with age. The widely spaced [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed and whitish, although may be tinted pale green and bruise pink. The whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (also sometimes displaying colors present in the cap) lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and can be swollen in its midriff, and measures {{convert|4–12|cm|1|abbr=on}} tall by {{convert|1–3|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name=":0" />

The flesh can but does not always stain pink-orange, and this color may already be present in the flesh of the stipe's base.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=106}}</ref> The [[spore print]] is white, and the oval smooth spores measure 5–6 × 3–4&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="arora86"/> The odour is distinctive and has been likened to newly scrubbed floors or soap.<ref name=nilper/>

===Similar species===
Its gills may lead it to being confused with ''[[Hygrophorus]]'' species.<ref name="arora86"/> It is similar in appearance to ''[[Tricholoma griseoviolaceum]]''.<ref name=":0" />

==Distribution and habitat==
''Tricholoma saponaceum'' is a terrestrial mushroom found in Europe and North America. It is abundant in the Pacific Northwest and Rocky Mountains.<ref name="arora86"/> It is found in [[conifer]]ous and [[deciduous]] woodlands (more commonly the former in North America) from late summer to late autumn. [[Spruce]], [[live oak]], [[tanoak]], and [[madrone]] are species it can be associated with in the western United States.<ref name="arora86"/> It is associated with oak in Central and southern Europe.<ref name=nilper/>

==Toxicity==
