'''''Turbinellus floccosus''''', commonly known as the '''scaly vase''', or sometimes the '''shaggy''', '''scaly''', or '''woolly chanterelle''', is a [[Basidiocarp#Types|cantharelloid]] mushroom of the family [[Gomphaceae]]. It was known as '''''Gomphus floccosus''''' until 2011, when it was found to be only distantly related to the genus's [[type species|type]] species, ''[[Gomphus clavatus|G.&nbsp;clavatus]]''. It was consequently transferred from ''[[Gomphus (fungus)|Gomphus]]'' to ''[[Turbinellus]]''. The orange-capped vase- or trumpet-shaped [[basidiocarp|fruiting bodies]] may reach 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) high and 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) wide. The lower surface, the [[hymenium]], is covered in wrinkles and ridges rather than [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] or pores, and is pale buff or yellowish to whitish.

Native to Asia and North America, ''T.&nbsp;floccosus'' forms symbiotic ([[ectomycorrhiza]]l) relationships with various types of [[conifer]], growing in coniferous woodlands across Eastern Asia, from North Korea to Pakistan, and in North America, more frequently in the west, in late summer and autumn. Though mild-tasting, they generally cause [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s of [[nausea]], [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]] when consumed. ''T.&nbsp;floccosus'' is eaten by local people in northeastern India, Nepal and Mexico.

==Taxonomy==
This species was first [[species description|described]]  as ''Cantharellus floccosus'' in 1834 by American mycologist [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]], who reported it growing in [[Beech#North America|beech]] woods in [[Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania]].<ref name="de Schweinitz 1834"/> Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''floccus'', meaning "tuft, or flock, of wool".<ref name="Simpson 1979"/> In 1839, [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] named a specimen from Canada as ''Cantharellus canadensis'' based on a manuscript by [[Johann Friedrich Klotzsch]], noting its affinity to ''[[Gomphus clavatus|C.&nbsp;clavatus]]''.<ref name="Berkeley 1839"/> A large specimen collected in Maine by [[Charles James Sprague]] was described as ''Cantharellus princeps'' in 1859 by Berkeley and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]].<ref name="Berkeley 1859"/> In 1891, German botanist [[Otto Kuntze]] renamed ''Cantharellus canadensis'' as ''Trombetta canadensis'', and ''C.&nbsp;floccosus'' as ''Merulius floccosus''.<ref name="Kuntz1891"/>{{efn|1=Kuntze published ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]'', his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice.<ref name="kuntze">{{cite web | author=Erickson RF | url=http://www.botanicus.org/creator/298 | title=Kuntze, Otto (1843–1907) | website=Botanicus.org | access-date=28 November 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208120607/http://www.botanicus.org/creator/298 | archive-date=8 December 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> Three [[taxon|taxa]] received new names: Kuntze coined the genus ''Trombetta'', to incorporate ''Cantharellus canadensis'' (as ''Trombetta canadensis''), while ''C. floccosus'' and ''C. princeps'' became ''Merulius floccosus'' and ''M. princeps'' respectively.<ref name="Kuntz1891"/> However, Kuntze's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists.<ref name="kuntze"/>}}

[[Franklin Sumner Earle]] made ''C. floccosus'' the [[type species]] of the new genus ''[[Turbinellus]]'' in 1909, in which he placed two other North American species. He remarked that the three "constitute a striking and well-marked genus which seems to have more in common with the club-shaped species of ''[[Craterellus]]'' than with the following genus where they have always been placed."<ref name="Earle 1909"/><!-- cites two previous sentences --> This was not widely taken up, as Earle's [[new combination]] was not published [[valid name (botany)|validly]] according to [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants|nomenclatural rules]].<ref name="urlFungorum: Turbinellus floccosus"/>

American mycologist [[Elizabeth Eaton Morse]] described ''Cantharellus bonarii'' in 1930. The [[type locality (biology)|type locality]] was [[General Grant National Park]] in [[Fresno County, California]].<ref name="Morse 1930"/> In 1945 ''C.&nbsp;floccosus'' and Morse's ''C.&nbsp;bonarii'' were transferred to ''[[Gomphus (fungus)|Gomphus]]'' by [[Rolf Singer]].<ref name="Singer 1945"/> The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|γομφος}}, {{Transliteration|grc|gomphos}}, meaning "plug" or "large wedge-shaped nail".<ref name="Liddell 1980"/> [[Alexander H. Smith|Alex H. Smith]] treated the members of ''Gomphus'' as two [[Section (botany)|sections]]—''Gomphus'' and ''Excavatus''—within ''Cantharellus'' in his 1947 review of chanterelles in western North America, as he felt there were no consistent characteristics that distinguished the genera. The shaggy chanterelle was placed in the latter section due to its scaly cap, lack of [[clamp connections]] and rusty-colored [[basidiospore|spores]].<ref name="Smith 1947"/> [[Roger Heim]] classified it in the genus ''Nevrophyllum'', before [[E.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;H. Corner]] returned it to ''Gomphus'' in 1966.<ref name="Giachini 2011"/>

It was known as ''Gomphus floccosus'' until 2011,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gomphus floccosus (Fungi of Bandelier National Monument) · iNaturalist |url=https://www.inaturalist.org/guide_taxa/402904 |access-date=2022-07-31 |website=iNaturalist |language=en}}</ref> when it was found to be only distantly related to the genus's [[type species|type]] species, ''G.&nbsp;clavatus''. The genus ''Gomphus'', along with several others in the Gomphaceae, was reorganized in the 2010s after [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis confirmed that the older [[morphology (biology)|morphology]]-based classification did not accurately represent [[phylogenetic]] relationships.<ref name="Giachini 2011"/><ref name="Giachini 2010"/><ref name="Giachini 2012"/> Thus the genus ''Turbinellus'' was resurrected and the taxon became ''Turbinellus floccosus''. Giachini also concluded ''G. bonarii'' was the same species.<ref name="Giachini 2011"/><!-- cites previous two sentences -->

''T. floccosus'' has been given the common names of ''scaly vase chanterelle'',<ref name="Bessette1996"/> ''scaly chanterelle'', ''woolly chanterelle'',<ref name=Arora1986/> or ''shaggy chanterelle'',<ref name="Tylutki 1987"/> though it is more closely related to [[stinkhorn]]s than [[Cantharellaceae|true chanterelles]].<ref name="Davis 2012"/>  In [[Nepal]], in the [[Sherpa language]], it is known as {{Transliteration|xsr|diyo chyau}} or {{Transliteration|xsr|khumbhe chyau}}, from the words {{Transliteration|xsr|diyo}}, meaning "oil lamp" and {{Transliteration|xsr|chyau}}, meaning "mushroom", as the fruit bodies have a shape similar to the local oil lamps.<ref name="Giri 2009"/> In Mexico, it is known as {{wikt-lang|es|corneta}} or {{wikt-lang|es|trompeta}}, or by the indigenous words {{lang|nah|oyamelnanácatl}}  ("fir mushroom", from [[Classical Nahuatl|Nahuatl]] {{wikt-lang|nci|oyametl}} "fir", and {{wikt-lang|nci|nanacatl}}  "mushroom"),<ref name="Montoya2003" /> {{lang|nah|tlapitzal}} (derived from {{lang|nci|[[tlapitzalli]]}}, Nahuatl for "trumpet")<ref name="Montoya2003" /> or {{lang|nah|tlapitzananácatl}} in [[Tlaxcala]].<ref name="González-Ávila 2013"/>

==Description==
, seen through a microscope]]

Adult [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are initially cylindrical, maturing to trumpet- or vase-shaped and reaching up to 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) in height and width.<ref name="Giachini 2004"/> There is no clear demarcation between the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]].<ref name="Smith 1947"/> The stipe can be up to 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) tall and {{Convert|6|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} wide, though it tapers to a narrower base. It is solid in younger specimens, though is often hollowed out by insect larvae in older.<ref name="Giachini 2004"/> At higher elevations, two or three fruit bodies may arise from one stipe. Colored various shades of reddish- to yellowish-orange, the cap surface is broken into scales, with the spaces between more yellow and the scales themselves more orange. The most colorful specimens occur in warm humid weather.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> Older specimens are often paler.<ref name=Arora1986/>

The white [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is fibrous and thick, though thins with age.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> Somewhat brittle, it can sometimes turn brown when cut or bruised. The smell has been reported as indistinct or "earthy and sweet", and the taste "sweet and sour".<ref name="Giachini 2004"/> The [[hymenium|spore-bearing undersurface]] is irregularly folded, forked or ridged rather than gilled and is pale buff or yellowish to whitish in color.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/> These ridges are up to {{convert|4|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}} high,<ref name="Giachini 2004"/> and are decurrent—they extend below and run down the cap's attachment to the stipe, though irregularly so.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> The [[spore print]] is brownish, the spores ellipsoid with dimensions of 12.4–16.8 × 5.8–7.3&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/> The spore surface is roughened with ornamentations that can be made visible under the microscope by [[staining]] with [[methyl blue]].<ref name="Kuo 2010"/>

The fruit bodies can last for some considerable time, growing slowly over a month. Mushrooms in subalpine and alpine areas are typically heavy-set with a short stipe, their growth slower in the cold climate. This latter form is seen at lower altitudes in colder seasons. Smith gave this the name [[form (botany)|forma]] ''rainierensis''. Conversely, mushrooms at low altitudes, such as in the [[redwood forest]]s, can grow and expand rapidly with large caps that have prominent scales. Smith described a paler form with a solid stipe from the [[Sierra Nevada]] as forma ''wilsonii''.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> American mycologist [[R.&nbsp;H. Petersen]] described an olive-capped form that is otherwise identical to the typical form.<ref name="Petersen 1971"/> These forms are not recognised as distinct.<ref name="urlFungorum: Turbinellus floccosus"/>

The related ''[[Turbinellus kauffmanii]]'', found in western North America, is similar-looking but has a pale brown cap.<ref name="Davis 2012"/> Younger specimens of the latter species also have a pungent smell.<ref name="Smith 1947"/> ''[[Turbinellus fujisanensis]]'', found in Japan, is another lookalike that has smaller spores than ''T.&nbsp;floccosus''.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> ''Gomphus clavatus'' is superficially similar.<ref name="Davis 2012" />

==Distribution and habitat==
The fungus appears to form symbiotic ([[ectomycorrhiza]]l) relationships with various conifers including [[Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii''), [[fir]] (''Abies'') species such as momi fir (''[[Abies firma]]''), European silver fir (''[[Abies alba|A.&nbsp;alba]]'') and Khinghan fir (''[[Abies nephrolepis|A.&nbsp;nephrolepis]]''), [[pine]] (''Pinus'') species such as ''[[Pinus densiflora]]'' and western hemlock (''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'').<ref name="Giachini 2004"/><ref name="Petersen 1971"/> In Mexico, the fungus associates with ''[[Abies religiosa]]''<ref name="Burrola-Aguilar 2013"/>—the [[mycorrhiza]]l association between these two species has been synthesized under controlled laboratory conditions.<ref name="Lamus 2015"/> ''T.&nbsp;floccosus'' is more abundant in older stands of trees and places where there is more decomposed wood on the forest floor.<ref name="Giachini 2004"/>

The species occurs in [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forests]] in North America, particularly the western states in late summer and autumn. It is most abundant in rainy parts of the [[Pacific Northwest]],<ref name="Petersen 1971"/> northern California and the Sierra Nevada.<ref name=Arora1986/> It also occurs across Asia, having been recorded from Japan,<ref name="Corner 1966"/><ref name="Masui 1926"/> North Korea,<ref name="Wojewoda 1993"/> China,<ref name="Corner 1966"/> Tibet,<ref name="Petersen 1971"/> India,<ref name="Verma 1989"/> Nepal and Pakistan.<ref name="Smith 1947"/><ref name="Corner 1966"/><!-- cites both previous countries --> ''Turbinellus floccosus'' has been occasionally recorded from introduced conifer plantations in Australia.<ref name="Fuhrer 2005"/>

==Toxicity==


''Turbinellus floccosus'' is [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] to some people who eat it, but has been consumed without incident by others.<ref name="Smith 1980"/> Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea may occur, though are sometimes delayed by up to 8–14 hours. A [[tricarboxylic acid]] known as α-tetradecylcitric acid may be responsible for the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/><ref name="Carrano 1967"/> Laboratory experiments showed it increased [[Muscle tone|tone]] of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel (ileum), and that when given to rats, it led to [[mydriasis]], skeletal muscle weakness, and central nervous system depression.<ref name="Carrano 1967"/> ''Turbinellus floccosus'' contains more than double the amount of this acid than the related ''T.&nbsp;kauffmanii''.<ref name="Henry 1969"/>

Despite its toxicity, ''T.&nbsp;floccosus'' is one of the ten wild mushrooms most widely consumed by ethnic tribes in [[Meghalaya]], northeast India,<ref name="Khaund 2014"/> and is highly regarded by the [[Sherpa people]] in the vicinity of [[Sagarmatha National Park]] in Nepal.<ref name="Giri 2009"/> What is not known is whether the Indian populations of ''T.&nbsp;floccosus'' are nontoxic, or whether the local people have developed an immunity to it.<ref name="Khaund 2014b"/> It is also enjoyed in Mexico.<ref name="González-Ávila 2013"/> American mycologist [[David Arora]] reported that some enjoyed it while he felt it had a strong sour taste.<ref name=Arora1986/>

The fruit body of ''T.&nbsp;floccosus'' produces [[oxylipin]] ([[lipid]]s generated by oxygenation of [[fatty acid]]s) that are [[antifungal|active against]] the fungal plant pathogens ''[[Colletotrichum fragariae]]'', ''[[Colletotrichum gloeosporioides|C.&nbsp;gloeosporioides]]'', and ''[[Colletotrichum acutatum|C.&nbsp;acutatum]]''.<ref name="Cantrell 2008"/> Extracts of the fungus have shown in [[Agar diffusion test|standard laboratory tests]] to have [[antimicrobial]] activity against several [[human pathogen]]ic strains.<ref name="Khaund 2014b"/> ''T.&nbsp;floccosus'' also contains the di[[catechol]][[spermidine]] derivative pistillarin, a compound that inhibits [[DNA damage]] by [[hydroxyl radical]]s generated by the [[Fenton reaction]].<ref name="Lee 2011"/> Pistillarin is responsible for the green color obtained when [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification#Iron salts|iron salts]] are applied to the fruit body surface.<ref name="Kuo 2010"/>
