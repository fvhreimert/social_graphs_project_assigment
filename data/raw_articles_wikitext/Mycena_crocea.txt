'''''Mycena crocea''''', commonly known as the '''walnut mycena''', is a species of [[mushroom]] in the family [[Mycenaceae]].

The small mushroom has a bright yellow, conical to broadly convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is tough and thin, up to {{convert|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} tall, bright yellow at the top becoming progressively  orange towards the base. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate, subdistant, and yellowish, becoming lighter in age; and the [[spore print]] is white.

The mushroom is [[saprobic]] and found exclusively on hickory nuts and walnuts in eastern North America.

==Taxonomy==
It was first described as ''Marasmius nucicola'' in 1925 but that name could not be used in ''Mycena''.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "walnut mycena" and was previously and commonly misidentified as ''Mycena luteopallens''.<ref name="MaasG_1991" />

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''crocea'' refers to the orange color.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is vivid yellow, conical to broadly convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and up to {{convert|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=426}}</ref> When young the cap tends to be conical or bell-shaped becoming plane or flat at maturity. The margin is striated.  The surface is moist, glabrous, and somewhat [[hygrophanous]]. The flesh is thin, pallid, and yellowish. The odor and taste are not distinctive. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an adnate attachment and are a pale yellowish color. They are subdistantly spaced.  The sturdy [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|10|to|20|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|to|1.5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick.  The stipe is central, equal (i.e., roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom), and dark orange to yellowish.<ref name=MaasG_1991/>

The species is regarded as nonpoisonous, but is not necessarily edible.<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=134|author-link=Orson K. Miller Jr.}}</ref>

===Microscopic characteristics===
The [[spore]]s are 7–9 x 4–5&nbsp;μm, smooth, and elliptical, and weakly amyloid to inamyloid. [[Pleurocystidia]] and cheilocystidia are present.<ref name=MaasG_1991/> The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name="audu" />

===Similar species===
''[[Mycena strobilinoides]]'' is similar to ''M.&nbsp;crocea'', but is found in needle beds under conifers.  ''[[Atheniella adonis]]'' has a fragile stem and a more reddish-pink coloration.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} ''[[Atheniella aurantiidisca]]'' has a conical cap.<ref name="audu" />

==Habitat and distribution==
''Mycena crocea'' are found on hickory nuts and walnuts in eastern North America.<ref name="audu" />
