Although a prized [[edible mushroom]], it bears similarities to some deadly [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species.

==Description==
It is part of ''[[Amanita]]'' section ''Vaginatae'', and like other species in this group, it is characterized by its lack of an [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]], [[wikt:striate|striate]] [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] margin, thick [[universal veil]] remnants comprising the veil, [[Volva (mycology)|volva]], and pileus patches, [[inamyloid]] spores, and lack of  characteristic ''Amanita'' toxins such as [[amatoxins]] and [[ibotenic acid]].<ref name=tulloss/><ref name=jenkins>Jenkins DT. (1986). ''Amanita'' of North America. {{ISBN|0-916422-55-0}}</ref> It is distinguished from other species in section ''Vaginatae'' by its lack of any kind of [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] on its pileus, its short pileus [[wikt:striae|striae]], and its distinct pale orange to pale salmon coloration when young. Its coloration can become more brownish with age and entirely white specimens are occasionally seen as well.<ref name=tulloss/> Like many other ''Amanita'', the gills are white, but occasionally have a distinct pinkish or orangish tint.<ref name=tulloss/><ref name=jenkins/> In older specimens, the odor can become pungent and fishy.<ref name=arora/><ref name=rich>Rich R. (2002). [http://www.rrich.com/msamavelo.html "Amanita velosa".] ''Robert's Wild Mushroom Cookbook'' (website).</ref>

The cap is 5–15&nbsp;cm wide, convex then plane, with an orange-pink or salmon-like color; it usually has a white universal veil patch.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

=== Similar species ===
The deadly ''[[Amanita ocreata|A. ocreata]]'' and occasionally ''[[Amanita phalloides|A.&nbsp;phalloides]]'' are found in the same habitat at the same time of year as ''A.&nbsp;velosa'', and can often be found in close proximity. ''A.&nbsp;ocreata'' and ''A.&nbsp;phalloides'' have thin universal veil remnants, a sac-like volva, an annulus, a non-striate pileus margin, and a pileus that is a different color than ''A.&nbsp;velosa''.<ref name="arora" /><ref name="mykoweb" /> These differences can fade as the [[fruiting body]] ages, making it important to collect only specimens that have all of their identifying characteristics intact.<ref name=":1">Street C.

==Distribution and habitat==
''A. velosa'' is a late-season mushroom in its range of occurrence, being primarily found in the coastal regions of [[California]], [[Oregon]], and [[Baja California]],<ref name="tulloss" /> from midwinter up until the end of the California [[Wet season|rainy season]]. Its favored habitat is the [[ecotone]] between [[oak]] (particularly [[coast live oak]]) woodlands and open grassland, living in an [[ectomycorrhizal]] relationship with young oak trees.<ref name="arora" /><ref name="jenkins" /><ref name="mykoweb">Wood M, Stevens F. (2004). [http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Amanita_velosa.html ''Amanita velosa''.] ''MykoWeb'' (website).</ref>

The species is also reported to have been found in association with [[aspen]] and [[conifer]]s in the [[Sierra Nevada]],<ref name="arora" /> with one report of it being found growing with [[spruce]] in the eastern United States' [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]].<ref name="jenkins" />

==Edibility==

It is considered to be an outstanding [[Edible mushroom|edible]] species with a distinctively sweet or nutty flavor,<ref name=arora/><ref name=rich/> but great caution must be exercised to properly identify it due to its similarity to deadly species.<ref name=":1" />
