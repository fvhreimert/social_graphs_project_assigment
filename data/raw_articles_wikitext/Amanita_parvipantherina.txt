'''''Amanita parvipantherina''''', also known as the '''Asian small panther amanita''', is a Chinese species of [[agaric]] which fruits in July and August. It has a brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{Convert|6|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} wide covered with whitish remnants of the [[universal veil]]. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is up to 9&nbsp;cm tall. The similar ''[[Amanita pantherina|A. pantherina]]'' is usually larger and less fragile, with fainter striations around the cap margin.

The species is restricted to [[Yunnan]] province in China, where it is strongly associated with ''[[Pinus yunnanensis]]'' (the Yunnan pine).
