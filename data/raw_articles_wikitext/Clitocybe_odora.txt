'''''Clitocybe odora''''', commonly known as the '''blue green anise mushroom''',<ref name="Arora2nd" /> or '''aniseed toadstool''', is a blue-green [[mushroom]] that smells strongly like [[anise]]. It grows near [[deciduous]] and [[conifer]]ous trees, in small groups alongside tree roots. This mushroom is [[edible mushrooms|edible]] but may resemble [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species.

==Taxonomy==
First described by the French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Francois Pierre Bulliard]] (1742–1793). The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''odora'' is from the [[Latin]] meaning "perfumed".<ref name=GiovanniPacioni1993>{{cite book | author = Giovanni Pacioni  | year = 1993 | title = The Macdonald Encyclopedia of Mushrooms and Toadstools (English version) | publisher = Little, Brown & Company Ltd. | isbn = 0-316-90625-5}}</ref>

==Description==
Young specimens have a bell-shaped [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] with a light blue texture that fades to grey in age. The cap measures {{Convert|3-8|cm|frac=2}} wide.<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |pages=135}}</ref> Mature specimens have blue-green, cup-shaped caps with a rough surface; the [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate to decurrent and creamy white or blue-green.<ref name="Arora2nd" /> The [[spore print]] is whitish to slightly pink.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=500}}</ref>

The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is white to buff or cap-colored with no [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. It grows up to {{Convert|6|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} tall<ref name="tfb" /> and 2&nbsp;cm thick.<ref name="Arora2nd" /> The mushroom has a strong scent and taste of [[aniseed]], hence its name. The odor is due to the presence of {{nowrap|[[Anisaldehyde|''p''-anisaldehyde]]}} and a small amount of [[benzaldehyde]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Sylvie Rapior |author2=Sophie Breheret |author3=Thierry Talou |author4=Yves Pélissier |author5=Jean-Marie Bessière |name-list-style=amp |year=2002 |title=The anise-like odor of ''Clitocybe odora'', ''Lentinellus cochleatus'' and ''Agaricus essettei'' |url=http://www.mycologia.org/cgi/content/full/94/3/373 |journal=Mycologia |volume=94 |issue=3 |pages=373–376 |doi=10.1080/15572536.2003.11833201 |pmid=21156507 |s2cid=46170831|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

There is a white [[variety (botany)|variety]] (''Clitocybe odora'' var. ''alba'' [[Jakob Emanuel Lange|Lange]]) that has the same strong odour.

Outside of ''[[Clitocybe]]'', young specimens could be confused with ''[[Stropharia aeruginosa]]'', in addition to other poisonous species.<ref name=":0" />



==Distribution and habitat==
Found in both [[deciduous]], and [[conifer]]ous woods, it is widespread in the temperate zones, occurring in Asia, Europe (August to December),<ref name="tfb" /> and North America (around August to November).<ref name="audu" /> On the East Coast of North America it favours [[oak]] woodland, but it is often abundant in the coniferous forests of the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name=Arora2nd>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/161/mode/2up |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=161-162}}</ref> It grows under trees and in debris.<ref name="audu" />

==Edibility==
The caps can be dried and used as a condiment, or used fresh for flavouring.<ref name=R.Mabey>{{cite book |first1= Richard |last1= Mabey |author-link=Richard Mabey |year= 1975 |title= Food For Free, a guide to the edible wild plants of Britain |publisher= Fontana / Collins }}</ref> Mushroom hunters are advised to pick mature specimens, as the younger ones can be confused with several similar poisonous ones that grow with this mushroom. Every part of the mushroom should be examined before collecting for the table. Also, the stem and the cut cap should be checked to see if there are any fly larvae. Some guides recommend against eating the species.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=61}}</ref>
