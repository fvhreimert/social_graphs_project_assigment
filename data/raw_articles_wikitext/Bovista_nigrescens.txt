'''''Bovista nigrescens''''', commonly referred to as the '''brown puffball''' or '''black bovist''', is an [[edible mushroom|edible]] cream white or brown [[puffball]]. [[Phylogenetic]] relationships between ''Bovista nigrescens'' and species of [[Lycoperdaceae]] were established based on [[Internal transcribed spacer|ITS]] and LSU sequence data from north European taxa.<ref name="pmid18207380">{{cite journal |author=Larsson E, Jeppson M |title=Phylogenetic relationships among species and genera of Lycoperdaceae based on ITS and LSU sequence data from north European taxa |journal=Mycological Research |volume=112 |issue=Pt 1 |pages=4–22 |year=2008 |pmid=18207380 |doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2007.10.018}}</ref>

==Description==
The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of ''Bovista nigrescens'' is {{Convert|3–6|cm|frac=4}} across.<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |pages=184}}</ref> The roughly spherical fruit body is slightly pointed at the bottom. Although it lacks a sterile base, the fruit body is attached to the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] by a single [[mycelial cord]] which often breaks, leaving the fruit body free to roll about in the wind. The outer wall is white at first, but soon flakes off in large scales at [[Sexual maturity|maturity]] to expose the dark purple-brown to blackish inner wall that encloses the [[spore]] mass.<ref>Calonge, F.D.

The [[capillitium]] is highly branched with brown dendroid elements. Spores are brown and [[wikt:ovoid|ovoid]], with a diameter of 4.5–6&nbsp;[[μm]]. They are thick-walled, and nearly smooth, with a central [[oil body|oil droplet]], and a long, warted pedicel.<ref>A plain and easy account of the British fungi, with descriptions of the esculent and poisonous species, details of the principles of scientific classification, and a tabular arrangement of orders and genera.

==Habitat and distribution==
''Bovista nigrescens'' puffballs are often found in grass and pastureland. Although they are found most abundantly in late summer to autumn, they persist in old dried condition for many months. They are uncommon in most areas, but frequent in North and West Europe. They are edible when young.<ref>Hoffmann-Dennert botanischer Bilderatlas, nach dem naturlichen Pflanzensystem. Suttgart, Schweizerbart, 1911. p. 57.</ref> In addition, they are found on the ground, fields, lawns or on roadsides. Typically, they may be found at an altitude of up to {{Convert|2,500|m}}.<ref>Synopsis of the British Basidiomycetes; a descriptive catalogue of the drawings and specimens in the Department of Botany, British Museum / by [[Worthington George Smith]], F.L.S.

==Uses==
The young specimens can be halved and cooked.<ref name="tfb" />
