'''''Hypholoma capnoides''''',<ref>Kummer P (1871) ''Führ. Pilzk.

Found in both the Old and New World, it grows on decaying wood and is [[edible mushroom|edible]], though may resemble some [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species.

== Description ==

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially pale orangish-yellow, pale grey when mature, later darker purple to brown.<ref name="audu" /> The [[spore print]] is dark burgundy to brown.<ref name="audu" />

=== Similar species ===
The poisonous ''[[Hypholoma fasciculare]]'' (sulphur tuft) is more common in many areas. ''H.&nbsp;capnoides'' has greyish gills due to the dark color of its [[basidiospore|spores]], whereas sulphur tuft has greenish gills. It could also perhaps be confused with the deadly ''[[Galerina marginata]]'' or the good edible ''[[Kuehneromyces mutabilis]]''.<ref name="Gerhardt2006" />

Additionally, it resembles members of ''[[Flammula]]'' and ''[[Pholiota]]''.<ref name="audu" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
Like its poisonous relative ''[[Hypholoma fasciculare|H.&nbsp;fasciculare]]'' ('sulphur tuft'), ''H.&nbsp;capnoides'' grows in clusters on decaying wood,<ref name=":0" /> for example in tufts on old tree stumps, in North America, Europe, and Asia.<ref name=":0" />

== Edibility ==
Though edible when cooked,<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |publisher=Firefly Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |location=Buffalo, NY |page=216}}</ref><ref name="tfb" /> it could be confused with some poisonous species.
