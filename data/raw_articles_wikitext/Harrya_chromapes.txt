'''''Harrya chromapes''''', commonly known as the '''yellowfoot bolete''' or the '''chrome-footed bolete''', is a species of [[bolete]] fungus in the family [[Boletaceae]]. In its [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history, ''Harrya chromapes'' has been shuffled to several different [[genus|genera]], including ''[[Boletus]]'', ''[[Leccinum]]'', and ''[[Tylopilus]]'', and is known in field guides as a member of one of these genera. In 2012, it was transferred to the newly created genus ''[[Harrya]]'' when it was established that [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] evidence demonstrated its distinctness from the genera in which it had formerly been placed.

The [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have smooth, rose-pink [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the [[basidiospore|spore]]s mature. The thick [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The species is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association with [[deciduous]] and [[conifer]]ous trees. The mushrooms are [[edible mushroom|edible]] but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by American mycologist [[Charles Christopher Frost]] as ''Boletus chromapes''. Cataloging the bolete fungi of [[New England]], Frost published 22 new bolete species in that 1874 publication.<ref name="Frost 1874"/> [[Rolf Singer]] placed the species in ''[[Leccinum]]'' in 1947 due to the scabrous dots on the stipe,<ref name="Singer 1947"/> even though the [[spore print]] color was not typical of that genus. In 1968,  [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[Harry Delbert Thiers]] thought that ''[[Tylopilus]]'' was a more appropriate fit as they believed the pinkish-brown spore print—characteristic of that genus—to be of greater [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] significance.<ref name="Smith 1968"/> Other genera to which it has been shuffled in its taxonomic history include ''Ceriomyces'' by [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1909,<ref name="Murrill 1909"/> and ''Krombholzia'' by [[Rolf Singer]] in 1942;<ref name="Singer 1942"/> ''Ceriomyces'' and ''Krombholzia'' have since been subsumed into ''Boletus'' and ''Leccinum'', respectively.<ref name="Kirk 2008"/> Additional synonyms include ''Tylopilus cartagoensis'', described by Wolfe & Bougher in 1993,<ref name="Wolfe 1993"/> and a later combination based on this name, ''Leccinum cartagoense''.<ref name="Halling 1999"/>

[[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analysis of large-subunit [[ribosomal DNA]] and [[Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1|translation elongation factor 1α]] showed that the species belonged to a unique lineage in the family [[Boletaceae]], and the genus ''[[Harrya]]'' was circumscribed to contain both it (as the [[type species]]) and the newly described ''[[Harrya atriceps|H.&nbsp;atriceps]]''. Javan species referred to ''[[Tylopilus pernanus]]'' are [[sister group|sister]] to the ''Harrya'' lineage.<ref name="Halling 2012"/>

The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''chromapes'' is [[Latin]] for "yellow foot".<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "yellowfoot bolete"<ref name="BMS Common names"/> or the "chrome-footed bolete".<ref name="Bessette 2000"/>

The fruit bodies have [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are initially convex before flattening out in maturity, reaching diameters between {{convert|3 and 15|cm|abbr=on}}. The cap surface is dry to slightly sticky. It is initially pink to rose-colored, fading to tan or pinkish tan in maturity.<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> The cap margin may curl upward in maturity.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, and does not stain blue when it is bruised or injured (an important diagnostic feature of many bolete species). It does not have any distinct odor or taste. The pore surface is initially white before becoming pinkish to flesh-colored in age. The individual pores are circular to angular, numbering two or three per millimeter, while the tubes are {{convert|8–14|mm|1|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> Tubes near the top of the stipe are depressed and almost free from attachment.<ref name="Groves 1979"/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] measures {{convert|4–14|cm|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1–2.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick and is equal in width throughout its length, or with a slight taper in either direction. The stipe surface has a scurfy texture from scabers that are colored white, pink or reddish. The underlying surface color is white or pinkish except for the yellow base.<ref name="Bessette 2000"/>

The [[spore print]] has been reported as ranging in color from pinkish, to pinkish-brown,<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> to rosy brown, to [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]-[[fawn (color)|fawn]]. The variation in spore print color results in part from differences in moisture content when recorded.<ref name="Thiers 1971"/> The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are roughly oblong to oval, smooth, [[hyaline]] (translucent) to pale brown, and measure 11–17 by 4–5.5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> They are covered in a gelatinous sheath.<ref name="Thiers 1971"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, two- and four-spored, thin-walled, and measure 25–35 by 10–14&nbsp;μm. [[Cystidia|Pleurocystidia]] (found on the tube walls) are roughly cylindrical to fuse-shaped with rounded tips, and measure 37–50 by 5–8&nbsp;μm. Cheilocystidia (on the tube edges) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and measure 23–40 by 6–8&nbsp;μm. Caulocystidia at the top of the stipe have various shapes and dimensions of 25–45 by 10–15&nbsp;μm; at the stipe base, the caulocystidia are 30–40 by 7–23&nbsp;μm and are mostly club-shaped to roughly spherical to tear-shaped. The [[cap cuticle]] comprises a single layer of tangled [[hypha]]e that are 4–6&nbsp;μm thick.<ref name="Grund 1976"/>

Several [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|chemical tests]] can be used to confirm the identify of the mushroom. A drop of [[Iron(II) sulfate|ferrous sulfate]] (FeSO<sub>4</sub>) on the flesh turns it greenish, while [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) turns it brown. The cap cuticle turns yellow with [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>), and yellow with [[ammonium hydroxide]] (NH<sub>4</sub>OH).<ref name="Grund 1976"/>

===Similar species===
Fruit bodies of ''Harrya chromapes'' are readily identified in the field by their rosy color, bright yellow stipe base, and reddish scabers on the stipe. ''[[Tylopilus subchromapes]]'' is a similar species found in Australia.<ref name="Wolfe 1993"/> ''[[Tylopilus ballouii]]'' has a more orangish cap and lacks the distinctive chrome-yellow stipe base.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> ''[[Harrya atriceps]]'' is a closely related rare species from Costa Rica. In contrast to its more common relative, it lacks reddish color in its stipe scabers and has a black cap, although it has a similar yellow stipe base.<ref name="Halling 2012"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Harrya chromapes'' is an [[ectomycorrhiza]]l species,<ref name="Roody 2003"/> and its fruit bodies grow singly to scattered on soil. They are usually found in forests containing [[conifer]]s, [[Betulaceae]] and [[oak]] in North America. The North American distribution includes eastern Canada south to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]],<ref name="Halling 2012"/> including Mexico.<ref name="Palm 1997"/> It extends west to [[Michigan]] and [[Mississippi]].<ref name="Halling 2012"/> The fruit season extends from late spring to late summer.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> In [[Costa Rica]], where the species associates with oak, it has been recorded from the [[Cordillera Talamanca]], the [[Poás Volcano|Poás]] and [[Irazu Volcano]].<ref name="Halling 2012"/> It is also in [[Guatemala]].<ref name="Mora 2010"/> In Asia, it is known from India ([[West Bengal]]),<ref name="De 2006"/> Taiwan,<ref name="Yeh 1983"/> Japan,<ref name="Hongo 1980"/> and in China, where it associates with trees from the [[Fagaceae|beech]] and [[Pinaceae|pine]] families.<ref name="Halling 2012"/>

Fruit bodies can be [[parasitized]] by the molds ''[[Sepedonium ampullosporum]]'', ''[[Sepedonium laevigatum|S.&nbsp;laevigatum]]'', and ''[[Sepedonium chalcipori|S.&nbsp;chalcipori]]''. In ''[[Sepedonium]]'' infections, a white to powdery yellow mold covers the surface of the fruit body.<ref name="Sahr 1999"/> The mushrooms are a food source and rearing habitat for several insect species, including the [[fungus gnat]]s ''[[Mycetophila fisherae]]'' and ''[[Mycetophila signatoides|M.&nbsp;signatoides]]'', and [[fly|flies]] such as ''[[Pegomya winthemi]]'' and species of the genera ''[[Sciophila (fly)|Sciophila]]'' and ''[[Mydaea]]''.<ref name="Wheeler 1984"/> The [[cottontail rabbit]] species ''[[Sylvilagus brasiliensis]]'' has been recorded feeding on the mushrooms in Costa Rica.<ref name="Wainwright 2007"/>

==Uses==
The mushrooms are [[edible mushroom|edible]] and good, but popular with insects, and so are often infested with maggots.<ref name="Arora 1986" />
