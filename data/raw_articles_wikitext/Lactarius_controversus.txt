'''''Lactarius controversus''''', commonly known as the '''poplar milkcap''',<ref name="Arora2nd" /> is a large funnel-capped [[fungus]] within the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'', which are collectively known as 'milk caps'. They all exude milky drops (lactate) from the flesh and gills when damaged.

The species is classified as inedible but has sometimes been collected in Eurasia.

==Taxonomy==
Accredited to [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]], one of the fathers of [[mycology]].

==Description==
It is distinguishable mainly by rosy markings on the upper [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] surface, often arranged in concentric rings, and its pinkish-buff [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]]. Like other fungi in the genus, it has crumbly, rather than fibrous, flesh, and when this is broken the fungus exudes a white milky latex. Mature specimens are funnel-shaped, with [[decurrent gills]] and a concave [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] from {{convert|5 to 20|cm|frac=2}} in diameter.<ref name="Arora2nd" /> The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is up to 7&nbsp;cm long.<ref name="Arora2nd" /> The flesh is firm and the [[spore print]] is creamy to pinkish.<ref name="Arora2nd" />

=== Similar species ===
The species is similar to several white milk-caps in the genus ''[[Lactifluus]]'' which however are only distantly related: The 'fleecy milk-cap' ''[[Lactifluus vellereus]]'', its sister species ''[[Lactifluus bertillonii|L.&nbsp;bertillonii]]'', and the 'peppery milk-cap' ''[[Lactifluus piperatus|L.&nbsp;piperatus]]''<ref name="Arora2nd" /> all lack the pinkish gills and 'rosy' cap markings.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is found in Europe, including [[Great Britain|Britain]], and usually grows with species of ''[[Salix]]'' (goat willow or creeping willow) on [[heath]]s and moors. It is uncommon.<ref name="Phillips06">{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref> It is widespread in North America growing with [[aspen]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[willow]]. Found in the aspen forests of the [[Sierra Nevada]], and has been noted in [[New Mexico]].<ref name="Arora2nd">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/70/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=70-71 |orig-date=1979}}</ref>

==Edibility==
The mushroom is considered inedible due to its very acrid taste (producing a burning sensation) ,<ref name="Arora2nd" /> but is eaten and even commercially collected in southeastern European countries such as [[Serbia]] and [[Turkey]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276868135|title=Edible mycorrhizal species Lactarius controversus Pers. 1800 as a source of antioxidant and cytotoxic agents|date=January 2015|journal=Hemijska Industrija |volume=17(00):17-17|doi=10.2298/HEMIND141229017N|last1=Novakovic|first1=Aleksandra|last2=Karaman|first2=Maja|last3=Milovanovic|first3=Ivan|last4=Belovic|first4=Miona|last5=Raseta|first5=Milena|last6=Radusin|first6=Tanja|last7=Ilic|first7=Nebojsa|issue=2|pages=113–122|doi-access=free}}</ref>
