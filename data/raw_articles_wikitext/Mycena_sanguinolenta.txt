'''''Mycena sanguinolenta''''', commonly known as the '''bleeding bonnet''', the '''smaller bleeding Mycena''', or the '''terrestrial bleeding Mycena''', is a species of [[mushroom]] in the family [[Mycenaceae]]. It is a common and widely distributed species, and has been found in North America, Australia, and Eurasia. The fungus produces reddish-brown to reddish-purple [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] with conic to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|1.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} wide held by slender [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]] up to {{convert|6|cm|abbr=on}} high. When fresh, the fruit bodies will "bleed" a dark reddish-purple [[latex|sap]]. The similar ''[[Mycena haematopus|M.&nbsp;haematopus]]'' is larger and grows on decaying wood, usually in clumps. ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' contains [[alkaloid]] pigments that are unique to the species, may produce an [[antifungal]] compound, and is [[bioluminescent]]. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom has not been determined.

==Taxonomy==
First called ''Agaricus sanguinolentus'' by [[Johannes Baptista von Albertini]], the species was transferred to the genus ''[[Mycena]]'' in 1871 by German [[Paul Kummer]],<ref name=Kummer1871/> when he raised many of Fries' "tribes" to the rank of genus. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''sanguinolentus'' and means "bloody".<ref name=Wakefield1950/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "bleeding bonnet"<ref name=BMS/> the "smaller bleeding Mycena",<ref name=Roody2003/> or the "terrestrial bleeding Mycena".<ref name=Arora1986/>

The fungus is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Lactipedes'' along with other latex-producing species.<ref>Smith 1947, pp. 132–33.</ref> A [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular phylogenetic]] analysis of several dozen European ''Mycena'' species suggests that ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' is closely related to {{species|M|ycena|galopus}}. Other phylogenically related species include {{species|M|ycena|galericulata}} and {{species|M|ycena|haematopus}}.<ref name=Harder2010/>

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is either convex or conic when young, with its margin pressed against the stipe. As it expands, it becomes broadly convex or bell-shaped, ultimately reaching a diameter of {{convert|3–15|mm|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Arora1986/> The surface is initially covered with a dense whitish-grayish coating or powder that is produced by delicate microscopic cells, but these cells soon collapse and disappear, leaving the surface naked and smooth. The surface is moist with an opaque margin that soon developing furrows. The cap color is variable but always some shade of bright or dull reddish brown with a dull grayish-brown margin. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, not very fragile, sordid reddish, and exudes a reddish latex when cut. The odor and taste are not distinctive.<ref name="Smith p.146-49"/>

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] or slightly toothed, and well-spaced. They are narrow to moderately broad, sordid reddish to grayish, with even edges that are dark reddish brown. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|2–6|cm|1|abbr=on}} long, 1–1.5&nbsp;mm thick, equal in width throughout, and fragile. The base of the stipe is covered with coarse, stiff white hairs, while the remainder is covered with a drab powder that soon sloughs off to leave the stipe polished, and more or less the same color as the cap. It also exudes a bright or dull-red juice when cut or broken.<ref name="Smith p.146-49">Smith 1947, pp. 146–49.</ref> The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is unknown—but it is considered too insubstantial to be of culinary interest.<ref name=Roody2003/><ref name=Arora1986/>

The [[spore]]s are 8–10 by 4–5&nbsp;[[μm]], roughly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], and only weakly [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) four-spored (occasionally two- or three-spored). The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the face of a gill) are rare to scattered or sometimes quite abundant, narrowly to broadly [[wikt:ventricose|ventricose]], measuring 36–54 by 8–13&nbsp;μm. They are filled with a sordid-reddish substance. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are similar to the pleurocystidia or shorter and more obese, and very abundant. The flesh if the gill is made of broad hyphae the cells of which are often [[wikt:vesiculose|vesiculose]] (covered with [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicles]]) in age, and [[staining|stain]] pale reddish brown in iodine. The flesh of the cap is covered with a thin [[wikt:pellicle|pellicle]], and the hypoderm (the layer of cells immediately underneath the pellicle) is moderately well-differentiated. The remainder of the cap flesh is [[wikt:floccose|floccose]] and filamentous, and all except the pellicle stain pale [[wine (color)|vinaceous]]-brown in iodine. [[wikt:lactiferous|Lactiferous]] (latex-producing) hyphae are abundant.<ref name="Smith p.146-49"/>

===Chemistry===
The fruit bodies contain the blue [[alkaloid]] pigments, sanguinones A and B, unique to this species. It also has the red-colored alkaloid sanguinolentaquinone. The sanguinones are structurally related to mycenarubin&nbsp;A, made by ''[[Mycena rosea|M.&nbsp;rosea]]'', and the [[discorhabin]]s, a series of compounds produced by [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[sponge]]s. Although the function of the sanguinones is not known, it has been suggested that they may have "an ecological role ... beyond their contribution to the color of the fruiting bodies, ... since predators rarely feed on fruiting bodies".<ref name=Peters2007/>  When grown in [[pure culture]] in the laboratory, the fungus produces the [[antifungal]] compound {{nowrap|hydroxystrobilurin-D}}.<ref name=Backens1988/> ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' is one of over 30 ''Mycena'' species that is [[bioluminescent]].<ref name=Desjardin2008/>

===Similar species===
The other "bleeding Mycena" ({{species|M|ycena|haematopus}}) is readily distinguished from ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' by its larger size, different color, growth on rotting wood, and presence of a sterile band of tissue on the margin of the cap. Further, ''M.&nbsp;sanguinolenta'' consistently has red-edged gills, while the gill edges of ''M.&nbsp;haematopus'' are more variable.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> The similarly named {{species|M|ycena|subsanguinolenta}} has red to orange juice, is slightly yellower, and does not have pleurocystidia. {{species|M|ycena|plicatus}} has a similar furrowed cap, but also has a tough stipe and does not ooze liquid when injured.<ref name=Arora1986/> ''Mycena'' specialist [[Alexander H. Smith]] has noted a "striking" resemblance to {{species|M|ycena|debilis}}, but this species has different colors (pale vinaceous brown or sordid brown when faded), produces uncolored latex, and does not have differently-colored gill edges.<ref name=Smith1935/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Mycena sanguinolenta'' is common and widely distributed. It has been found from [[Maine]] to [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and south to [[North Carolina]] and [[California]] in the United States, and from [[Nova Scotia]] to [[British Columbia]] in Canada.<ref name="Smith p.146-49"/> In Jamaica, it has been collected at an elevation of {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Dennis1968/> The distribution includes Europe (Britain,<ref name=Hughes1957/> Germany,<ref name=Gerhardt1990/> The Netherlands,<ref name=Arnolds2009/> Norway,<ref name="urlMycena sanguinolenta"/> Romania<ref name=Silaghi1959/> and Sweden)<ref name=Ruhling1990/> and Australia.<ref name=Young2005/> In Asia, it has been collected from the [[alpine zone]] of the [[Changbai Mountains]] in [[Jilin Province, China]],<ref name=Yuguang2010/> and from the provinces of [[Ōmi Province|Ōmi]] and [[Yamashiro Province|Yamashiro]] in Japan.<ref name=Hongo1953/>

The fruit bodies grow in groups on leaf mold, moss beds, or needle carpets during the spring and fall.<ref name="Smith p.146-49"/> It is common in forests of [[fir]] and [[beech]],<ref name=Peters2007/> and prefers to grow in soil of high acidity.<ref name=Ruhling1990/>
