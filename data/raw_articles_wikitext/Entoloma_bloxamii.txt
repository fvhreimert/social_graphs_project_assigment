'''''Entoloma bloxamii''''', commonly known as the '''big blue pinkgill''',<ref name="BMS" /> is a species of [[agaric]] (gilled mushroom) in the family [[Entolomataceae]].

The species has a European distribution, occurring mainly in agriculturally unimproved grassland.<ref name="iucn2022"/> It has been reported from North America, but at least some of these reports represent a distinct species, ''[[Entoloma medianox|E.&nbsp;medianox]]''.<ref name="Schwartz"/> Threats to the habitat of ''E.&nbsp;bloxamii'' have resulted in it being assessed as globally "[[vulnerable species|vulnerable]]" on the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].<ref name="iucn2022"/>

==Taxonomy==
The species was originally [[species description|described]] from England in 1854 and named ''Agaricus Bloxami'' (sic) by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Christopher Edmund Broome]], in honour of its collector, the naturalist and clergyman [[Andrew Bloxam]]. It was transferred to the genus ''[[Entoloma]]'' by the Italian mycologist [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] in 1887.{{fact|date=May 2022}}

Recent [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] research, based on [[cladistic]] analysis of [[DNA sequences]], has shown that ''Entoloma bloxamii'' [[sensu lato]] comprises a number of distinct blue taxa in Europe,<ref name="Morgardo"/> including ''Entoloma bloxamii'' [[sensu stricto]], ''Entoloma madidum'' (previously considered a synonym), ''E.&nbsp;atromadidum'', ''E.&nbsp;ochreoprunuloides'' f. ''hyacinthinum'', and an additional as yet unnamed species.<ref name="Ainsworth"/> Collections from the west coast of North America, formerly referred to ''E.&nbsp;bloxamii'' or ''E.&nbsp;madidum'', are also distinct<ref name="Morgardo"/> and are now referred to ''[[Entoloma medianox]]''.<ref name="Schwartz"/> 

==Description==
The [[basidiocarp]]s are [[agaric]]oid, up to 4.5&nbsp;cm (1.75&nbsp;in) tall, the cap conical becoming convex to conical, up to 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) across. The cap surface is smooth, pale greyish blue at first becoming greyish brown. The [[lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] (gills) are white becoming pink from the spores. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (stem) is smooth, finely fibrillose, white with greyish blue streaks, often yellowish at the base, lacking a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[spore print]] is pink, the spores (under a microscope) multi-angled, [[inamyloid]], measuring about 7.5 to 9.5 by 7 to 9.5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Morgardo"/>

It also has smaller spores (6 to 7.5&nbsp;μm).<ref name="Morgardo"/> ''E.&nbsp;atromadidum'' is similar but a darker, indigo blue and ''E.&nbsp;ochreoprunuloides'' f. ''hyacinthinum'' is dark brown with violaceous tints.<ref name="Ainsworth"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is rare but widespread in Europe.<ref name="iucn2022"/> Like many other European pinkgills, it occurs in old, agriculturally unimproved, [[waxcap grassland|short-sward grassland]] (pastures and lawns). It is usually associated with [[Calcareous grassland|calcareous soils]] although it may also be found in more acidic areas.<ref name="Courtecuisse">Courtecuisse, R. & Duhem, B. (1995) Mushrooms and toadstools of Britain and Europe. Harper Collins, London.</ref> 

==Conservation==
''Entoloma bloxamii'' is typical of [[waxcap grassland]]s, a declining habitat due to changing agricultural practices. As a result, the species is of global conservation concern and is listed as "vulnerable" on the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].<ref name="iucn2022"/>
