'''''Hygrocybe punicea''''' is a [[species]] of [[agaric]] (gilled mushroom) in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Hygrophoraceae]]. It has been given the recommended English name of '''crimson waxcap'''.<ref name=BMS/>

The species has a European distribution, occurring mainly in agriculturally unimproved grassland. Records from East Asia, North America, and Australia require further research to see if they represent the same species.

Threats to its habitat have resulted in the species being assessed as globally "[[vulnerable species|vulnerable]]" on the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]]. It is not recommended for consumption due to its accumulating [[cadmium]]. 

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] in 1821 by Swedish [[mycologist]] [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus puniceus'', the Latin "puniceus" meaning "blood red". German mycologist [[Paul Kummer]] transferred it to the genus ''Hygrocybe'' in 1871.

Recent [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] research, based on [[cladistic]] analysis of [[DNA sequences]], has confirmed that ''Hygrocybe punicea'' belongs in ''[[Hygrocybe]]'' [[sensu stricto]].<ref name="Lodge 2014"/>

==Description==
[[Basidiocarps]] are [[agaricoid]], up to {{Convert|15|cm|frac=4}} tall, the cap convex to broadly [[umbo (mycology)|umbonate]] becoming flat, up to 15&nbsp;cm across. The cap surface is smooth, greasy to viscid, dull dark red to crimson becoming pale yellow to buff in places when dry. The [[lamella (mycology)|lamellae]] (gills) are waxy, dark red to buff with purple tints and yellowish margin. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] (stem) is smooth but fibrillose and streaky, yellow to orange-red, whitish towards base, lacking a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[spore print]] is white, the spores (under a microscope) smooth, [[inamyloid]], [[ellipsoid]], measuring about 8.5 to 10 by 4.5 to 5.5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name=Boertmann/>

===Similar species===
The north temperate ''[[Hygrocybe coccinea|H.&nbsp;coccinea]]'' (scarlet waxcap) is also scarlet, but normally much smaller and has a non-fibrillose stipe and a cap that is finely nodulose under a lens.<ref name=Boertmann/> The European ''[[Hygrocybe splendidissima]]'' (splendid waxcap) can be almost as large, but is scarlet, has a dry cap and non-fibrillose stipe, and has a distinct honey smell when rubbed or when drying.
==Distribution and habitat==
s]]
The species is widespread but generally rare throughout Europe.<ref name="iucn2022"/> Like most other European waxcaps, it occurs in old, agriculturally unimproved, [[waxcap grassland|short-sward grassland]] (pastures and lawns). 

Records from East Asia, North America (called '''scarlet waxy cap''' and occurring in woodland),<ref name="arora86" /> and Australia require further research to see if they represent the same species.<ref name="iucn2022" /> 

== Ecology ==
Recent research suggests waxcaps are neither [[mycorrhiza]]l nor [[saprotrophic]] but may be associated with mosses.<ref name="Seitzman"/>

==Conservation==
''Hygrocybe punicea'' is typical of [[waxcap grassland]]s, a declining habitat due to changing agricultural practices. As a result, the species is of global conservation concern and is listed as "vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.<ref name="iucn2022"/> ''Hygrocybe punicea'' also appears on the official or provisional national [[red list]]s of threatened fungi in several European countries, including Bulgaria,<ref name=Nationalredlist/> Croatia,<ref name=Nationalredlist/> Czech Republic,<ref name=Nationalredlist/> Denmark,<ref name=Danishredlist/> Estonia,<ref name=Nationalredlist/> Germany,<ref name=Germanredlist/> and Sweden.<ref name=Nationalredlist/>

==Toxicity==
Though sometimes claimed as edible, the [[cadmium]] it accumulates causes [[Mushroom poisoning|poisoning]] if consumed.<ref name="arora86" />
