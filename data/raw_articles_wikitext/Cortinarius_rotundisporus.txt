'''''Cortinarius rotundisporus''''', also known as the '''elegant blue webcap''', is a [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycete]] [[mushroom]] of the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'' found in southern Australia, where it is found in [[eucalypt]] forests and rainforests. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] is a steely blue colour, with a yellowish [[umbo (mycology)|boss]], and paler similarly coloured [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]].

==Taxonomy==
''Cortinarius rotundisporus'' was initially described by naturalists [[John Burton Cleland]] and [[Edwin Cheel]] in 1918. It is a member of the [[subgenus]] ''Myxacium'' within the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''; these species are characterized by the presence of a viscid to glutinous outer [[partial veil|veil]] and stipe. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] is derived from the [[Latin]] ''rotundus'' "round", and [[Ancient Greek]] ''spora'' "seed".<ref name=Clel76>{{cite book|author=Cleland JB|year =1976|orig-date=1935|title=Toadstools and mushrooms and other larger fungi of South Australia|publisher=South Australian Government Printer |pages =106}}</ref>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] ranges from 2.5 to 7&nbsp;cm (1–3&nbsp;in) in diameter, and is initially convex before flattening. It has a slight boss that is  mustard-, honey- or cream-yellow tinged and steely blue elsewhere. The adnate [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are creamy or lilac-tinged early, and darken with the [[spore]]s. The slender 5–7.5&nbsp;cm (2–3&nbsp;in) [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]; it is pale yellow or white with a tinge of the cap colour. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is yellowish and may have a lilac or pale blue tinge. The [[spore print]] is reddish brown and the oval to round spores measure 8.5&nbsp;×&nbsp;6.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name=Clel76/><ref name=Fuhrer>{{cite book|author=Fuhrer B.|year=2005|title=A Field Guide to Australian Fungi|publisher=Bloomings Books|isbn=1-876473-51-7 |page=48}}</ref> There is no particular taste or smell.
