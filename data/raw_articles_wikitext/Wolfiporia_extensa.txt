'''''Wolfiporia extensa''''' (''[[Synonym (taxonomy)|syn.]]'' '''''Poria cocos''''' F.A.Wolf), commonly known as '''hoelen''', '''poria''', '''tuckahoe''', '''China root''', '''fu&nbsp;ling''' ({{lang|zh-hant|茯苓}}, [[pīnyīn]]: fúlíng), or '''matsuhodo''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Polyporaceae]]. It is a [[wood-decay fungus]] but has a subterranean growth habit. It notably develops a large, long-lasting underground [[sclerotium]] resembling a small coconut.

== History ==
''Compendium of Materia Medica'' is firstly recorded in ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'' by [[Li Shizhen]] around the 16th century, as one of the first books to record Chinese herbs. The book recorded its medicinal application in adverse urination, edema, spleen deficiency and diarrhea. ''W.&nbsp;extensa'' is used extensively as a [[medicinal fungus|medicinal mushroom]] in [[Chinese medicine]].<ref name="Esteban 2009" /> Indications for use in the traditional Chinese medicine include promoting [[urination]], to invigorate the spleen function (i.e., digestive function), and to calm the mind.<ref name="Bensky">Bensky D, Clavey S, Stoger E. (2004) Eastland Press, Inc.  Seattle, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|0939616424}}. p. 267</ref>

== Uses ==
The tubers were reportedly eaten by some Native American tribes.<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/604/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=604 |orig-date=1979}}</ref>

=== Botanical extract ===
The species is a source of [[triterpenoid]] compounds, [[pachymic acid]], polysaccharides, choline, and histidine which has been the object of scientific study based upon the mushroom's role in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Sun |first=Yichun |date=July 2014 |title=Biological activities and potential health benefits of polysaccharides from Poria cocos and their derivatives |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.04.010 |journal=International Journal of Biological Macromolecules |volume=68 |pages=131–134 |doi=10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2014.04.010 |pmid=24751506 |issn=0141-8130|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

=== Medicinal uses ===
The [[polysaccharides]] of ''W.&nbsp;extensa'' and their derivatives have garnered significant interest due to their wide range of biological activities. These compounds exhibit potent anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiviral effects, which indicate their potential for further development as therapy or adjuvant therapy for cancer, immune modulation, and viral diseases.<ref name=":0" /> 

Besides, some polysaccharides have been found to possess [[antidepressant]] effects and have the ability to suppress the proliferation of [[T cell|T]] and {{nowrap|[[B cell]]s}}. Preliminary research indicates a potential for these [[polysaccharide]]s in the development of antidepressant or [[immunosuppressive]] agents in the food and pharmaceutical industries.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Wuxia |last2=Chen |first2=Lu |last3=Li |first3=Peng |last4=Zhao |first4=Jinzhong |last5=Duan |first5=Jinyou |date=December 2018 |title=Antidepressant and immunosuppressive activities of two polysaccharides from Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf|journal=International Journal of Biological Macromolecules |volume=120 |issue=Pt B |pages=1696–1704 |doi=10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2018.09.171 |pmid=30267822 |issn=0141-8130}}</ref>

Its main ingredients, [[triterpenoid]] compounds, exhibit significant pharmacological properties such as anti-diabetic and tonic medicine. Particularly, specific components like [[pachymic acid]], {{Nowrap|3-epidehydrotumulosic}} acid, and polyporenic acid&nbsp;C have been shown to significantly increase [[hypoglycemic]] activity, which is traditionally used in treating hyperglycemic disorders like [[diabetes]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Yu-Chuan |last2=Chang |first2=Wen-Liang |last3=Huang |first3=Su-Fen |last4=Lin |first4=Cheng-Yu |last5=Lin |first5=Hang-Ching |last6=Chang |first6=Tsu-Chung |date=December 2010 |title=Pachymic acid stimulates glucose uptake through enhanced GLUT4 expression and translocation|journal=European Journal of Pharmacology |volume=648 |issue=1–3 |pages=39–49 |doi=10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.08.021 |pmid=20816811 |issn=0014-2999}}</ref>

In addition, triterpenoids from ''W.&nbsp;extensa'' have been also found to demonstrate significant diuretic activity in rats. Specifically, tetracyclic triterpenoids from ''W.&nbsp;extensa'' are aldosterone antagonists that can bind to renal cytoplasmic aldosterone receptors. This action enhances the urinary Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ratio in rats and inhibits the Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup> [[ATPase]] in the kidney and erythrocytes, which reduce the reabsorption of crude urine, leading to increased urine excretion, as diuresis application.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=HU |first1=Gao-Sheng |last2=HUANG |first2=Chong-Gui |last3=ZHANG |first3=Yang |last4=XIAO |first4=Wei |last5=JIA |first5=Jing-Ming |date=April 2017 |title=Accumulation of biomass and four triterpenoids in two-stage cultured Poria cocos mycelia and diuretic activity in rats |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S1875-5364(17)30043-2 |journal=Chinese Journal of Natural Medicines |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=265–270 |doi=10.1016/s1875-5364(17)30043-2 |pmid=28527511 |issn=1875-5364|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

A novel immunomodulatory glycoprotein from ''W.&nbsp;extensa'' is demonstrated to be capable of activating murine macrophages, cells that play a crucial role in the body's defense against diseases, such as [[bacterial infections]] and [[tumor cells]] involved in tumor lysis and growth inhibition. This suggests its immunomodulatory effects as a herbal remedy.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Chang |first1=Hui-Hsin |last2=Yeh |first2=Chen-Hao |last3=Sheu |first3=Fuu |date=2009-07-22 |title=A Novel Immunomodulatory Protein from Poria cocos Induces Toll-like Receptor 4-Dependent Activation within Mouse Peritoneal Macrophages |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jf9011399 |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry |language=en |volume=57 |issue=14 |pages=6129–6139 |doi=10.1021/jf9011399 |pmid=19548679 |bibcode=2009JAFC...57.6129C |issn=0021-8561|url-access=subscription }}</ref>

Modern pharmacological studies suggest multiple neurological benefits associated with the use of ''W.&nbsp;extensa''. For instance, the aqueous extract has been found to improve long-term potentiation in the [[hippocampus]] of rats and ameliorate [[scopolamine]]-induced spatial memory impairment. Furthermore, it is a key ingredient in many [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese medicinal]] formulas used to manage neurodegenerative diseases.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Jiang |first1=Xia |last2=Hu |first2=Zhaotun |last3=Qiu |first3=Xiaoyan |last4=Wu |first4=Liming |last5=Zhou |first5=Rong |last6=Yang |first6=Yaoyao |last7=Xiang |first7=Xiaoliang |date=January 2023 |title=Poria cocos (Schw.)

In Chinese medicine, ''W.&nbsp;extensa'' is commonly used for the treatment of primary [[dysmenorrhea]]. It is known for its clinical efficacy in activating blood circulation to dissipate blood stasis.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sun |first1=Lan |last2=Liu |first2=Lina |last3=Zong |first3=Shaobo |last4=Wang |first4=Zhengzhong |last5=Zhou |first5=Jun |last6=Xu |first6=Zhiliang |last7=Ding |first7=Gang |last8=Xiao |first8=Wei |last9=Kou |first9=Junping |date=September 2016 |title=Traditional Chinese medicine Guizhi Fuling capsule used for therapy of dysmenorrhea via attenuating uterus contraction|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume=191 |pages=273–279 |doi=10.1016/j.jep.2016.06.042 |pmid=27340106 |issn=0378-8741}}</ref>
