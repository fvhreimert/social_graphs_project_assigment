'''''Bridgeoporus''''' is a fungal [[genus]] in the family [[Polyporaceae]]. A [[monotypic]] genus, it contains the single [[polypore]] species '''''Bridgeoporus nobilissimus''''', first [[species description|described]] to science in 1949. Commonly known both as the '''noble polypore''' and the '''fuzzy Sandozi''', this fungus produces large [[Sporocarp (fungi)|fruit bodies]] (or [[bracket fungus|conks]]) that have been found to weigh up to {{convert|130|kg|lb}}. The upper surface of the fruit body has a fuzzy or fibrous texture that often supports the growth of [[alga]]e, [[bryophyte]]s, or [[vascular plant]]s.

This species is found in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America where it grows on large (at least 1&nbsp;m diameter) specimens of [[noble fir]] (''Abies procera''), [[Pacific silver fir]] (''Abies amabilis''), or [[western hemlock]] (''Tsuga heterophylla''). ''Bridgeoporus nobilissimus'' causes a [[Wood-decay fungus|brown rot]] in its tree hosts. Genetic analysis shows that the fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates.

==Taxonomy==
''Bridgeoporus nobilissimus'' was named for [[William Bridge Cooke]], who originally [[species description|described]] the species as ''Oxyporus nobilissimus'' in 1949. The fungus was discovered in [[Clackamas County, Oregon]], in 1943 by brothers Ali and Fred Sandoz. Foresters called the species ''Fomes fuzzii-sandozii'', referring to the collectors and the fuzzy surface texture of the conk. Several collections were made in [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in subsequent years. A large specimen was collected in [[Lewis County, Washington]] in 1946 that weighed about {{convert|300|lb}} and measured {{convert|56|in|cm}} by {{convert|37|in|cm}}. Cooke learned of the fungus in 1948 while visiting [[Daniel Elliot Stuntz]], who kept one of the large fruit bodies that he and [[Alexander H. Smith]] had previously collected in [[Mount Rainier National Park]]. This fruit body served as the [[type (biology)|type]] collection.<ref name="Cooke 1949"/>

Species of genus ''[[Oxyporus]]'' cause [[white rot]] in their host trees. Cooke placed the fungus in this genus by despite not knowing definitively what type of rot it caused; he considered it to be closely related to ''[[Oxyporus populinus]]''.<ref name="Cooke 1949"/> In 1955, polypore specialist [[Josiah Lincoln Lowe]] transferred ''O.&nbsp;nobilissimus'' to ''[[Fomes]]'',<ref name="Lowe 1955"/> before the concept of this genus was narrowed. In 1996 the new genus ''Bridgeoporus'' was [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] by Harold Burdsall, Tom Volk and Joseph Ammirati to accommodate this species, in order to rectify incompatibilities with placements in ''Fomes'' and ''Oxyporus''. In particular, genus ''Oxyporus'' features true [[cystidia]] arising from the subhymenium (the supportive [[hypha]]e underlying the [[hymenium]]), whereas ''B.&nbsp;nobilissimus'' has pseudocystidia (sterile structures arising deep in the subhymenium and protruding into the hymenium).<ref name="Burdsall 1996"/>

[[Phylogenetic]] analyses of [[mitochondria]]l small-subunit [[ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] sequences suggests that ''B.&nbsp;nobilissimus'', which belongs in the hymenochaetoid [[cladistics|clade]], is closely related to the genera ''Oxyporus'' and ''[[Schizopora]]''.<ref name="Redberg 2003"/> The hymenochaetoid clade includes [[wood-decay fungi|wood-decaying]] species previously [[classification (biology)|classified]] variously in the families [[Corticiaceae]], [[Polyporaceae]] and [[Stereaceae]].<ref name="Larsson 2006"/>

==Description==

''Bridgeoporus nobilissimus'' has [[perennial]], [[wikt:imbricate|imbricate]], [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]] fruit bodies that measure {{convert|30|–|140|cm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|25|–|95|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=8}} by {{convert|30|–|100|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Redberg 2003"/> From 1966 to 1990, this species was designated the largest pore fungus in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]''.<ref name="FEMAT 1993"/> Three fruit body shapes are associated with the fungus, depending largely on the location of the fruiting on the host tree.  Hoof-shaped and shelf-like conks are located on the sides of hosts; short, oblong-topped conks with tapering pore surfaces occur on the main roots of the host; and centrally substipitate (conical) conks are found on the tops of stumps.<ref name="Redberg 2003"/> The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] surface of young fruit bodies are covered with a dense mat of white [[mycelial]] fibers (up to several millimeters long) that in age darken in color and often become stuck together at their tips. Although the surface is typically brown or darker, it may appear green due to [[epiphytic]] associations with [[alga]]e such as ''[[Coccomyxa]]'' or ''[[Charicium]]'' species.<ref name="Redberg 2003"/> [[Bryophyte]]s or sometimes [[vascular plant]]s grow on the upper surface of the conk. The texture of the fruit body is fibrous; it is rubbery and tough when fresh, but becomes hard and brittle when it is dry. The pores on the underside of the fruit body are round, approximately 2 per [[millimeter|mm]]. The tubes comprising the pores becomes stratified, layering over each other with each successive year of growth. There is a 2–3&nbsp;mm-thick layer of sterile tissue between pore layers, and mature tube layers are 2–7&nbsp;mm long.<ref name="Burdsall 1996"/>

Microscopically, ''B.&nbsp;nobilissimus'' is characterized by hyphae with a [[septum]], pseudocystidia originating from the [[trama (mycology)|trama]], closely [[wikt:appressed|appressed]] hyphae in bundles (fascicles) on the upper surface of the fruit body. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are 12–18 by 4–10&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] in size, pear-shaped, and four-spored. The roughly [[wikt:ovoid|ovoid]] [[basidiospore]]s are 5.5–6.5 by 3.5–4.5&nbsp;μm, [[hyaline]], smooth, and have thin walls.<ref name="Burdsall 1996"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
The fruit bodies (also called conks) of ''Bridgeoporus'' are found singly or sometimes in overlapping layers on old trees ({{convert|1|–|2|m|ft|abbr=on|frac=12}} diameter at breast height) of [[noble fir]] (''Abies procera''), and more rarely [[Pacific silver fir]] (''Abies amabilis'') or [[western hemlock]] (''Tsuga heterophylla'').<ref name="Castellano 1999"/> It has also been recorded growing on a [[snag (ecology)|snag]] of [[redwood]].<ref name="Gordon 2015"/> Other tree species often found in  ''B.&nbsp;nobilissimus'' habitats include [[Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii''), [[western redcedar]] (''Thuja plicata''), and western hemlock. Common shrubs at these sites include [[salal]] (''Gaultheria shallon''), [[Sitka alder]] (''Alnus sinuata''), [[rhododendron]] (''Rhododendron macrophyllum''), and [[Alaska blueberry]] (''Vaccinium ovalifolium'').<ref name="Fennell 2008"/> The use of molecular genetic techniques has demonstrated that the fungus also lives in Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western redcedar, although its fruit bodies have not been seen on these hosts.<ref name="Gordon 2015"/>

The fungus has been found in the [[Cascade Range]] in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and Oregon, the [[Pacific Coast Ranges|Coast Range]] on the [[Olympic Peninsula, Washington|Olympic Peninsula]] in Washington, and in [[Redwood National Park]] in [[northern California]].<ref name="Gordon 2015"/> Specimens have been found at elevations of {{convert|1000|–|4000|ft|m}}.<ref name="Castellano 1999"/> Because the fungus feeds on both dead and living wood,<ref name="Fennell 2008"/> it is both [[parasitism|parasitic]] and [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophytic]].<ref name="Burdsall 1996"/> ''B.&nbsp;nobilissimus'' fruit bodies do not occur on fallen logs or other forms of dead wood lacking roots or some connection to a root system. Conks have been found growing on the still-living roots of an upturned, [[windthrow]]n tree, while a once-living conk died within several years after the host tree was uprooted by a fallen tree.<ref name="Ledo 2007"/>

==Conservation==
Threats to ''Bridgeoporus nobilissimus'' include [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of known and unknown habitats by [[logging]], fire, or other disturbances, and [[forestry]] practices that lead to the loss of large-diameter ''Abies procera'' and ''Abies amabilis'' trees and large-diameter stumps and snags in [[Sustainable forest management|managed forests]].<ref name="Ledo 2007"/> Due to the scarcity of its mature tree hosts, ''B.&nbsp;nobilissimus'' was listed in 1995 as an [[endangered species]] by the Oregon Natural Heritage Program, making it the first of the fungi to be listed as endangered by any private or public agency in the United States.<ref name="Lizon 1995"/><ref name="urlFotM June 1997"/> It is the sole fungus in category''&nbsp;''A of the survey and management guidelines for fungi under the [[Northwest Forest Plan]], meaning pre-disturbance surveys and site management are needed before developing areas known to harbor the fungus.<ref name="USDA 2001"/> There were 13 known sites with the fungus before 1998; extensive surveying in the [[Pacific Northwest]] increased this number to 103 sites by 2006.<ref name="Molina 2008"/> Although it is infrequently observed, the fungus is more abundant than fruit body appearance indicates. Using genetic markers to detect the fungus mycelium in hosts, researchers found that ''B.&nbsp;nobilissimus'' was present at low to moderate levels and widespread in [[Stand level modelling|forest stands]] containing at least a single visible fruit body. It was detected in trees of all sizes, and in species not previously thought to harbor the fungus. ''B.&nbsp;nobilissimus'' may require decades of mycelial growth in its host before fruit body production is initiated. The fungus has not been successfully grown [[in vitro]] despite several attempts.<ref name="Gordon 2015"/>
