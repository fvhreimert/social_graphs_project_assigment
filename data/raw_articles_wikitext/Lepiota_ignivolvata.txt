'''''Lepiota ignivolvata''''', sometimes known commonly as the '''orange-girdled parasol''', is a fairly rare member of the gilled [[mushroom]] genus ''[[Lepiota]]''.<ref name=Phillips06/> It is among the larger species in this group, growing in [[coniferous]] or [[deciduous]] woodland during autumn; it has a primarily European distribution. Being inedible, and perhaps poisonous, it should not be gathered for culinary use. Many of the species in this genus are deadly.

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is between {{convert|4|and|10|cm|in}} in diameter. It is convex, later flat, and with a raised central boss (umbo). The centre of the cap is reddish brown, or orange-brown, breaking into small scales, which are fewer, and lighter towards the margin.<ref name=Phillips06/> The best identification aid is the orange (somewhat indented) [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]], which is low on the white, slightly bulbous to club-shaped [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]],<ref name=T.Laessoe/> which often has an orange flush at its base.

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white to cream, giving a white [[spore print]].<ref name=Phillips06/>  They are free of the stem, and are fairly crowded together. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white throughout, and has an unpleasant chemical smell, similar to that which is produced when cutting metal;<ref name=T.Laessoe/> the odor has also been compared to rubber.<ref name="urlLepiota ignivolvata"/> ''L. ignivolvata'' has an unpleasant, rancid taste.<ref name="urlLepiota ignivolvata"/> The spores are spindle ([[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]]) or almond (amygdaloid) in shape, with dimensions of 9&ndash;13 to 5&ndash;7; [[micrometre|μm]].<ref name="urlLepiota ignivolvata"/>

The similar species ''Lepiota ventriosospora'' and ''Lepiota cristata'' lack the orange colouring on the ring.

''Lepiota ignivolvata'' belongs to the section ''Fusisporae'' within genus ''Lepiota'', whose members are characterized by long spindle-shaped spores and a fluffy stem beneath the ring.<ref name="Courtecuisse 2013"/>

==Naming history==
This species was originally described by [[Marcel Josserand]] and M. Bousset in 1948 in the French language in the quarterly bulletin of the [[Société mycologique de France|French Mycological Society]].<ref name=Joss1/>  However at that time the nomenclatural rules demanded a description in Latin, and so the species did not officially exist until when in 1972 the same two authors republished with a short Latin text in the monthly bulletin of the "Société linnéenne de Lyon" (Linnaean Society of Lyon).<ref name=Joss2/>  For this reason the full correct author designation is "Bousset & Joss. ex Joss."<ref name=SF1/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Lepiota ignivolvata'' is widespread across [[Europe]], its stronghold being in central to southern Europe.<ref name=T.Laessoe/>  In [[Great Britain|Britain]] it is rare, and resides on the British Red Data list. It appears in [[deciduous]], and [[coniferous]] woods, in autumn, and seems to favour [[beech]].
