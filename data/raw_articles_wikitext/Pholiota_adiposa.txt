}}'''''Pholiota adiposa''''' is a slimy, scaly, yellow-brown mushroom. It is found in North America and Eurasia. It grows parasitically or saprotrophically, most often on beech species, fruiting in bunches between August and November. Several compounds produced by this mushroom, for example methyl gallate, are of interest for their medicinal properties.

== Taxonomy ==
It was originally [[species description|described]] by German naturalist [[August Batsch]] in 1786 as a species of ''[[Agaricus]]''.<ref name="Batsch 1786" /> [[Paul Kummer]] transferred it to the genus ''[[Pholiota]]'' in 1871.<ref name="Kummer 1871" />

The name ''adiposa'' comes from the slimy, oily appearance of the cap.

== Description ==
The mushroom is fasciculate, meaning it grows in bunches. The cap is up to {{Convert|9.5|cm|frac=4}} wide, yellow to orangish<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |page=676}}</ref> with dark, concentrically arranged scales.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Holec |first=Jan |date=1998 |title=The Taxonomy of Pholiota aurivella and Pholiota adiposa - a return to Batsch and Fries |url=http://www.czechmycology.org/_cm/CM50306.pdf |journal=Czech Mycology |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=201–222|doi=10.33585/cmy.50306 }}</ref> The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded and yellow to brown colored.<ref name=":0" /> The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is up to {{Convert|12|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long,<ref name="audu" /> cylindrical, and broadening slightly at the base.<ref name=":0" /> The [[spore print]] is brown.<ref name="audu" />

=== Methyl gallate ===
''P. adiposa'' is the first fungus from which methyl gallate has been extracted.<ref name=":3" /> Methyl gallate has been studied for its antioxidant and related {{nowrap|[[HIV-1]]}} treatment properties. Antioxidants isolated from natural sources are desired due to their generally low cytotoxicity. Methyl Gallate was shown to preferentially scavenge superoxide (O<sup>2-</sup>) ions, which have been hypothesized to be involved in [[Long terminal repeat|HIV-LTR]] activation.<ref name=":3" />

=== Polysaccharides ===
Various [[polysaccharide]]s isolated from ''P. adiposa'' have been shown to have anti tumor effects in mice. One dubbed SPAP2-1 interfered with the cell cycle and induced apoptosis in [[HeLa]] cells.<ref name=":7" /> Another called PAP-1a was combined with gold [[nanoparticle]]s, increasing the [[macrophage]] count in mice.<ref name=":6" /> Other polysaccharides have been isolated which exhibit antioxidant effects.<ref name=":4" /> An overview of the literature on ''P. adiposa'' polysaccharides has suggested their antitumor abilities are closely tied to their antioxidant abilities.<ref name=":5" />
