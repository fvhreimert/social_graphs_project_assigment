'''''Phellodon secretus''''' is a rare species of [[tooth fungus]] in the family [[Bankeraceae]], described in 2003. The fungus has a distinctive growth [[habit (biology)|habit]], typically emerging in sheltered spaces beneath fallen [[pine]] trunks or [[rootstock]]s with only a few centimetres of gap between the soil and decayed wood. Its small, slender [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] feature thin, cottony soft [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that are initially white with an ash-grey tint, becoming darker with age, and bear slender white to greyish spines on their underside. Originally found in [[old-growth forest|old-growth]] pine woodlands in Finland, the species has since been recorded in England and detected through [[environmental DNA]] in several other countries, suggesting a wider [[Holarctic]] distribution.

==Description==

''Phellodon secretus'' has a distinctive growth [[habit (biology)|habit]], typically emerging in sheltered spaces beneath fallen [[pine]] trunks or rootstocks, with only a few centimetres of gap between the soil and decayed wood. The [[basidiocarp]]s (fruiting bodies) initially emerge from the [[humus]] as thin, needle-like black [[stipe (mycology)|mycology]] about 1&nbsp;mm in diameter. The cap ([[pileus (mycology)|pileus]]) only begins to develop after the stipe makes contact with the overhanging wood surface above.<ref name="Niemelä 2003"/>

The mature fruiting body is small, slender and fragile. The pileus is plane or funnel-shaped, sometimes irregularly roundish and lobed, measuring 0.9–3&nbsp;cm (occasionally up to 5.5&nbsp;cm) in diameter. It is thin (0.3–1.5&nbsp;mm, rarely up to 3.5&nbsp;mm) and cottony soft throughout. Young specimens are white with an ash-grey tint, while older specimens become darker grey or develop a sepia hue. The pileus is evenly coloured in young specimens, becoming paler towards the margin in older ones, but lacks the zonation pattern seen in some related species.<ref name="Niemelä 2003"/>

The lower surface of the pileus bears slender, sharp [[hymenium|hymenial]] spines that are initially white but later become light greyish-white. These spines are regular, dense, 0.3–0.9&nbsp;mm long (occasionally up to 1.5&nbsp;mm) and 0.06–0.12&nbsp;mm in diameter at the base. The stipe is black, glabrous (smooth), very thin (0.3–1.8&nbsp;mm, rarely up to 2.3&nbsp;mm) and of even thickness, reaching 10–18&nbsp;mm in length. It becomes brittle when dried. Fresh specimens are odourless, while dried specimens emit a very faint spicy scent. The flesh turns [[olivaceous]] (pale brownish green) when treated with [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) solution. Microscopically, ''P.&nbsp;secretus'' has a [[monomitic]] hyphal system with simple-[[septum|septate]] hyphae (lacking [[clamp connection]]s). The [[basidiospore]]s are roughly spherical (globose), thin-walled, [[hyaline]] (colourless), and measure 2.9–3.3 by 2.7–3&nbsp;μm. They bear small spines and have a distinct oblique apiculus.<ref name="Niemelä 2003"/>

''Phellodon secretus'' closely resembles ''[[Phellodon connatus]]'' but differs in having a thinner stipe, cottony soft pileus, and smaller, more globose spores. In its ecology and distribution, it shows similarities to ''[[Hydnellum gracilipes]]''.<ref name="Niemelä 2003"/>

The species appears to be [[mycorrhizal]], forming symbiotic relationships with trees. It is extremely rare, found primarily in dry, old-growth pine woodlands in the Northern boreal and Middle boreal vegetation zones of Finland, particularly in areas with a fairly continental climate.<ref name="Niemelä 2003"/>

===Similar species===

Other members of the genus can be confused with ''Phellodon secretus''. For example, ''[[Phellodeon tomentosus|P.&nbsp;tomentosus]]'' is typically larger, with a brown‑coloured pileus marked by concentric zones, whereas both ''[[Phellodon niger|P.&nbsp;niger]]'' and ''[[Phellodon confluens|P.&nbsp;confluens]]'' bear a more conspicuous woolly (tomentose) covering on the stipe and produce basidiospores that are appreciably larger than those of ''P.&nbsp;secretus''.<ref name="Ryvarden 2024"/>

==Habitat and distribution==

In its original description, ''P.&nbsp;secretus'' was noted as strictly associated with old‑growth ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'' woodlands, growing in the narrow gap between humus and fallen pine trunks or kelo rootstocks.<ref name="Niemelä 2003"/> British records come from ''[[Castanea sativa]]''–pine mixed stands at two [[Fagaceae]]‑associated hydnoid hotspots (Buttersteep and Rapley 2–4) in [[Swinley Forest]], [[Berkshire]].<ref name="Wainhouse et al. 2024"/> Fruiting bodies were found beneath chestnut [[plant litter]] on low [[moss]]y mounds, often close (≤ 10&nbsp;m) to [[Scots pine]]; lifting overlying wood sometimes broke the stipe, leaving the pileus attached to the wood above.<ref name="Wainhouse et al. 2024"/>

Below‑ground, soil [[environmental DNA|eDNA]] sampling detected ''P.&nbsp;secretus'' in three quadrats at each of the two sites, plus a further quadrat 750&nbsp;m away on Mill pond embankment, indicating a wider [[mycelium|mycelial]] presence than fruiting bodies alone reveal.<ref name="Wainhouse et al. 2024"/>
Although no further records have yet appeared outside Finland and England, identical or near‑identical barcodes have since been reported from Estonia, Portugal and Russia, and a mycorrhizal root tip from [[California]] (''[[Pinus muricata]]'') indicates a [[Holarctic]] distribution.<ref name="Wainhouse et al. 2024"/>
