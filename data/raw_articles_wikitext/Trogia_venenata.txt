This is the presumed cause of [[Yunnan sudden death syndrome]].

In December 2012 it was announced that Dr. Xu Jianping (徐建平) has been collecting samples of ''Trogia venenata'' in Yunnan for the past three years, and his research now shows that [[barium]] (previously thought to be the cause) levels in the wild mushroom are no higher than those of common foods such as [[poultry]] and [[fish]]. <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xu | first1 = J. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = Y. | last3 = Li | first3 = Y. | last4 = Wu | first4 = G. | last5 = Feng | first5 = B. | last6 = Yoell | first6 = S. |last7 = Zhang | first7 = K.|year = 2012 |title = Evidence against Barium in the Mushroom Trogia venenata as a Cause of Sudden Unexpected Deaths in Yunnan, China|url = https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/aem.01798-12 |journal = ASM Journals |volume = 78 |issue = 24 |pages = 8834–8835 |doi = 10.1128/AEM.01798-12| pmid = 23042168| pmc = 3502919 }}</ref>

Nonetheless, it appears the mushroom will still likely play a role. Since publication of the widely circulated 2010 Science article, no instances of Yunnan sudden death syndrome have been reported.
