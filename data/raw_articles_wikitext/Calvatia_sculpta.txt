'''''Calvatia sculpta''''', commonly known as the '''sculpted puffball''', the '''sculptured puffball''', the '''pyramid puffball''', or '''Sierran puffball''', is a species of [[puffball]] fungus in the family [[Agaricaceae]].

Attaining dimensions of up to {{convert|8 to 15|cm|abbr=on|round=0.5}} tall by {{convert|8 to 10|cm|abbr=on|round=0.5}} wide, the pear- or egg-shaped puffball is readily recognizable because of the large pyramidal or polygonal warts covering its surface. The [[basidiospore|spores]] are roughly spherical and have wart-like projections on their surfaces. It may be easily confused with ''[[Calbovista subsculpta]]'', a similar puffball that—in addition to differences observable only with a [[microscope]]—is larger, and has slightly raised warts with a felt-like texture. Other similar species include ''[[Calvatia arctica]]'' and immature specimens of ''[[Amanita magniverrucata]]''.

Originally described from the [[Sierra Nevada]], ''C.&nbsp;sculpta'' is found in mountainous areas in western North America, and was found in a Brazilian dune in 2008. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]] when young, before the spores inside the [[sporocarp (fungi)|fruit body]] disintegrate into a brownish powder. 

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1885 by American mycologist [[Harvey Willson Harkness]], under the name ''Lycoperdon sculptum''. Harkness, who called it "a curious and strikingly beautiful species", found fruit bodies growing at elevations between {{convert|6000 and 8000|ft|m|sp=us}} in the [[Sierra Nevada]] mountains. Although he noted that "in appearance it differs so much from any species known to us, as to be almost deemed worthy of generic rank", he thought that placement in the puffball genus ''[[Lycoperdon]]'' was the most appropriate [[classification (biology)|classification]], despite its unusual [[cortex (botany)|cortex]].<ref name=Harkness1885/> Harkness's type collections were destroyed in the fires following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].<ref name="Setchell 1908"/> In 1904, [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] considered the species better placed in ''[[Calvatia]]'', because of the resemblance of its deeply colored capillitial threads (coarse thick-walled cells found in the [[gleba]]) to those of ''Calvatia caelata'';{{refn|Depending on the authority consulted, ''Calvatia caelata'' is currently known as either ''Lycoperdon utriforme'',<ref name="urlFungorum: Calvatia caelata"/> ''Calvatia utriformis'',<ref name="urlMycoBank: Calvatia caelata"/> or ''[[Handkea utriformis]]''.<ref name=Kreisel1989/>|group=nb}} he called the species ''Calvatia sculptum''.<ref name=Lloyd1904/> The mushroom is known by several [[common name]]s, including the "sculpted puffball", the "sculptured puffball", the "pyramid puffball",<ref name=Bessette1992/> and the "Sierran puffball".<ref name=Arora1986/>

In 1992, German mycologist [[Hanns Kreisel]], in his survey of the genus ''Calvatia'', defined the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Sculpta'' to contain ''C.&nbsp;sculpta'' and ''C.&nbsp;subcretacea''.<ref name=Kreisel1992/> Two years later he merged the section ''Cretacea'' into ''Sculpta''<ref name=Kreisel1994/> when it was shown that ''C.&nbsp;subcretacea'' was [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with the arctic-alpine species ''[[Calvatia arctica|C.&nbsp;arctica]]''.<ref name=Lange1994/>

==Description==
[[image:Calvatia sculpta 47702.jpg|thumb|left|The [[gleba]] of young fruit bodies are firm and yellowish-white.]]

The white pear- or egg-shaped [[sporocarp (fungus)|fruit body]] of ''C.&nbsp;sculpta'' may be {{convert|8 to 15|cm|abbr=on|round=0.5}} tall by {{convert|8 to 10|cm|abbr=on|round=0.5}} wide. The outer layer of tissue, known as the exoperidium, is covered on the outer surface with distinctive long, pointed, pyramid-shaped warts, either erect or bent over and sometimes connected at the tip with other warts.<ref name=Miller2006/> The warts bear parallel horizontal lines towards the base. Mycologist [[David Arora]] opined that ''C.&nbsp;sculpta'' resembles "a&nbsp;cross between a geodesic dome and a giant glob of meringue".<ref name=Arora1986/> In age, the [[peridium]] sloughs off and exposes a brownish [[spore mass]]. The interior of the puffball, the [[gleba]], is firm and yellowish-white when young, but gradually becomes powdery and deep olive-brown as it matures.<ref name=Miller2006/>

The [[basidiospore|spores]] are roughly spherical, thick-walled, 3–6&nbsp;[[μm]] in diameter (although some specimens collected in the US range from 7.2 to 9.5&nbsp;μm),<ref name=Baseia2008/> and are covered with minute spines or warts.<ref name=McKnight1987/> The use of [[scanning electron microscopy]] has revealed that these ornamentations on the spores are typically 0.95&nbsp;μm long. Spore [[ultrastructure]] is distinctive among ''Calvatia'' species, and has been used to help verify taxonomic groupings and confirm the status of species within the genus.<ref name=Portman1997/> The capillitia (coarse, thick-walled [[hypha]]e in the gleba) are [[septate]], with branches that are narrowed towards the tips; they are 3–8&nbsp;μm in diameter.<ref name=McKnight1987/> When grown in [[pure culture]] in the laboratory, ''C.&nbsp;sculpta'' is, under certain conditions, able to grow structures called ''mycelial strands''. These are linear aggregates of hyphae whereby older "leading" hyphae become enclosed by coiled layers of newer "tendril" hyphae. Mycelial strands provide a conduit for transporting water and nutrients across non-nutrient material, allowing the fungus to reach new sources of food.<ref name=Hudson1992/> They are also implicated in the formation of fruit bodies and [[sclerotia]]. The mycelia of ''C.&nbsp;sculpta'' can be induced to form mycelial strands when there is a permeable physical barrier between it and the [[agar plate|agar]] substrate.<ref name=Bellotti1980/> The wide hyphae in the center of the mycelial strands contain protein-dense structures on their cell walls that are shaped like a [[torus]]. Their function is unknown.<ref name=Rose1982/>

===Edibility===
''Calvatia sculpta'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]] and said to be "choice" by some authors.<ref name=Arora1986/><ref name=Miller2006/> The taste is described as "mild" and the flesh has no distinguishable odor.<ref name=Miller2006/> Arora recommends eating the puffball only when it is firm and white inside, as older specimens may have a distasteful [[iodine]]-like flavor.<ref name=Arora1991/> The puffball may be preserved by freezing fresh or partially cooked slices, but their flavor and texture will deteriorate unless cooked immediately after thawing. Recommended cooking techniques for puffball slices include [[sautéing]] and coating in [[batter (cooking)|batter]] before frying.<ref name=Bessette1992/> ''C.&nbsp;sculpta'' was used as a traditional food of the [[Plains and Sierra Miwok]] Indians of North America, who called the fungus ''potokele'' or ''patapsi''.<ref name="Anderson 2013"/> Puffballs were prepared by drying them in the sun, grinding them with a mortar, and boiling them before eating with acorn soup.<ref name=Barrett1933/><ref name=Burk1983/>

The giant western puffball, ''[[Calvatia booniana]]'', is much larger than ''C.&nbsp;sculpta''—up to {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} tall—and has a smoother surface.<ref name="urlCalvatia booniana (MushroomExpert.Com)"/> Mature specimens of ''Calvatia arctica'' (synonymous with ''Calvatia subcretacea'', ''Gastropila subcretacea'', and ''Handkea subcretacea'')<ref name="urlMycoBank: Gastropila subcretacea"/><ref name=Lange1994/> can resemble immature specimens of ''C.&nbsp;sculpta''. It is distinguished from ''C.&nbsp;sculpta'' by its tough, thicker [[peridium|peridial]] wall,<ref name=McKnight1987/> and its scales are tipped with gray-brown.<ref name=Bessette1987/> ''[[Calbovista subsculpta]]'' is similar in appearance, but has more flattened and less prominent pyramidal warts. Microscopically, its capillitia are thin-walled and frequently and irregularly branched, in contrast to the thick-walled infrequently branched capillitia of ''C.&nbsp;sculpta''.<ref name=Miller2006/> The "possibly toxic" ''[[Amanita magniverrucata]]'', in its [[Embryo#Embryos of plants and animals|embryonic stage]], has a superficial resemblance as it also has pyramidal cap warts. However, it grows at different elevations and different seasons than ''C.&nbsp;sculpta''. Further, slicing the fruit body of ''A.&nbsp;magniverrucata'' in half will reveal internal structures of [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] not present in puffballs.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Calvatia sculpta"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
The sculptured puffball grows solitarily or in small groups in [[forest floor|forest duff]]. It is typically associated with [[conifer]]ous forests at high elevations, greater than about {{convert|750|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}},<ref name=Lukas2004/> on western mountains like the Sierra Nevada and the [[Cascade Range]].<ref name=McKnight1987/><ref name=Arora1991/> The United States distribution includes the states of [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Idaho]].<ref name=Zeller1964/> An uncommon species,<ref name=Arora1986/> it fruits throughout spring, summer, and fall during wet weather.<ref name=Miller2006/>

Most commonly known from western North America,<ref name=Miller2006/> the species was reported growing on sandy soil in [[Natal Dunes State Park]] in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern Brazilian]] state of [[Rio Grande do Norte]] in 2008. The fruit bodies were associated with the roots of the native tree species ''[[Eugenia brasiliensis]]''. Several hypotheses have been proposed to account for this [[disjunct distribution]]: the species may have been present before the Americas separated; it may have been [[introduced species|introduced]] to Brazil by human activity, and subsequently adapted to the environment there; or the North and South American populations may represent a [[cryptic species complex]]—appearing [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar but genetically distinct. The Brazilian population has not been compared genetically with North American specimens.<ref name=Baseia2008/>
