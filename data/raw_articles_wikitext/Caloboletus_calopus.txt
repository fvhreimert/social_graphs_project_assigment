'''''Caloboletus calopus''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''bitter bolete''',<ref name="Arora 1986"/> '''bitter beech bolete''' or '''scarlet-stemmed bolete''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the [[Boletaceae|bolete family]]. [[Christiaan Persoon]] first [[species description|described]] ''Boletus calopus'' in 1801. Modern [[molecular phylogenetics]] showed that it was only distantly related to the [[type species]] of ''[[Boletus]]'' and required placement in a new genus; ''[[Caloboletus]]'' was erected in 2014, with ''C.&nbsp;calopus'' designated as the type species.

The stout [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are attractively coloured, with a beige to olive [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to 15&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;in) across, yellow pores, and a reddish [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] up to {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} wide. The pale yellow [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] stains blue when broken or bruised. Its red stipe distinguishes it from ''[[Boletus edulis]]''.

Appearing in [[conifer]]ous and [[deciduous forest|deciduous woodland]] in summer and autumn, the species is found in Eurasia and North America. Although not typically considered [[edible mushroom|edible]] due to an intensely bitter taste that does not disappear with cooking, there are reports of it being consumed in eastern Europe.

==Taxonomy==
''Caloboletus calopus'' was originally published under the name ''Boletus olivaceus'' by [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] in 1774,<ref name="Schäffer 1774"/> but this name is unavailable for use as it was later [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] for another species.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Boletus olivaceus"/> [[Johann Friedrich Gmelin]]'s 1792 [[Synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]] ''Boletus lapidum''<ref name="Gmelin 1792"/> is also illegitimate.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Boletus lapidum"/> [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] [[Species description|described]] the mushroom in 1801;<ref name="Persoon 1801"/> its [[botanical name|specific name]] is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''καλος/kalos'' ("pretty") and ''πους/pous'' ("foot"), referring to its brightly coloured [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. The German name, ''Schönfußröhrling'' or "pretty-foot bolete", is a literal translation. Alternate [[common name]]s are scarlet-stemmed bolete<ref name="Lamaison 2005"/> and bitter beech bolete.<ref name="urlRecommended English Names for Fungi"/>

Other synonyms include binomials resulting from generic transfers to ''Dictyopus'' by [[Lucien Quélet]] in 1886,<ref name="Quélet 1886"/> and ''Tubiporus'' by [[René Maire]] in 1937.<ref name="Maire 1937"/> ''Boletus frustosus'', originally published as a distinct species by [[Wally Snell]] and Esther Dick in 1941,<ref name="Snell 1941"/> was later described as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''B.&nbsp;calopus'' by [[Orson K. Miller]] and [[Roy Watling]] in 1968.<ref name="Miller 1968"/> Estadès and Lannoy described the variety ''ruforubraporus'' and the [[form (botany)|form]] ''ereticulatus'' from Europe in 2001.<ref name="Estadès 2001"/>

In his 1986 infrageneric [[classification (biology)|classification]] of the genus ''Boletus'', [[Rolf Singer]] placed ''C.&nbsp;calopus'' as the [[type species]] of the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Calopodes'', which includes species characterised by having a whitish to yellowish flesh, bitter taste, and a blue staining reaction in the tube walls. Other species in section ''Calopodes'' include ''[[Caloboletus radicans|C.&nbsp;radicans]]'', ''[[Caloboletus inedulis|C.&nbsp;inedulis]]'', ''[[Boletus peckii|B.&nbsp;peckii]]'', and ''[[Boletus pallidus|B.&nbsp;pallidus]]''.<ref name="Singer 1986"/> [[Molecular phylogenetics|Genetic analysis]] published in 2013 showed that ''C.&nbsp;calopus'' and many (but not all) red-pored boletes were part of a ''dupainii'' [[clade]] (named for [[Rubroboletus dupainii|''Boletus'' (now ''Rubroboletus'')&nbsp;''dupainii'']]), well-removed from the core group of the type species ''[[Boletus edulis|B.&nbsp;edulis]]'' and relatives within the [[Boletineae]]. This indicated it needed placement in a new genus.<ref name="Nuhn 2013"/> This took place in 2014, ''B.&nbsp;calopus'' was transferred to (and designated the [[type species]] of) the new genus ''[[Caloboletus]]'' by Italian mycologist Alfredo Vizzini.<ref name="Vizzini 2014"/>

==Description==


Up to {{convert|15|cm|frac=4}} or rarely 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) in diameter, the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is beige to olive and initially almost globular before opening out to a hemispherical and then convex shape.<ref name="Zeitlmayr l976"/> The surface of the cap is smooth or has minute hairs, and sometimes develops cracks with age.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> The [[cap cuticle]] hangs over the cap margin.<ref name="Laessoe 2002"/> The pore surface is initially pale yellow before deepening to an olive-yellow in maturity, and quickly turns blue when it is injured. The pores, numbering one or two per millimetre, are circular when young but become more angular as the mushroom ages. The tubes are up to {{convert|2|cm|1|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name="Bessette 2000"/>

The attractively coloured stipe is typically yellow above to pink-red below, with a straw-coloured network (reticulation) near the top or over the upper half;<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> occasionally the entire stipe is reddish.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> It measures {{convert|7–15|cm|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2–5|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick, and is either fairly equal in width throughout, or thicker towards the base.<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> Sometimes, the reddish stipe colour of mature mushrooms or harvested specimens that are a few days old disappears completely, and is replaced with ochre-brown tones.<ref name="Alessio 1985"/> The pale yellow [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] stains blue when broken, the discolouration spreading out from the damaged area.<ref name="Haas 1969"/> Its smell can be strong, and has been likened to ink.<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> The [[spore print]] is olive to olive-brown. The [[basidiospore|spore]]s are smooth and elliptical, measuring 13–19 by 5–6&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30–38 by 9–12&nbsp;μm. The [[cystidia]] are club-shaped to spindle-shaped, [[hyaline]], and measure 25–40 by 10–15&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Alessio 1985"/>

Variety ''frustosus'' is [[morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar to the main type, but its cap becomes areolate (marked out into small areas by cracks and crevices) in maturity. Its spores are slightly smaller too, measuring 11–15 by 4–5.5&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> In the European form ''ereticulatus'', the reticulations on the upper stipe are replaced with fine reddish granules, while the variety ''ruforubraporus'' has pinkish-red pores.<ref name="Estadès 2001"/>

The overall colouration of ''Caloboletus calopus'', with its pale cap, yellow pores and red stipe, is not shared with any other bolete.<ref name="Breitenbach 1991"/> Large pale specimens resemble ''[[Suillellus luridus]]'', and the cap of ''[[Rubroboletus satanas]]'' is a similar colour but this species has red pores. Fruit bodies in poor condition could be confused with ''[[Xerocomellus chrysenteron]]'' but the stipes of this species are not reticulated.<ref name="Haas 1969"/> Edible species such as ''[[Boletus edulis|B.&nbsp;edulis]]'' lack a red stipe.<ref name="Zeitlmayr l976"/> It closely resembles the similarly inedible ''C.&nbsp;radicans'', which lacks the redness on the stipe.<ref name="Breitenbach 1991"/> Like ''C.&nbsp;calopus'', the western North American species ''[[Caloboletus rubripes|C.&nbsp;rubripes]]'' also has a bitter taste, similarly coloured cap, and yellowish pores that bruise blue, but it lacks reticulation on its reddish stipe.<ref name="Davis 2012"/> Found in northwestern North America, ''[[Boletus coniferarum|B.&nbsp;coniferarum]]'' lacks reddish or pinkish colouration in its yellow reticulate stipe, and has a darker, olive-grey to deep brown cap.<ref name="Arora 1986"/>

Two eastern North American species, ''C.&nbsp;inedulis'' and ''[[Caloboletus roseipes|C.&nbsp;roseipes]]'', also have an appearance similar to ''C.&nbsp;calopus''. ''C.&nbsp;inedulis'' produces smaller fruit bodies with a white to greyish-white cap, while ''C.&nbsp;roseipes'' associates solely with [[Tsuga|hemlock]].<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> ''[[Caloboletus firmus|C.&nbsp;firmus]]'', found in the eastern United States, eastern Canada, and Costa Rica, has a pallid cap colour, reddish stipe, and bitter taste, but unlike ''C.&nbsp;calopus'', has red pores and lacks stipe reticulation.<ref name="Halling 1999"/> ''[[Caloboletus panniformis|C.&nbsp;panniformis]]'', a Japanese species described as new to science in 2013, bears a resemblance to ''C.&nbsp;calopus'', but can be distinguished by its rough cap surface, or microscopically by the [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]-[[staining]] cells in the flesh of the cap, and morphologically distinct [[cystidia]] on the stipe.<ref name="Takahashi 2013"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
An [[ectomycorrhiza]]l species,<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> ''Caloboletus calopus'' grows in [[conifer]]ous and [[deciduous]] woodland, often at higher altitudes, especially under [[beech]] and [[oak]].<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> Fruit bodies occur singly or in large groups.<ref name="Alessio 1985"/> The species grows on chalky ground from July to December, in Northern Europe,<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> and North America's [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[Michigan]].<ref name="Phillips 2005"/> In North America, its range extends south to Mexico.<ref name="Landeros 2006"/> Variety ''frustosus'' is known from [[California]] and the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[Idaho]].<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> In 1968, after comparing European and North American collections, Miller and Watling suggested that the typical form of ''C.&nbsp;calopus'' does not occur in the United States. Similar comparisons by other authors have led them to the opposite conclusion,<ref name="urlCA Boletes -- Boletus calopus"/> and the species has since been included in several North American [[field guide]]s.<ref name="Arora 1986"/><ref name="Bessette 2000"/><ref name="Davis 2012"/> The bolete has been recorded from the [[Black Sea]] region in [[Turkey]],<ref name="Sesli 2007"/> from under ''[[Populus ciliata]]'' and ''[[Abies pindrow]]'' in [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Nathia Gali]] in Pakistan,<ref name="Sarwar 2007"/> [[Yunnan]] Province in China,<ref name="Wang Lan 2006"/> Korea,<ref name="Kim 2004"/> and Taiwan.<ref name="Yeh 1981"/>

==Edibility==
Although an attractive-looking bolete, the species is not considered edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking.<ref name="Carluccio 2003"/> There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine.<ref name="Boa 2004"/>

== Biochemistry ==


The bitter taste is largely due to the compounds calopin<ref name="Hellwig 2002" /> and a δ-[[lactone]] derivative, ''O''-acetylcyclocalopin&nbsp;A. These compounds contains a [[structural motif]] known as a [[3-Methylcatechol|3-methylcatechol]] unit, which is rare in [[natural product]]s. A [[total synthesis]] of calopin was reported in 2003.<ref name="Ebel 2003" /> The ''frustosus'' variety is reported as causing severe sickness in Europe.<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuides]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=396|author-link1=Orson K. Miller Jr.}}</ref>

The [[pulvinic acid]] derivatives [[atromentic acid]], [[variegatic acid]], and [[xerocomic acid]] are present in ''B.&nbsp;calopus'' mushrooms. These compounds [[enzyme inhibition|inhibit]] [[cytochrome P450]]—major [[enzyme]]s involved in [[drug metabolism]] and [[bioactivation]].<ref name="Huang 2009"/>  Other compounds found in the fruit bodies include calopin&nbsp;B,<ref name="Kim 2006"/> and the [[sesquiterpenoid]] compounds cyclopinol<ref name="Liu 2008"/> and boletunones&nbsp;A and B. The latter two highly oxygenated compounds have significant [[antioxidant|free-radical scavenging]] activity ''[[in&nbsp;vitro]]''.<ref name="Kim 2004"/> The compounds {{nowrap|[[3-Octanone]]}} (47.0% of total [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]]  compounds), {{nowrap|[[3-Octanol]]}} (27.0%), [[1-Octen-3-ol|1-octen-3-ol]] (15.0%), and [[limonene]] (3.6%) are the predominant volatile components that give the fruit body its odour.<ref name="Rapior 1997"/>
