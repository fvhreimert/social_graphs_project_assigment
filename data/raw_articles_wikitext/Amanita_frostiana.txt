'''''Amanita frostiana''''', also known as '''Frost's amanita''',<ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> is a small yellow-to-red [[fungus]] found in eastern North America.

==Description==
Some of the species' notable physical characteristics, however, distinguish it from the other members of the genus. For instance, the colors of the cap, darkening over the disk and the universal veil colored yellow to cream. The other characteristics of the other parts of its body are as follows:

* '''Cap''' : The cap is convex or sometimes shield-shaped, becoming flat with a fairly distinctly lined margin.<ref name="Rogers">{{cite web |title=Amania frostiana |url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5537~gid~~source~gallerydefault.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231084311/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5537~gid~~source~gallerydefault.asp |archive-date=2010-12-31 |access-date=2011-03-15 |publisher=Rogers Mushrooms}}</ref> The cap may vary in lengths of {{Convert|2-8|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}}. The colors include yellow to golden orange or a different combination of scarlet or deep reddish pink. The surface is smooth, becoming slightly sticky when moist.<ref name=Metzler>{{cite book|last=S. Metzler|first=V. Metzler|title=Texas mushrooms: a field guide|year=1992|publisher=University of Texas Press|pages=331|isbn=9780292751255|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HRtfvVigMmsC&q=Amanita+frostiana&pg=PA331|format=PDF}}</ref>
* '''Stem/stipe''' : The stem, also called stipe. The universal veil material is yellow to cream, forming yellow powder or flakes at the base of the stalk. It measures {{Convert|47 to 62|mm|abbr=out|frac=2}} in length and 4 to 11&nbsp;mm in diameter, also consisting a persistent annulus.<ref name="Tulloss"/>
* '''Gills''' : The gills are free, close, and cream in mass. The short gills are truncate to excavated-truncate and are numerous.
* '''Spores and microscopic features''' : The spores measure 7.0 to 10.2&nbsp;μm wide and are globose to subglobose and inamyloid. It has also been noticed that the spores of this mushroom do not turn black in color if [[iodine]] is poured on it.<ref name=Shernoff>{{cite web|last=Shernoff L.|title=Amanita frostiana|url=http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/coma/ey/Amanit212.html|publisher=The Connecticut-Westchester Mycological Association (COMA)}}</ref>

=== Similar species ===
]]''A. frostiana'' is similar to a range of species, including others in the species ''[[Amanita]]'' like ''[[Amanita rubrovolvata|A.&nbsp;rubrovolvata]]'', ''[[Amanita flavoconia|A.&nbsp;flavoconia]]'', ''[[Amanita albocreata|A.&nbsp;albocreata]]'', ''[[Amanita muscaria var. muscaria|A.&nbsp;muscaria var. muscaria]]'' or simply ''[[Amanita muscaria|A.&nbsp;muscaria]]''.

''[[Amanita rubrovolvata|A. rubrovolvata]]'' is slightly similar physically to this species. The fungus produces small- to medium-sized mushrooms, with reddish-orange caps. [[Roger Heim]] reported ''A.&nbsp;frostiana'' as occurring in Thailand,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Heim R. |year=1962 |title=Contribution à la flore mycologique de la Thaïland |language=fr}}</ref> but this was probably a misidentification of ''A.&nbsp;rubrovolvata''.

''A. subfrostiana'', also referred to as 'False Frost's Amanita', has the same natural habitat as of ''A.&nbsp;frostiana'', but is mostly distributed in southwestern China.<ref name="Yang">{{cite web |last=R. E. Tulloss |title=Amanita subfrostiana |url=http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/subfrost.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723120747/http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/amanita/species/subfrost.html |archive-date=2011-07-23 |access-date=2011-03-16}}</ref> It resembles ''A.&nbsp;frostiana'' but differs in the paleness of color in the caps.

The distinct and starkly white bulb (e.g., 17 x 15&nbsp;mm) bears a white or yellow-white collar that is somewhat similar to the collar seen in the exannulate ''A.&nbsp;albocreata'',<ref name="Tulloss" /> which is a species of the hardwood-hemlock (''Tsuga'') forest of the northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada and of boreal forest at least as far north as the Island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

The clamps present at bases of basidia of this species specially support the presumed relationship to ''A.&nbsp;muscaria var. muscaria'' or simply ''A.&nbsp;muscaria''.<ref name="Tulloss" /> ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' is a poisonous and [[psychoactive]] [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]], one of many in the genus.

Many misidentifications have taken place while recognizing ''[[Amanita flavoconia|A.&nbsp;flavoconia]]'', one of the most common and widespread species of ''Amanita'' in eastern [[North America]], due to various similar physical characteristics. It is mostly confused due to their microscopic features.<ref name="Tulloss2">{{cite web |last=R. E. Tulloss |title=Amanita flavoconia G. F.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This rare species is considered native to eastern U.S. and southeastern Canada.<ref name="Tulloss" /> It is normally found in mixed forests with [[oak]]s (mostly [[Quercus]] oaks) and [[conifer]]s (mostly [[Pinaceae]] conifers).<ref name="Tulloss" /> 

==Edibility==
This species is of unknown edibility and may be poisonous.<ref name="Rogers"/><ref name=Bulletin>{{cite book|last=United States.
