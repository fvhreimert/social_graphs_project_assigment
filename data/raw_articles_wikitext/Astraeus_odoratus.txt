'''''Astraeus odoratus''''' ({{langx|th|เห็ดเผาะหนัง}}; ''Het pho nang'' เห็ดเผาะหนัง, ''Het pho'' เห็ดเผาะ, or ''Het nang'' เห็ดหนัง, the latter meaning "skin mushroom") is a species of [[Astraeus (fungus)|false earthstar]] in the family [[Diplocystaceae]]. Described as a new species in 2004, it was originally found in the [[Thai highlands]] growing in sandy or [[laterite]]-rich soil in dry lowland [[dipterocarp]] forests.<ref name=Phosri2004/> The species is found in [[Southeast Asia]].<ref name=Phosri2007/>

==Description==
[[Sporocarp (fungi)|Fruit bodies]] begin as brownish spheres or flattened spheres, partially submerged in the earth. The outer tissue layer, the [[exoperidium]], splits open in a star-like fashion into 3–9 rays. The rays are [[hygroscopic]], spreading out when moist and curling inward when dry. The fully expanded fruit body measures up to {{convert|65|mm|in}} in diameter. Fresh fruit bodies have an odor similar to moist soil.<ref name=Phosri2004/>

The spores are spherical, covered with spines, and measure 7.5–15.2&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The ornamentation of the spines on the surface is less dense than that of the similar ''[[Astraeus hygrometricus]]''.<ref name=Phosri2004/>

==Habitat and distribution==
 are set on fire by local farmers during the hot dry season from February to April in an attempt to increase the yield of the false earthstar.]]
''Astraeus odoratus'' it is found in the dry lowland [[dipterocarp]] forests of Thailand. The fungus fruits during the rainy season in May and June, in sandy or [[laterite]]-rich soil.<ref name=Phosri2004/> It is associated with [[Alder]], [[Chestnut]], ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' and [[Douglas-fir]].<ref name=Sysouphanthong2010/>

In Thailand, it is commonly believed that forest fires stimulate the growth of mushrooms, including ''A.&nbsp;odoratus'', and fires are set intentionally to increase the yield of fruit bodies. Although the mushrooms may be easier to find and collect on the [[forest floor|litter]]-free ground of burnt forest, there is no evidence that burning increases yield, while it does decrease the biodiversity and yield of other edible mushroom-producing fungi.<ref name=Sysouphanthong2010/>

==Uses==
Since they cannot be cultivated commercially, these mushrooms fetch a high price on the market.<ref name=Sysouphanthong2010/>

Young fruit bodies are collected from the wild and sold in the markets of [[Thailand]]. Thai people eat the blanched mushroom with ''[[nam phrik]]'' (Thai chilli pastes) or ''[[nam chim]]'' (dipping sauces), or cooked in curry and also only boiled in water with [[fish sauce]] and [[palm sugar]].<ref name=Petcharat2003/>
