'''''Auricularia heimuer''''', also known as '''heimuer''' ({{zh|s=黑木耳|p=hēimù'ěr}}) or '''black wood ear''', is a [[species]] of [[fungus]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Auriculariales]]. It is commercially cultivated for food in China at a value exceeding $4 billion (USD) per year. The species was previously referred to as the European ''[[Auricularia auricula-judae]]'', but the latter is not known to occur in East Asia. ''Auricularia heimuer'' is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes, such as [[hot and sour soup]], and it is also used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

==Description==

[[Sporocarp (fungi)|Fruitbodies]] are gelatinous, ear-shaped, and laterally attached to wood. They are up to {{convert|12|cm|abbr=off|frac=4}} across and {{convert|1.5|mm|abbr=on|frac=16}} thick. The upper surface is finely [[tomentose]], coloured fawn to reddish brown when fresh, and coloured grey-brown when dry. The colour of cultivated specimens is often darker. The spore-producing underside is smooth to slightly veined, coloured pinkish buff when fresh, and coloured purplish grey when dry.<ref name="wu2014"/>

===Microscopic features===
The [[basidia]] are cylindrical, 40–65 x 3–6.5&nbsp;μm, with three transverse [[Septum#Fungus|septa]]. The [[basidiospores]] are allantoid (sausage shaped), 11–13 x 4–5&nbsp;μm. Hairs on the upper surface are 50–150 x 4–6,5&nbsp;μm. When cross-sectioned, a medulla (a central band of parallel [[hyphae]]) is normally present.<ref name="wu2014"/>

===Similar species===
The Asian ''[[Auricularia villosula]]'' is very similar, but distinguishable microscopically by its shorter hairs (30–70&nbsp;μm long). Some strains of heimuer cultivated in China have proved to be ''A.&nbsp;villosula''.<ref name="wu2015"/> The European ''A.&nbsp;auricula-judae'' is superficially similar, but it is not as dark as cultivated ''A.&nbsp;heimuer'' and microscopically distinguishable by its larger basidia and spores, the latter measuring 14.5–18 x 5–6&nbsp;μm. Fruitbodies of both these species lack a medulla when cross-sectioned.<ref name="wu2021"/>

== Taxonomy ==

''A. heimuer'' was described in 2014 as a result of [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] research, based on [[cladistic]] analysis of [[DNA sequences]], into wild and cultivated species of ''[[Auricularia]]'' in China.<ref name="wu2014" /> This research revealed that the most frequently cultivated species was previously misdetermined as ''[[Auricularia auricula-judae]]'', a species confined to Europe, and was instead a separate and distinctive species restricted to east Asia. It was given the name ''Auricularia heimuer'' based on the Chinese vernacular name for the fungus: heimuer (黑木耳), which translates to black wood ear.<ref name="wu2014" />

== Distribution and habitat ==

''Auricularia heimuer'' is a [[Wood-decay fungus|wood-rotting species]], typically found on the dead standing or fallen wood of [[Broad-leaved tree|broadleaf trees]]. In the wild, it occurs most frequently on [[oak]] (''Quercus'') trees<ref name="wu2014"/> and less frequently on other broadleaf trees. In cultivation, it is sometimes grown on broadleaf logs, and is more commonly grown on [[Growth medium|growing media]] containing sawdust.

The species occurs in temperate areas of northern China,<ref name="wu2014"/> as well as the Russian Far East,<ref name="wu2014"/> Korea,<ref name=Cho2021/> and Japan.<ref name=Kusamoto/>

==Uses==

In China, the use of an ''Auricularia'' species, probably ''A. heimuer'', as a food and a medicine was recorded in the 3rd-century Chinese medicinal book ''[[Shennong Ben Cao Jing]]''.<ref name="wu2015"/> Species were being cultivated in China as early as the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907). [[Li Shizhen]], in his ''[[Bencao Gangmu|Pen Tsao Kang Mu]]'', quotes Tang Ying-chuan from that period as saying "put the steamed bran on logs, cover with straw, Wood Ear will grow".<ref name="Chang"/> The fungus is widely used as an ingredient in savoury dishes and is also cooked and served as a salad with vegetables and flavourings. A soup containing the species is used medicinally for dealing with colds and fevers in the belief that it reduces the heat of the body.<ref name="Acton"/><ref name="Harding"/> According to a 2010 publication, the annual production of ''Auricularia'' species worldwide is the fourth highest among all industrially cultivated culinary and [[medicinal mushrooms]].<ref name="Tang2010"/> The estimated annual output in China in 2013 was 4.75 billion kg in fresh weight, with a value of about four billion US dollars.<ref name="wu2015"/>

In Japan, the fungus is known as ''kikurage'' (キクラゲ; {{literal translation}} "wood jellyfish") and is commonly shredded and used as a topping in [[ramen]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2025}} A 2018 Japanese study surveyed 26 local specimens originally determined as ''A.&nbsp;auricula-judae''. The molecular identification was as follows: 4 samples of ''A.&nbsp;heimuer'', 7 of ''[[Auricularia minutissima|A. minutissima]]'', 10 of ''[[Auricularia villosula|A. villosula]]'', and 5 of ''[[Auricularia thailandica|A. thailandica]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=貴 |first1=白水 |last2=重樹 |first2=稲葉 |last3=秀爾 |first3=牛島 |last4=康仁 |first4=奥田 |last5=栄史 |first5=長澤 |title=日本産 "Auricularia auricula-judae " および" A. polytricha " の分子系統解析と形態比較に基づく分類学的検討 |journal=日本菌学会会報 |date=2018 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=jjom.H30–02 |doi=10.18962/jjom.jjom.H30-02 |url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjom/59/1/59_jjom.H30-02/_article/-char/ja/ |doi-access=free}}</ref>

In Korea, the mushroom is called ''heuk-mogi'' ({{korean|hangul=흑목이|hanja=黑木耳}}).

==In popular culture==
The Pokémon [[Toedscool]] and Toedscruel are partially based on these mushrooms.
