'''''Russula aeruginea''''', also known as the '''grass-green russula''', the '''tacky green russula''', or the '''green russula''', is an edible ''[[Russula]]'' mushroom. Widely distributed in northern [[temperate]] regions, it is usually found under [[birch]], mostly in pine forests.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] in [[Elias Magnus Fries]]'s 1863 work ''Monographia Hymenomycetum Sueciae''.<ref name="urlMycoBank"/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''aeruginea'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''aeruginus'', referring to the tarnished color of [[copper]].<ref name="Evenson 1997"/> It is commonly known variously as the "tacky green Russula",<ref name="Laessoe 2002"/> the "grass-green Russula",<ref name="Garnweidner 1994"/> or the "green Russula".<ref name="Arora 1986"/>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is flat when young, soon funnel shaped and weakly striped; somewhat sticky and shiny, pale green to light grey-green, more rarely olive green. It is often {{convert|4 to 10|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter. The closely spaced [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are pale cream when young, later becoming light yellow when the spores mature. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white, occasionally with rust-coloured spots at the base, often rather short with longitudinal furrows. It measures {{convert|5–8|cm|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1–2|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name="Courtecuisse 1999"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, brittle and without scent, with a mild taste.<ref name="Garnweidner 1994"/>

The [[spore print]] is cream-yellow. The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are spherical to oval with ridges and warts on the surface, and measure 6–8 by 6–7&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Evenson 1997"/>

The very poisonous [[death cap]] can have a similar appearance, especially from above.{{citation needed|date=May 2025}}

Green specimens of [[Russula xerampelina|''R.&nbsp;xerampelina'']] (the crab brittlegill) are similar,<ref name="Nilper 1977"/> but always smell of cooked shellfish.<ref name="Garnweidner 1994"/> ''[[Russula grisea|R.&nbsp;grisea]]'' and ''[[Russula parazurea|R.&nbsp;parazurea]]'' are also similar.<ref name="Arora 1986" />

==Habitat and distribution==
The fruit bodies grow on the ground in woods, in troops in leaf litter or in grass. It is [[ectomycorrhiza]]l with [[birch]], but also with found under conifers, particularly [[pine]] and [[spruce]].<ref name="Laessoe 2002" /> It is widely distributed in northern [[temperate]] zones. Fruiting occurs from July to November in Europe,<ref name="Courtecuisse 1999" /> and in later summer to autumn in North America.<ref name="Evenson 1997" /> The fungus is also found in East Africa.<ref name="Dugan 2011" />

==Uses==
The mushrooms are [[edible mushroom|edible]].<ref name="Arora 1986"/>
