'''''Russula aurea''''', commonly known as the '''gilded brittlegill''', is an uncommon species of [[mushroom]] found in [[deciduous forest|deciduous woodland]] in Europe in summer and early autumn. Unlike many red-capped members of the genus, it is [[edible mushroom|edible]] and mild-tasting.

== Taxonomy ==

It was known for many years as ''Russula aurata'' originally published in 1801 as ''Agaricus auratus'' by the English naturalist [[William Withering]], and placed by the father of mycology [[Elias Magnus Fries]] into the genus ''[[Russula]]'' in 1838. However, the binomial name ''Russula aurea'' had been coined by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1796<ref>Persoon, ''Observationes mycologicae, Seu descriptiones tam novorum, quam notabilium fungorum'' (1796) vol. I:101 .</ref> and takes precedence. Both [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]]s are derived from the [[Latin]] ''aurum'' "gold", hence "golden".<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| date = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref>

== Description ==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|4|–|9|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide and a blood- or orange-red in colour with ridged margins. Sticky when wet, it is initially convex, then later flat, or depressed; it is able to be peeled half-way. The widely spaced [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are ochre with yellow edges, and adnexed or free. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is up to {{convert|3|–|8|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|–|2.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, cylindrical and white or cream to golden-yellow. The brittle [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is yellow and the taste mild. The [[spore print]] is ochre, the warty spores are oval or round and measure 7.5–9&nbsp;×&nbsp;6–8&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book| author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page=19}}</ref>

The overall yellow tone of ''Russula aurea'' distinguishes it from the peppery and inedible red-capped Russulas, such as the bloody brittlegill (''[[Russula sanguinaria|R.&nbsp;sanguinaria]]''), the sickener (''[[Russula emetica|R.&nbsp;emetica]]''), and the beechwood sickener (''[[Russula nobilis|R.&nbsp;nobilis]]'').<ref name=nilper>{{cite book |vauthors=Nilson S, Persson O| year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page=118}}</ref>

== Distribution and habitat ==

''Russula aurea'' is found in Europe and is uncommon in Britain. It has been recorded as far east as the Black Sea region of eastern Turkey.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Yagiz D, Afyon A, Konuk M, Helfer S |year=2006 |title=Contributions to the Macrofungi of Bolu and Düzce Provinces, Turkey |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=95 |pages=331–34 |url=http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/mycotaxon/56.pdf |access-date=2008-08-10 |archive-date=2011-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521150915/http://rbg-web2.rbge.org.uk/mycotaxon/56.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Sesli E|year=2007|title=Checklist of the Turkish ascomycota and basidiomycota collected from the Black Sea region |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=99 |pages=71–74 |url=http://mycotaxon.com/resources/checklists/sesliv99-checklist.pdf|access-date=2008-08-10}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>
