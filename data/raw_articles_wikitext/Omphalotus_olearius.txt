'''''Omphalotus olearius''''',<ref name=":2" /> commonly known as the '''jack-o'-lantern mushroom''', is a poisonous [[Orange (color)|orange]] gilled [[mushroom]] that to an untrained eye appears similar to some [[Cantharellus|chanterelle]]s. It is notable for its [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] properties. It is found in woodland areas in Europe, where it grows on decaying stumps, on buried roots or at the base of hardwood trees. A similar, but [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] distinct<ref name="Kirchmair2004" /> species found in eastern North America is ''[[Omphalotus illudens]]''.

Unlike chanterelles, ''Omphalotus olearius'' and other ''Omphalotus'' species contain the toxin [[Illudin|illudin S]], and are [[poison]]ous to humans. While not typically lethal, consuming this mushroom leads to very severe [[cramp]]s, [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Vanden Hoek |first1=T.

== Description ==
''Omphalotus olearius'' is the same shade of orange internally and externally. It does not change color when bruised or sliced, a feature which helps to distinguish it from visibly similar species.<ref name=":03">{{Cite web |last=Kuo |first=Michael |date=8 September 2023 |title=Omphalotus olearius (MushroomExpert.Com) |url=https://www.mushroomexpert.com/omphalotus_olearius.html |access-date=2024-11-06 |website=www.mushroomexpert.com}}</ref> Its bioluminescence, a blue-green color, can be observed in fresh specimens in low light conditions once the [[Human eye|eye]] becomes [[Adaptation (eye)|dark-adapted]]. The whole mushroom does not glow—only the gills do so. This is due to an [[enzyme]] called [[luciferase]], acting upon a compound called [[luciferin]], leading to the emission of light much as [[firefly|fireflies]] do when glowing.<ref name="Oliveira2012" /> Bioluminescence has been shown to aid in the reproduction of fungi by attracting insects to them to spread spores.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Michelson |first=Molly |date=26 March 2015 |title=Why Mushrooms Glow - California Academy of Sciences |url=https://www.calacademy.org/explore-science/why-mushrooms-glow#:~:text=%E2%80%9CRegulation%20implies%20an%20adaptive%20function,can%20all%20be%20proud%20of! |access-date=2024-11-15 |website=www.calacademy.org |language=en}}</ref> However, the jack-o'-lantern mushroom does not use bioluminescence for the purpose of attracting insects, and studies on it have not yet determined the exact purpose of bioluminescence in this species.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Jack-O'-Lantern Mushroom |url=https://yardandgarden.extension.iastate.edu/article/2005/11-9/jack.html |access-date=2024-11-06 |website=Yard and Garden |language=en}}</ref>

Identifiable characteristics of the jack-o'-lantern mushroom include true, sharp, [[decurrent]], non-forking gills.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web |title=Jack-o'-Lantern |url=https://mdc.mo.gov/discover-nature/field-guide/jack-o-lantern |access-date=2024-11-06 |website=Missouri Department of Conservation |language=en}}</ref> The smell of these mushrooms is non-distinctive. [[Pileus (mycology)|Cap]] size can range from 4–12&nbsp;cm in diameter. The jack-o'-lantern [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] can vary between {{convert|1|-|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} in thickness and {{convert|3.5|-|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length from attachment to cap to base of stem.<ref name=":03"/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
''Omphalotus olearius'' are an uncommon find and can be seen in the summer and fall seasons (July–October) in regions of southern Europe. This range includes southern France, the [[Iberian Peninsula]], and other Mediterranean countries.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web |title=Omphalotus olearius, Mushroom identification |url=https://www.first-nature.com/fungi/omphalotus-olearius.php |access-date=2024-11-12 |website=www.first-nature.com}}</ref> This species has also been reported from the [[Western Cape|Western Cape Province]], [[South Africa]].<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Omphalotus olearius (DC.)

The roots, decaying stumps, and bases of hardwoods are their preferred habitat, particularly on the decaying roots of olive trees.<ref name=":22" /><ref name=":03"/>{{mycomorphbox

== Similar species ==
Several species of chanterelles may be confused with the jack-o'-lantern mushroom. A characteristic that distinguishes chanterelles from the jack-o'-lantern is the appearance of the gills. Jack-o'-lanterns have sharp, bendable, paper-like gills; chanterelles, however, have false gills that take the appearance of blunt ridges.<ref name=":12"/> Furthermore, if the jack-o'-lantern's stem is peeled, the same shade of orange as the outer flesh, while the chanterelle is paler inside the stem. The Jack-o'-lantern mushroom is also mistaken as the edible [[Laetiporus]] as they have a similar color scheme.

Two common bioluminescent species that can be found in North America are ''[[Omphalotus illudens]]'' and ''[[Omphalotus olivascens]].'' ''Omphalotus olivascens'' is common to southern to central [[California]], while ''Omphalotus illudens'' is found in eastern [[North America]]. Both of these species are poisonous. The similarly poisonous mushroom Tsukiyotake (''[[Omphalotus japonicus]]'', formerly known as ''Lampteromyces japonicus),'' can be found in [[Japan]] and eastern [[Asia]] and is also bioluminescent and contains the same poison, [[illudin]].<ref name=Kirchmair2004/>
