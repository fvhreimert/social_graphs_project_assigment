'''''Inocybe praetervisa''''' is a small, yellow and brown mushroom in the family [[Inocybaceae]], distinguished from other members of the genus by its unusual [[spore]]s and bulb. The unusual spores led to the species being named the [[type species]] of the now-abandoned genus ''Astrosporina''; recent studies have shown that such a genus could not exist, as the species with the defining traits do not form a [[monophyletic]] group. However, it is a part of several [[clade]]s within the genus ''[[Inocybe]]''. ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' grows on the ground in woodland, favouring [[beech]] trees, and is found in Europe, North America and Asia. It is inedible and probably [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] due to the presence of [[muscarine]]. The ingestion of muscarine can lead to [[SLUDGE syndrome]], and could potentially lead to death due to [[respiratory failure]].

==Taxonomy and naming==
''Inocybe praetervisa'' was [[species description|first described]] by [[Lucien Quélet]] in the first volume of [[Giacomo Bresadola]]'s  1883 publication ''Fungi tridentini''.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fungi tridentini |journal=Fungi Tridentini |author=Bresadola, Giacomo. |year=1883 |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=27–42 |language=Latin}}</ref> The species was moved to the genus ''Astrosporina'' by [[Joseph Schröter]] in 1889,<ref>{{cite book |title=Kryptogamen-Flora von Schlesien |volume=3–1(1) |year=1885 |author=Schröter, Joseph. |page=576 |language=German}}</ref> but this was rejected, and the name ''Astrosporina praetervisa'' is now considered an obligate [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]].<ref>"[http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=240227 ''Inocybe praetervisa'']".

Accessed 23 October 2010.</ref> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''praetervisa'' comes from the [[Latin]] word meaning "overlooked".<ref>{{cite book |title= British Basidiomycetae: a handbook to the larger British Fungi|last= Rea|first= Carleton|year= 1968|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]|page= 209}}</ref>

Within the genus ''Inocybe'', ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' has been placed in the [[subgenus]] ''Inocybe''. Mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] places the species in the [[Section (botany)|section]] ''Marginatae''; mycologist Thom Kuyper considers ''Marginatae'' a [[supersection]], and includes ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' along with ''[[Inocybe abietis|I.&nbsp;abietis]]'', ''[[Inocybe calospora|I.&nbsp;calospora]]'' and ''[[Inocybe godeyi|I.&nbsp;godeyi]]''. [[Phylogenetics]] has shown that, in addition to the large [[clade]] of subgenus ''Inocybe'', ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' forms a clade with ''I.&nbsp;calospora'', ''[[Inocybe lanuginosa|I.&nbsp;lanuginosa]]'' and ''[[Inocybe leptophylla|I.&nbsp;leptophylla]]''. The species are similar in that all four have [[basidiospore]]s with small [[wikt:nodule|nodules]]; it was this feature that defined the genus ''Astrosporina'', with then ''A.&nbsp;praetervisa'' as its type species. However, when phylogenetic analysis later concluded that nodulose-spored ''Inocybe'' species do not form a [[monophyletic]] group, the name ''Astrosporina'' was deemed inappropriate at a generic level. But it may be considered useful at a lower level to refer to the [[clade]] of the four ''Inocybe'' species. Of those four, ''I.&nbsp;praetervisa'' is most closely related to ''I.&nbsp;calospora'', with which it forms a smaller and closer clade.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Matheny, P.

==Description==
''Inocybe praetervisa'' has a bell-shaped (later expanding) [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in}} in diameter, which is a yellowish-brown colour. It is [[fibre|fibrous]], and splits from the margin (which curves inwards<ref name="Sterry"/>) to the centre. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is from {{convert|5|to|6|cm|in}} in height, and from {{convert|3|to|8|mm|in}} thick. It is white, maturing to a pale straw-yellow, and the whole stem is [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]], meaning it is covered in particles resembling [[Flour|meal]].<ref name="Phillips">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe|author= Phillips, Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page=153}}</ref> The stem has a distinct bulb at the base, which is moderately [[wikt:marginate|marginate]],<ref name="Sterry"/><ref name="Phillips"/> and lacks a [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]].<ref name="Jordan"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, and discolours to yellowish in the stem. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially whitish, but later become a [[clay]]-brown with toothed, white edges.<ref name="Sterry"/><ref name="Phillips"/> They are adnexed, meaning they connect to the stem by only part of their depth, and are crowded closely together.<ref name="Sterry"/>

===Microscopic features===
''Inocybe praetervisa'' leaves a clay-brown [[spore print]], while the [[spore]]s themselves are rectangular with a large number of "distinct, angular knobs".<ref name="Phillips"/> In size, the spores measure between {{convert|10|and|12|um}} in length by between {{convert|7|and|9|um}} in width. ''Inocybe praetervisa'' has both [[Cystidium|pleuro- and cheilocystidia]] which are relatively [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]-shaped with apical encrustation. The cystidia have [[hyaline]] or pale yellow [[cell wall|walls]].<ref name="Phillips"/>

===Similar species===
The species can be differentiated from the similar ''[[Inocybe cookei|I.&nbsp;cookei]]'' by its "irregular, lumpy spores".<ref name="Kibby">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and Northern Europe|last= Kibby|first= Geoffrey|year= 2003|publisher= [[Hamlyn (publishers)|Hamlyn]]|isbn= 978-0-7537-1865-0|page= 99}}</ref> It is also similar to ''[[Inocybe rimosa|I.&nbsp;rimosa]]'', but differs in the presence of a bulb.<ref name="Sterry">{{cite book |title= Complete Guide to British Mushrooms & Toadstools|author1=Sterry, Paul |author2=Hughes, Barry |year= 2009|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|isbn= 978-0-00-723224-6|page= 196}}</ref> Another species that can be differentiated by the lack of a bulb is ''[[Inocybe numerosigibba|I.&nbsp;numerosigibba]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= The taxonomic studies of the genus ''Inocybe''|last= Kobayashi|first= Takahito|year= 2002|publisher= J.

Consumption of muscarine could lead to a number of physiological effects, including: excess [[salivation]], [[lacrimation]], uncontrollable [[urination]] and [[defecation]], [[gastrointestinal problem]]s and [[emesis]] (vomiting); this array of symptoms is also known by the acronym [[SLUDGE syndrome|SLUDGE]].<ref name="Hall">{{cite book |title= Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms of the World|last= Hall|first= Ian Robert|author2= Buchanan, Peter K.|author3= Stephenson, Steven L.|author4= Yun, Wang|author5= Cole, Anthony L.
