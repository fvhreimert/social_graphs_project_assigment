''Tricholoma orirubens'' can also form [[fairy ring]]s. One found in Germany had a diameter of around {{convert|80|m|ft|abbr=on}} and contained an estimated 10,000 mushrooms.<ref name=Haas69>{{cite book| last = Haas |first=Hans | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi |page=142| publisher = Burke | isbn= 0-222-79409-7}}</ref>
