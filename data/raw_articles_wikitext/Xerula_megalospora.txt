'''''Xerula megalospora''''' is a [[species]] of [[Agaricales|gilled mushroom]] in the family [[Physalacriaceae]].

''Xerula megalospora'' [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] occur on the ground, solitarily or in small groups. They are [[saprobic]] and found near the well-decayed stumps of [[oak]] or other [[broadleaf tree]]s. This species can grow up to {{convert|13|cm|in|abbr=on}} high.  The [[pileus (mycology)|caps]], {{convert|2|–|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} across, can be a convex or [[umbonate]] shape eventually becoming flat and centrally depressed.  The cap is viscid and colored smokey white to pale [[buff (color)|buff]]. [[Lamella (mycology)|Gills]] are adnate, white, and smooth. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of ''Xerula megalospora'' is white, and the odor is sometimes described as being reminiscent of carrots.  The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] contains a root-like extension {{convert|8|–|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. The [[spore print]] is white. The [[spore]]s of this species are a distinguishing feature being a relatively large 18–23 by 11–14&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The [[botanical name]] ''megalospora'' means large-spored. The spore shape is citriniform (i.e., lemon shaped), the surface is finely roughened, and spores are non-[[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]. This species is widespread and fairly common in urban areas.

The species is edible although consists of little flesh.<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last=Miller Jr.|first=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=174|author-link=Orson K.
