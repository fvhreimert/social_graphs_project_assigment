Appearing in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] from mid to late autumn, it is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but may cause gastrointestinal issues.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described and named as ''Agaricus nebularis'' in 1789 by [[August Johann Georg Karl Batsch]]. It was later placed in the genus ''[[Clitocybe]]'' in 1871 by [[Paul Kummer]] as ''Clitocybe nebularis''. After much consideration by many mycologists, over some years, when it was placed for periods in both ''[[Lepista]]'', and ''[[Gymnopus]]'', it was placed back in ''Clitocybe'' with the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]], and 1871 accreditation it retains today.

''Clitocybe nebularis'' var. ''alba'' Bataille (1911), differs only in having a milk white cap, and is very rare.<ref name="Phillips">{{Cite web|title=Rogers Mushrooms|url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5799~source~gallerychooserresult.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000746/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~5799~source~gallerychooserresult.asp|archive-date=2016-03-04|access-date=2011-11-17}}</ref>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the mushroom is {{convert|5–25|cm|frac=2}} in diameter, [[wikt:convex|convex]] with an incurved margin, becoming plane to depressed in shape. Cap colours are generally greyish to light brownish-grey, and often covered in a whitish bloom when young. The surface of the cap is usually dry to moist, and radially fibrillose. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are pale, adnate to short-decurrent, close and usually forked.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=93}}</ref> The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures {{convert|5-10|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} long and 2–4&nbsp;cm wide;<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

It is usually somewhat lighter than the cap.<ref name=Phillips/> The flesh is white, and very thick. It usually has a foul-smelling [[odour]], which has been described as slightly farinaceous to spicy, or rancid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Clitocybe_nebularis.html |title=California Fungi: Clitocybe nebularis |accessdate=2008-01-11 }}</ref><ref name=":1" />

=== Similar species ===
The species can resemble ''[[Clitocybe robusta|C.&nbsp;robusta]]'' which has a more solid white cap, ''[[Clitocybe irina|C.&nbsp;irina]]'' which has a pinkish spore print, ''[[Ampulloclitocybe clavipes]]'', and ''[[Harmajaea harperi]]''.<ref name="audu" />

It may also be confused with the poisonous ''[[Entoloma sinuatum]]'' both in Europe or North America, though this species has pink sinuate gills.<ref name="Haas69">{{cite book|author=Haas H|title=The Young Specialist looks at Fungi|publisher=Burke|year=1969|isbn=0-222-79409-7|pages=128}}</ref> It also resembles ''[[Leucopaxillus albissimus]]'' and ''[[Tricholoma saponaceum]]''.<ref name=":0" /> ''[[Leucopaxillus giganteus]]'' is also similar in stature, but is whiter.<ref name=":1" /> ''[[Infundibulicybe geotropa]]'' has a pale brown cap.<ref name=":1" />

== Ecology ==
This species is host to the parasitic gilled mushroom ''[[Volvariella surrecta]]'', which is found on older specimens.

==Edibility==
The species is edible but even a small portion can cause [[gastrointestinal disturbances]] for some people.<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=187|author-link=Orson K.
