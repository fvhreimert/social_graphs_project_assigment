'''''Hygrocybe coccinea''''', sometimes called the '''scarlet hood''', '''scarlet waxcap''' or '''righteous red waxy cap''', is a colourful fungus of the genus ''[[Hygrocybe]]'', forming a small red (but indistinct) mushroom.

It is found across the [[Northern Hemisphere]], being a familiar sight in unimproved grasslands of Europe in late summer and autumn, and in woodlands of North America in winter. It is [[Edible mushroom|edible]] but of low interest.

==Taxonomy==
The scarlet hood was first described as ''Agaricus coccineus'' by German mycologist [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] in 1774, before being transferred to the genus ''[[Hygrophorus]]'' by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838, and finally ''[[Hygrocybe]]'' by [[Paul Kummer]] in 1871. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''coccinea'' is [[Latin]] for "scarlet".

==Description==
A small waxcap with an initially bell-shaped, and later flattening, [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] {{Convert|2–5|cm|frac=4}} across, scarlet in colour and slimy in texture. The adnate gills are thick and widely spaced, yellow red in colour. The ringless [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 2–5&nbsp;cm tall and {{Convert|0.3–1|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide, red with a yellowish base. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is yellowish-red and the smell and taste faint. The oval [[Basidiospore|spores]] measure 7–9.5 x 4–5 [[μm]] and produce a white [[spore print]].<ref name=Nilper77/><ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | last = Phillips | first = Roger | year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms | page = 75 | publisher = Pan MacMillan|location=London | isbn = 978-0-330-44237-4}}</ref>
