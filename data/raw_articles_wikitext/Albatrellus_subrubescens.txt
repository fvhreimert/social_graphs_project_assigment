'''''Albatrellus subrubescens''''' is a species of [[polypore]] [[fungus]] in the family [[Albatrellaceae]]. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) of the fungus have whitish to pale [[buff (color)|buff]]-colored [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] that can reach up to {{convert|14.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, and [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] up to {{convert|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. On the underside of the caps are tiny light yellow to pale greenish-yellow pores, the site of [[spore]] production. When the fruit bodies are fresh, the cap and pores stain yellow where exposed, handled, or bruised.

The species is found in Asia, Europe, and North America, where it grows on the ground in [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] or [[mixed forest|mixed woods]], usually in association with [[pine]] trees. It is closely related, and physically similar, to the more common ''[[Albatrellus ovinus]]'', from which it may be distinguished macroscopically by differences in the color when bruised, and microscopically by the [[amyloid]] ([[staining]] bluish-black to black with [[Melzer's reagent]]) walls of the spores. The fruit bodies of ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' contain scutigeral, a [[biological activity|bioactive]] chemical that has [[antibiotic]] activity. ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' mushrooms are mildly [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], and consuming them will result in a short-term [[gastroenteritis|gastrointestinal illness]].

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

The species was first [[species description|described]] as ''Scutiger subrubescens'' by American [[mycology|mycologist]] [[William Murrill]] in 1940, based on collections that he found growing under [[oak]] near [[Gainesville, Florida]], in November 1938.<ref name="Murrill 1940"/> In 1947 he transferred it to the genus ''[[Polyporus]]''.<ref name="Murrill 1947"/> [[Josiah Lincoln Lowe]] examined Murrill's [[type (biology)|type]] material and thought that it did not differ from ''[[Albatrellus confluens]]''.<ref name="Overholts 1953"/> In 1965, [[Zdeněk Pouzar]] made collections from [[Bohemia]] (now the Czech Republic), and described it as a new species (''Albatrellus similis''), unaware of the similarity to Murrill's Florida specimens.<ref name="Pouzar 1966"/> Further study revealed that ''A.&nbsp;similis'' was identical to Murrill's ''Scutiger subrubescens'', and Pouzar transferred the latter [[botanical name|epithet]] to ''[[Albatrellus]]''.<ref name="Pouzar 1972"/> In 1974, Pouzar recognized that Lowe's species ''Albatrellus confluens'' was distinct from ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens''.<ref name="Pouzar 1974"/> The specific epithet ''subrubescens'', "tinted reddish", is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''sub'' ("less than") and ''rubescens'' ("growing red").<ref name="Headrick 2001"/>

}}
Four ''Albatrellus'' species were included in a large-scale [[phylogenetic]] analysis of the order [[Russulales]] published in 2003. Based on their [[ribosomal DNA]] sequences, the four form a [[clade]], or [[monophyletic]] group (that is, they derived from a single ancestor). Of the four tested species, ''A.&nbsp;ovinus'' was most closely related to ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens''. The polypore ''[[Wrightoporia lenta]]'' ([[type species]] of the genus ''[[Wrightoporia]]'') occurred on a single branch [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] to the albatrellus clade, implying that it shared with the ''Albatrellus'' species a [[Common descent|common ancestor]] from which both were descended.<ref name="Larsson 2003"/> In a more recent (2010) [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis by Canadian mycologist Serge Audet aimed at clarifying relationships among species formerly placed in ''[[Scutiger (fungus)|Scutiger]]'', ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' grouped in a clade with ''A.&nbsp;ovinus'' and ''A.&nbsp;citrinus''. According to Audet, these species, in addition to ''[[Albatrellus avellaneus|A.&nbsp;avellaneus]]'' and ''[[Albatrellus piceiphilus|A.&nbsp;piceiphilus]]'', are the constituents of an ''Albatrellus'' with limits defined by molecular genetics. Other ''Albatrellus'' species were transferred to segregate genera: ''[[Albatrellopsis flettii|A.&nbsp;fletti]]'' and ''A.&nbsp;confluens'' to ''[[Albatrellopsis]]''; ''[[Neoalbatrellus caeruleoporus|A.&nbsp;caeruleoporus]]'' and ''[[Neoalbatrellus yasudae|A.&nbsp;yasudae]]'' to ''[[Neoalbatrellus]]''; ''[[Scutiger pes-caprae|A.&nbsp;pes-caprae]]'' and ''[[Scutiger ellisii|A.&nbsp;ellisii]]'' to an amended ''Scutiger''.<ref name="Audet 2010"/>

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' is between {{convert|6|and|14.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, with a central, eccentric (away from the center), or rarely lateral (attached to the edge of cap) stem. Initially, the cap is convex with an [[wikt:involute|involute]] margin, flattening out with age. The cap margin may be folded or flat. The cap surface in young specimens is smooth but soon forms [[wikt:appressed|appressed]] scale-like spots, which may transform into scales in age. Initially, the cap has white margins and a brownish-violet center with scale-like spots; the center later becomes orange-brownish or [[Ochre|ochraceous]] brown. According to Canadian mycologist James Ginns, who described North American ''Albatrellus'' species in 1997, some North American specimens may be covered with blackish-gray to purple-gray fibrils,<ref name="Ginns 1997"/> but this characteristic is not seen in European collections.<ref name="Pouzar 1975"/> The cap discolors yellowish when bruised.<ref name="Ginns 1997"/>

The stem is {{convert|1.6|to|7|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, irregular, and its base may be somewhat pointed, or bulbous. Initially white, the stem develops orange/violet spots and later brownish orange spots; in old specimens the stem may be brownish brick red. The tubes on the pore surface (underside of the cap) are about 2.5–3&nbsp;mm long and [[decurrent]] in attachment. The pores are small, measuring about 2–3 per millimeter. They are initially greenish-white, but later turn dark brown; dried specimens can have pores that are tinted green.<ref name="Pouzar 1975"/> Fruit bodies have a "faintly fragrant, pleasant" odor;<ref name="Ginns 1997"/> in his original report on the species, Murrill noted that specimens left to dry in an oven developed a strong odor of burnt sugar.<ref name="Murrill 1940"/> The taste of the mushroom has been described variously as indistinct,<ref name="Ginns 1997"/> or "distinctly bitter".<ref name="Ryvarden1 1993"/> The type material was noted by Murrill to taste bitter, an observation later corroborated by Pouzar with European collections.<ref name="Pouzar 1974"/> ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' mushrooms are mildly [[mushroom poisoning|toxic]]: consumption causes a [[gastroenteritis|gastrointestinal illness]] that usually subsides one to four hours after ingestion.<ref name="Angeli 2009"/> However, some sources in Finland consider it edible, although it is quite rare there.<ref>''Kosonen Lasse: Sienenmetsästystä. Tunnista parhaat ruokasienet. Helsinki: WSOY, 2015''. ISBN 978-951-0-48491-3, p. 243: ''Jos hiekkapohjaiselta mäntykankaalta löytää myöhään syksyllä lampaankäävän näköisen, pienemmän ja ohutmaltoisemman sienen, joka myös kellertyy, mutta jalan tyvessä on usein punaista väriä, kyseessä on vuohenkääpä, A.&nbsp;subrubescens. Se on melko harvinainen, mutta on myös syötävä.'' (In Finnish)</ref>


In [[spore print|deposit]], the spores are white.<ref name="Bessette 2007"/> The [[spore]]s are 3.4–4.7 by 2.2–3.4&nbsp;[[micrometer (unit)|μm]], [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] to [[wikt:ovoid|ovoid]] in shape, and [[amyloid]] (absorbing [[iodine]] when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]). Most have a single large oil drop. The spore-bearing cells (the [[basidia]]) are club-shaped, 12–16&nbsp;μm long by 5.7–7.7&nbsp;μm thick, and have four thin, slightly curved [[sterigmata]] that are 3.4–4.3&nbsp;μm long.<ref name="Pouzar 1975"/> The hymenium lacks any [[cystidia]].<ref name="Ryvarden1 1993"/> The hyphal system is monomitic, meaning that the [[trama (mycology)|context]] is made of thin-walled generative [[hypha]]e. These hyphae have lengths in the range of 3.5–30&nbsp;μm (most commonly 6–17&nbsp;μm), with thin walls (up to 1&nbsp;μm thick), and are [[hyaline]] (translucent). Although they are inamyloid, some hyphae have internal masses that are colored pale bluish-gray to black, which makes them appear collectively grayish-black under the [[light microscope|microscope]].<ref name="Ginns 1997"/> Gloeoporous hyphae (wide and thin-walled with [[refraction|refractive]] contents) are also scattered throughout the context, as well as some hyphae with expanded tips that are thick-walled and amyloid.<ref name="Ryvarden1 1993"/>

In general, ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' can be distinguished from other ''Albatrellus'' species by its white cap that becomes orange when bruised, its simple-septate hyphae, small amyloid spores, and habitat under [[pine]]s.<ref name="Zheng 2008"/> In the field, ''Albatrellus ovinus'' is difficult to differentiate from ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' due to its similar appearance. ''A.&nbsp;ovinus'' usually lacks the violet color often seen in the cap and stem of ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens''. Microscopic characteristics can be used to reliably distinguish the two species: the spores of ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' are amyloid, in contrast to those of ''A.&nbsp;ovinus'',<ref name="Jülich 1984"/> and ''A.&nbsp;ovinus'' spores are smaller, typically 3.8–4.6 by 3.3–3.5&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Pouzar 1972"/> Other similar species include ''A.&nbsp;tianschanicus'', described from the [[Altai Mountains]] in East-Central Asia, and the Japanese species ''[[Albatrellus cantharellus|A.&nbsp;cantharellus]]''. Unlike ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'', these species have hairy scales on the surface of their caps, and the scales are darker than the spaces between the scales. Also, the scales of ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' are not much darker than the area between the scales.<ref name="Pouzar 1972"/> Both of these Asian species have larger spores than ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'': those of ''A.&nbsp;cantharellus'' are 4.5–7 by 4–5.5&nbsp;μm, while those of ''A.&nbsp;tianschanicus'' are 5–7 by 4–5&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Ryman 2003"/>

''Albatrellopsis confluens'' has caps that are pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]] to pale orange, and white flesh that dries to a pinkish-buff; it has a taste that is bitter, or like cabbage. The spores of ''A.&nbsp;confluens'' are weakly amyloid.<ref name="Bessette 2007"/> Additional differences distinguishing ''Albatrellopsis confluens'' from ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' include the presence of [[clamp connection]]s in the context hyphae, and [[mycelium]] on the base of the stem.<ref name="Pouzar 1974"/> The European fungus ''A.&nbsp;citrinus'', originally considered a [[morphotype]] of ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'', was described as a new species in 2003. It is distinguished from ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' morphologically by its smaller caps (up to {{convert|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter), the yellowish bruising of the caps with age or after handling, and the absence of violet spots on the cap. ''A.&nbsp;citrinus'' associates with [[spruce]] rather than pine, and requires [[calcareous]] (lime-rich) soil.<ref name="Ryman 2003"/>

==Habitat and distribution==

Fruit bodies of ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' are usually solitary, but sometimes several (typically between two and eight) are stuck together by the stem bases or on the sides of their caps.<ref name="Ginns 1997"/> A strictly [[Terrestrial plant|terrestrial]] species, it is not found fruiting on wood. It prefers to grow in pine woods, but has occasionally been associated with [[Abies alba|silver fir]] in Europe; fruit bodies associated with the latter tree species tend to be less robust than those found growing with pine.<ref name="Pouzar 1974"/> It is suspected that ''A.&nbsp;subrubescens'' may be [[mycorrhiza]]l with two- and three-needle pines (i.e., those species that have their needles attached in bundles of two or three), although its ecological preferences are not known with certainty. Ginns, relating a personal communication with [[David Arora]], wrote that Arora encountered several clumps of fruit bodies in an area in [[California]] containing mostly [[knobcone pine]] (a three-needle pine), [[manzanita]], [[huckleberry]] and a few mandrones.<ref name="Ginns 1997"/>

The species has been reported from a variety of locations in [[temperate]] regions of Asia, Europe, and North America.<ref name="urlSWIMS POLYPORES"/><ref name="Canfield 1971"/> In North America, its distribution includes [[Alberta]], [[Quebec]], and the [[Northwest Territories]] in Canada. In the United States, it is found in [[Alabama]], [[Arizona]], California, Florida, [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[Wisconsin]].<ref name="Pouzar 1974"/><ref name="Ginns 1997"/><ref name="Bessette 2007"/> The North American distribution extends south to Mexico, in [[Chiapas]].<ref name="Valenzuela 1994"/><ref name="Gonzalez Espinoza 2005"/> In Asia, the fungus has been recorded from [[Yunnan]] in southwest China, and [[Tibet]].<ref name="Zheng 2008"/> In Europe, collections have been reported from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, and Ukraine.<ref name="Pouzar 1974"/>

==Bioactive compounds==

''Albatrellus subrubescens'' contains the [[Bioactive compound|bioactive]] compound scutigeral, which has [[antibiotic]] activity. This chemical—also found in the related species ''A.&nbsp;ovinus''<ref name="Cole 2003"/>—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's [[intestinal flora]].<ref name="Bresinsky 1989"/> Scutigeral interacts selectively to the [[Dopamine receptor D1|dopamine receptor D<sub>1</sub> subfamily]] (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating [[neuron]]al growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses).<ref name="Dekermendjian 1996"/> A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has [[agonist]]ic activity at [[vanilloid receptor]]s (a [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] found on [[sensory nerve]]s in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of [[calcium]] in the neurons of rat [[dorsal root ganglia]].<ref name="Szallasi 1999"/> Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak [[antagonist]] on the [[TRPV1|human vanilloid receptor VR1]],<ref name="Hellwig 2003"/> while another study published that year did not find any activity.<ref name="Ralevic 2003"/>
