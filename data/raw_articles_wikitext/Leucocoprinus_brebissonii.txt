In 1953 the Japanese mycologist [[Tsuguo Hongo]] documented a species from [[Ōtsu]], Japan which he classified as ''Leucocoprinus otsuensis'' having previously classified it as ''Lepiota otsuensis''. Hongo noted that the species was very similar to ''L.&nbsp;brebissonii'' but that it could be distinguished from it by the squamules (scales) on the cap.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hongo |first=Tsugno |date=March 1953 |title=Larger fungi of the provinces of Omi and Yamashiro |url=http://www.jjbotany.com/pdf/JJB_028_69_75.pdf |journal=The Journal of Japanese Botany |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=70–72 |via=www.jjbotany.com/}}</ref> These may now be considered synonyms of ''Leucocoprinus brebissonii'' although some sources list ''Lepiota otsuensis'' as the current name.

==Description==
''Leucocoprinus brebissonii'' is a small, delicate mushroom with thin white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] that is brittle and prone to splitting at the cap edges.

'''[[Pileus (mycology)|Cap]]:''' 2-3cm wide and starting hemispherical or bulbous before flattening with age with a small dark brownish [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]] which is often quite shallow. The cap surface can be darker and brownish when young but as it opens the brown colouration breaks up and the surface lightens to white with fine brown scales radiating out from the centre and largely absent towards the edges. Distinct, deep striations or grooves spread from the edges of the cap to around halfway up the surface or almost to the disc. '''[[Lamella (mycology)|Gills:]]''' Free, crowded and white. '''[[Stipe (mycology)|Stem:]]''' 3-7cm tall and 3-6mm thick and roughly equal in thickness across its length or tapering slightly to the base, which can be bulbous but may not be as pronounced as in other ''[[Leucocoprinus]]'' species. The surface is smooth and white but may have a light brownish tint with age. The small, movable stem ring is usually located in the middle or towards the top of the stem however the ring is fragile and often peels away or vanishes. '''[[Spore print]]:''' White. '''[[Basidiospore|Spores:]]''' Ellipsoid to amygdaloid with a [[germ pore]]. Dextrinoid. 8.5-10.5 x 5.5-6.5 μm. '''Smell:''' Indistinct. '''Taste:''' Indistinct.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Buczacki |first=Stefan |title=Collins fungi guide |date=2012 |publisher=Collins |isbn=978-0-00-724290-0 |location=London |oclc=793683235}}</ref><ref name="urlRogers">{{cite web |title=''Leucocoprinus brebissonii'' |author=Phillips, Roger |url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~6328~gid~~source~gallerydefault.asp |work=Rogers Mushrooms |access-date=2011-05-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823102408/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/DisplayBlock~bid~6328~gid~~source~gallerydefault.asp |archive-date=2012-08-23 }}</ref>''<ref name=":3" />''

==Distribution and habitat==
''Leucocoprinus brebissonii'' is found in Europe and North America from summer to fall, where it grows in the soil in woods with [[deciduous]] trees.

In 1874 Godey documented ''Lepiota brebissoni'' growing in the [[Cerisy Forest]] of the [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]] region of [[France]] during the summer. He noted that it was solitary and rare.''<ref name=":3" />''

==Edibility==
Unknown, but suspected to be poisonous.<ref name="urlRogers"/>

==Similar species==
The species resembles ''Lepiota atrodisca''; the authors of one field guide speculate that ''L. brebissonii'' may have been mistakenly identified as this species, explaining why it was previously overlooked in North America.<ref name="Trudell2009">{{cite book |last1=Trudell |first1=Steve |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest |last2=Ammirati |first2=Joe |publisher=[[Timber Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5 |location=Portland, OR |page=77}}</ref>
