'''''Suillus viscidus''''' ([[common name|commonly known]] as the '''sticky bolete''') is an edible, uncommon [[mushroom]] in the genus ''[[Suillus]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Wild edible fungi: a global overview of their use and importance to people |last=Boa |first=E. R. |year=2004 |publisher=Food & Agriculture Org. |isbn=978-92-5-105157-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Zd2NlcNZgvcC/page/n148 139] |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Zd2NlcNZgvcC}}</ref> It associates with [[larch]] and is found throughout Europe and in Japan.

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is hemispherical when young, later convex to flat, whitish grey or darker. It is up to 12&nbsp;cm in diameter. It is slimy, and blotchy when old. The large, angular [[Hymenium|pores]] on the underside of the cap are coloured pallid to yellowish at first, but become darker with maturity. Young specimens bear a whitish [[partial veil]] which soon shreds, sometimes leaving fragments on the cap edge.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=225–226}}</ref> The [[Hymenium|tubes]] are concolorous, and have a slightly decurrent stem attachment. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] bears a thin, slimy, dark-coloured [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] in the uppermost part of the stem which is sometimes lost in mature specimens. The stem is divided by the ring into a short lighter, yellowish section above, and a duller, greyish section below, which is viscid.<ref name=":0" /> The flesh is whitish, staining bluish,<ref name=":0" /> very soft and has a mild or non-distinct taste.<ref name=Garnweidner>{{cite book |author=Garnweidner E. |title=Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and Europe |publisher=Collins |year=1994 }}</ref><ref name=Jordan>{{cite book |author=Jordan M. |title=The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe |publisher=David & Charles |location=London |year=1995 |page=349 |isbn=0-7153-0129-2}}</ref>

The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are clay-coloured and ellipsoid or subfusiform in shape. Their dimensions are 10–12 by 4–5.5&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Jordan/>

It is an [[edible mushroom]] of low quality.<ref name=Jordan/><ref name=Laessoe>{{cite book|author= Læssøe Th., Del Conte A. |year=1996|title=The Mushroom Book|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|page=214|isbn=0-7513-0258-9}}</ref>

==Habitat==
''Suillus viscidus'' forms an [[Mycorrhiza#Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] association with [[larch]] (''Larix'') specifically, and its distribution is thus limited by the range of the host tree. It occurs throughout Europe, and also in Japan.<ref name=Shironumeriiguchi>{{cite web |url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/mediart/takutaku/kinoko/i-sironum.htm |title=Shironumeriiguchi |language=ja |access-date=2010-09-17}}</ref> In Europe, it is considered an uncommon to rare fungus and it is to be found in the same habitat as the common larch bolete, ''[[Suillus grevillei]]'', and also the rare ''[[Suillus tridentinus]]''.<ref name=Jordan/> Fruiting bodies are found in groups among grass under larch, from summer to autumn.<ref name=Laessoe/>
