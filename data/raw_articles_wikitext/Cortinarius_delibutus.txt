'''''Cortinarius delibutus''''', also known as the '''bluegill webcap''' or the '''yellow webcap''', is a [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] of the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are medium-sized, with shiny yellow [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] on a sticky, yellow-banded club-shaped [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The mushroom is found in Europe and North America, usually near [[birch]] or [[beech]] trees.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838.<ref name=Fries1838/>

It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "bluegill webcap",<ref name=McKnight1987/> or the "yellow webcap".<ref name=EnglishCommonNames/>

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|4|–|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially pale yellow then darker as it matures, and sandy in the middle. It has a campanulate (like a bell) to convex shape, later becoming flattened, with a very blunt [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The cap is fleshy in the center, but becomes thinner towards the margin. Its surface is smooth and sticky, but eventually becomes covered with silky fibers. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded together, broad, adnexed, and slightly emarginate (notched) at the stem. They are bluish when young, later turning cinnamon as the [[spore]]s mature. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|5|–|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and about {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick, measuring up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick in the swollen part of the base. It is quite flexible, faintly bluish at the top when young, white when mature with a faint tinge of yellow, smooth, sticky or shiny, and with a cortina at the top forming an annular zone. It is narrower at the apex and usually clavately thickened at the base, stuffed, then hollow. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, then slightly yellowish, soft, with mild taste, sometimes slightly bitter when mature, with no distinguishable odor.<ref name=Pilat1961/> The mushroom is inedible.<ref name=Jordan2004/>

The [[spore]]s are spherical to egg-shaped, drawn into an apiculus at the base, pale rust colored and coarsely verrucose (wart-like), measuring 7–8 by 6.3–6.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are 25–30 by 9–10&nbsp;μm. The [[spore print|spore deposit]] is ochraceous rust.<ref name=Pilat1961/>

===Similar species===
''[[Cortinarius lewisii]]'' has a dry yellow cap, a dry cream-colored stem with a white basal mycelium, and a dense white yellow partial veil, and flesh that has a musky to radish musky odor.<ref name=Bessette2007/>

==Distribution and habitat==
The fruit bodies of ''C. delibutus'' grow scattered or in groups on the ground in [[mixed forest|mixed]] and [[deciduous forest|deciduous woods]] in the autumn, mainly beneath [[birch]]es and [[aspen]]s (usually in groups) throughout the [[temperate]] zone of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].<ref name=Pilat1961/> In North America, the fungus is found in the northern U.S. and Canada.<ref name=McKnight1987/>

Fruit bodies are a source of food for the squirrel ''[[Sciurus vulgaris]]''.<ref name="Grönwall1984"/>
