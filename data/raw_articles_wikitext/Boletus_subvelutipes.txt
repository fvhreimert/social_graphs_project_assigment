'''''Boletus subvelutipes''''', commonly known as the '''red-mouth bolete''', is a [[bolete]] fungus in the family [[Boletaceae]]. The fruit bodies (mushrooms) have a brown to reddish-brown cap, bright yellow cap flesh, and a stem covered by furfuraceous to punctate ornamentation and dark red hairs at the base. The mushroom rapidly stains blue when sliced or bruised.

It is found in Asia and North America, where it fruits on the ground in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association with both [[deciduous]] and [[conifer]]ous trees. The fruit bodies are [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]], causing [[gastroenteritis]]-like symptoms if consumed.

== Taxonomy ==
The species was originally described by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1889 from specimens collected in [[Saratoga, New York]].<ref name="Peck 1889"/> In 1947 [[Rolf Singer]] described form ''glabripes'' from specimens he collected in [[Alachua County]], [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], [[Florida]].<ref name="Singer 1947"/> [[synonym (biology)|Synonyms]] include names resulting from generic transfers to the genera ''[[Suillus]]'' by [[Otto Kuntze]] in 1888,<ref name="Smith 1971"/> and to ''Suillelus'' by [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1948.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Boletus subvelutipes"/>

The mushroom is commonly known as the "red-mouth bolete".<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> In his original description, Peck called it the "velvety-stemmed bolete".<ref name="Peck 1889"/>

The cap is initially convex, but flattens out as it matures, attaining a diameter of {{convert|6–13|cm|abbr=on}} wide. The cap surface is dry, with a velvet-like texture when young, sometimes developing cracks in maturity. The cap color ranges from  cinnamon-brown to yellow-brown to reddish brown or reddish orange to orange-yellow. The bright yellow [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] has no distinctive taste or odor, and a taste ranging from mild to slightly acidic. The pore surface on the underside of the cap is variably colored: in young specimens, this ranges from  red to brownish red to dark maroon-red, or red-orange to orange; the color fades in older individuals. The circular pores number about 2 per millimeter, and the tubes comprising the [[hymenophore]] are {{convert|8–26|mm|abbr=on}} deep.

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3–10|cm|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1–2|cm|abbr=on}} thick, and nearly equal in width throughout its length. It is solid (i.e., not hollow) with a furfuraceous surface (appearing to be covered in bran-like particles), and mature individuals usually have short, stiff hairs at the base. All parts of the mushroom–cap, pore surface, flesh, and stipe–will quickly stain to dark blue if injured or cut.<ref name="Bessette 2000" /> The smell and taste are mild.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=329}}</ref>

''Boletus subvelutipes'' produces a dark olive-brown spore print. [[Spore]]s are roughly spindle-shaped to somewhat swollen in the middle, smooth, and measure 13–18 by 5–6.5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Bessette 2000"/>

===Similar species===
''[[Boletus gansuensis]]'', found in the [[Gansu Province]] of China, is similar in appearance to ''B.&nbsp;subvelutipes''. The Chinese species can be distinguished by longer and narrower spores measuring 12.0–15.5 by 6.0–7.0&nbsp;μm, smaller fruit bodies with a cap diameter of {{convert|6–8|cm|abbr=on}} and shorter tubes up to {{convert|1.2|cm|abbr=on}} deep.<ref name="Wang 2003"/> ''[[Suillellus]]'' species such as ''[[Suillellus luridus|S.&nbsp;luridus]]'' are similar, but usually have reddish netting on the upper stem.<ref name="audu" />

==Habitat and distribution==
The fruit bodies of ''B. subvelutipes'' grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in groups. A [[mycorrhiza]]l species, the fungus associates with [[deciduous]] trees, typically [[oak]], and also with [[pine]]s such as [[Tsuga|hemlock]].<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> Fruit bodies have a strong ability to capture and neutralize the chemical [[methyl mercaptan]], one of the main odiferous compounds associated with [[bad breath]].<ref name="Negishi 2001"/> This ability is conferred largely by the pigment [[variegatic acid]].<ref name="Negishi 2000"/>

In North America, it can be found from June to September.<ref name="audu" /> Its [[Species distribution|distribution]] includes eastern Canada and extends south to [[Florida]] and west to [[Minnesota]].<ref name="Bessette 2000"/> It is also in Mexico.<ref name="Landeros 2006"/> In Asia, it has also been found in the [[Central Mountain Range|central highlands]] of Taiwan<ref name="Yeh 1981"/> and in Japan.<ref name="Negishi 2001"/>

==Toxicity==
The fruit bodies are [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]], causing [[gastroenteritis]]-like symptoms if consumed.<ref name="Bessette 2000" />

== Uses ==
The mushrooms can be used in [[mushroom dye]]ing to produce beige or light brown colors, depending on the [[mordant]] used.<ref name="Bessette 2001" />
