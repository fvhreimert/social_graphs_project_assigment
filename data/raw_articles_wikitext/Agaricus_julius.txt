'''''Agaricus julius''''', commonly known as '''the emperor''' or '''the prince''', is a [[Basidiomycota|basidiomycete]] fungus of the genus ''[[Agaricus]]'', closely related to ''[[Agaricus augustus]]''.

== Taxonomy ==
''Agaricus julius'' was first described by American mycologist Richard W. Kerrigan in 2016.<ref>{{IndexFungorum|802562}}</ref>

== Description ==
The cap is {{cvt|5–15|cm}} wide, sometimes larger. The appearance of this mushroom is very similar to the store-bought [[Agaricus bisporus|portabello mushroom]]. It stains slightly yellow where damaged or nicked. The cap is light brown with a scaled pattern. When young, it has a cottony veil covering the gills. The mushroom can become quite large as the cap opens. The gills are initially pinkish-gray to pink when young, then turning brown at maturity; crowded; not attached to the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. The stipe is {{cvt|2–3|cm}} wide, and {{cvt|5-15|cm}} long. The stalk is usually shaggy when young, becoming smooth at maturity, curved with a larger bulbous base. Once the cap opens it leaves a thin yellowish to light brown [[Annulus (mycology)|skirt-like ring]] on the stipe. When mature, the stalk can turn darker above the ring. The cap flesh can stain yellow in fresh specimens where nicked or handled. It has a very distinct cherry-almond smell. The spore color is chocolate brown.<ref>{{cite web |title=Agaricus julius |last1=Kuo |first1=Michael |year=2018 |url=https://www.mushroomexpert.com/agaricus_julius.html |access-date=12 March 2025 |website=MushroomExpert.Com}}</ref>

== In culture ==
In March 2025, with the signing of bill HB25-1091,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1091|title=Designation of State Mushroom}}</ref> ''A. julius'' became the [[List of U.S. state mushrooms|state mushroom]] of [[Colorado]].
