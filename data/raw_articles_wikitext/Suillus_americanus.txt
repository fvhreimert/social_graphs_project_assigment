'''''Suillus americanus''''' is a species of [[fungus]] in the [[mushroom]] family [[Suillaceae]]. Commonly known as the '''chicken fat mushroom''' and the '''American suillus''', the mushroom can be recognized by the bright yellow [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with red to reddish-brown scales embedded in slime, the large yellow angular pores on the underside of the cap, and the narrow yellow [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] marked with dark reddish dots. [[Molecular phylogenetics]] analysis suggests that ''S.&nbsp;americanus'' may be the same species as ''[[Suillus sibiricus|S.&nbsp;sibiricus]]'', found in western North America and western and central Asia.    

''Suillus americanus'' grows in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association with [[eastern white pine]] and is found where this tree occurs in eastern North America and China. Susceptible individuals may suffer a [[contact dermatitis]] after touching the [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]]. The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], although opinions vary as to its [[palatability]]. The fruit bodies contain a [[beta glucan]] carbohydrate shown in laboratory tests to have [[anti-inflammatory]] properties.

==Taxonomy ==


''Suillus americanus'' was first described scientifically by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1888,<ref name=Peck1888/> based on specimens he had originally collected as far back as 1869, in [[New York (state)|New York]] state, near [[Sand Lake, New York|Sand Lake]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and [[Port Jefferson, New York|Port Jefferson]]. In his 1888 publication he indicated that he had originally listed these collections as ''Boletus flavidus'' (now known as ''[[Suillus flavidus]]'') in his 1869 ''Report of the State Botanist'' (published in 1872).<ref name=Peck1872/> However, as was pointed out nearly a century later in 1986, the 1869 report does not actually mention the species; rather, Peck's field notes that year (which served as the basis for the report) reference a collection at Sand Lake upon which the original (1888) description was most likely based. Because Peck failed to designate a [[type specimen]], one of the Sand Lake specimens was [[lectotype|lectotypified]] in 1986.<ref name=Palm1986/>

In 1931, French mycologist [[Édouard-Jean Gilbert]] transferred the species to the genus ''Ixocomus'',<ref name=Gilbert1931/> a now-defunct taxon that has since been [[wikt:subsume|subsumed]] into ''Suillus''.<ref name=Kirk2008/> In 1959, [[Wally Snell|Walter H. Snell]], collaborating with [[Rolf Singer]] and [[Esther A. Dick]], transferred the species to ''Suillus''.<ref name=Snell1959/> In his 1986 version of the authoritative [[monograph]] ''The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', Singer included the species in the [[subsection (botany)|subsection]] ''Latiporini'' of genus ''[[Suillus]]'', an infrageneric grouping (below the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] level of genus) characterized by a cinnamon-colored [[spore print]] without an olive tinge, and wide pores, typically greater than 1&nbsp;mm when mature.<ref name=Singer1986/>

[[Common name]]s for the species include the American slipperycap,<ref name="McKnight p.113">McKnight (1987), pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kSdA3V7Z9WcC&pg=PA113 113–14].</ref> the American suillus,<ref name=Russell2006/> or the chicken-fat mushroom. The latter name is a reference to its yellow color.<ref name="urlSuillus americanus TVFotM"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''americanus'' means "of America".<ref name="Smith1980"/>

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is typically between {{convert|3|–|10|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter, broadly convex with a small [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]] to flat with age. The margin is curved inwards in young specimens, and may have remnants of a yellowish, cottony [[Veil (mycology)|veil]] hanging from it. The cap surface is colored bright yellow with red or brownish streaks and hairy patches. When the fruit body is young and moist, the surface is slimy; as the cap matures and dries out, it becomes sticky or tacky.<ref name=Healy2008/>

The tubes which comprise the pore layer on the underside of the cap are {{convert|0.4|to|0.6|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} deep, and have an adnate (attached broadly to the stem) to [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]] (running down the length of the stem) attachment to the stem. They are yellow, and stain reddish-brown when bruised. The yellow pores are large (1–2&nbsp;mm diameter) and angular, and tend to become darker as they age.<ref name=Healy2008/> The pores are slightly wider than long, so that there are about 9–10 pores per cm measured radially, but 12 to 13 per cm when measured tangentially, about halfway to the edge.<ref name=Snell1959/>  As is the case with all boletes, [[basidiospore|spores]] form on the inner surfaces of the tubes and sift through their openings to be borne away on the air currents outside.

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3-9|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} by {{convert|0.4-1|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}}, roughly equal in width throughout, often crooked, and becomes hollow with age. The color of the stem surface is lemon yellow, and it is covered with glandular dots that bruise if handled. The [[partial veil]] is not attached to the stem, and usually does not leave a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the stem. A whitish [[mycelium]] present at the base of the stem helps anchor the fruit body in the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is mustard yellow, and stains pinkish-brown when cut or bruised.<ref name=Rogers/><ref name=Grund1976/>

===Microscopic characteristics===

In [[spore print|deposit]], the spores are cinnamon-colored.<ref name=Miller2006/> Viewed with a microscope, they are pale yellow, smooth, and roughly elliptical in shape, and measure 8–9.5 by 3.5–5&nbsp;[[μm]]. The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are club-shaped and 4-spored, with dimensions of 21–25 by 5.5 to 6&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Palm1986/> The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] found on the sides of a gill) range in shape from cylindrical to club-shaped and are arranged in bundles. Both the bases of the bundles and the surface of the cystidia may be covered with brown [[pigment]] particles. Cheilocystidia are cystidia located in the gill faces. In ''S.&nbsp;americanus'', they are mostly club-shaped, often with an expanded apex, and like the pleurocystidia, are arranged in bundles, with brown pigment particles at the base of the bundles.<ref name=Grund1976/> Bundles of cystidia near the tube openings may sometimes be visible with a [[hand lens]]. Like all ''Suillus'' species, the cystidia of ''S.&nbsp;americanus'' will turn orange-brown in the presence of a solution of 3%&nbsp;[[potassium hydroxide]].<ref name="urlSuillus americanus TVFotM"/>  The slimy layer on the cap surface results from an interwoven layer of gelatinous [[hypha]]e that are typically 3–5&nbsp;μm thick.<ref name=Grund1976/>

===Similar species===
''Suillus americanus'' is very similar in appearance to ''[[Suillus sibiricus]]'' (distributed in  western North America and western and central Asia) but the latter species associates with ''[[Pinus monticola]]'' and ''[[Pinus flexilis]]'' rather than ''[[Pinus strobus]]''.<ref name="urlSuillus sibiricus (MushroomExpert.Com)"/> One field guide suggests that ''S.&nbsp;sibiricus'' has a thicker stem than ''S.&nbsp;americanus'', brown spots on the cap, and is a darker, more dingy yellow.<ref name=Miller2006/> [[Molecular phylogenetics]] analysis has shown, however, that specimens of ''S.&nbsp;sibricus'' collected from China and western North America, as well as ''S.&nbsp;americanus'' from eastern North America, are most likely "a&nbsp;single circumboreal taxon".<ref name=Mueller2001/>

Another lookalike species is ''[[Suillus subaureus]]'', which can be distinguished microscopically by slightly smaller, [[hyaline]] (translucent) spores (typically 7.5–8.5 by 3&nbsp;μm), and an association with ''[[Populus tremuloides]]'' (quaking aspen).<ref name=Snell1959/>

==Habitat and distribution==


''Suillus americanus'' is a common species, and is found growing solitarily or in clusters on the ground throughout northeastern North America, north to Canada, where it typically fruits in the late summer and autumn.<ref name="McKnight p.113"/><ref name=Rogers/> It is also found in [[Guangdong]], China,<ref name=Bi1993/> an example of a [[disjunct distribution]]. Fruit bodies can often be found in drier weather when other species are not abundant.<ref name=Russell2006/>

''Suillus americanus'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species, a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship where the fungus forms a sheath on the surface of the root from which [[hypha]]e extend outward into the soil, and inwards between the [[cortex (botany)|cortical]] cells with which they interface to form a [[Hartig net]]. The main benefit for the fungus is constant access to a supply of [[carbohydrate]]s produced by the plant's [[photosynthesis]], while the plant benefits from an enhanced supply of [[dietary mineral|mineral nutrients]] from the soil, taken up by the hyphae of the fungus. It grows in association with pines, particularly [[eastern white pine]] (''Pinus strobus'').<ref name=Miller2006/>

==Allergenicity==

Some susceptible individuals have experienced an [[allergy|allergic reaction]] after touching ''S.&nbsp;americanus''. The symptoms of allergic [[contact dermatitis]] generally develop one to two days after initial contact, persist for roughly a week, then disappear without treatment.<ref name=Bruhn1991/> Cooking the fruit bodies inactivates the responsible allergens.<ref name="urlSuillus americanus TVFotM"/>

==Edibility==


This species is nonpoisonous<ref name="Miller2006" /> and sometimes regarded as [[edible mushroom|edible]], but opinions about its palatibility are mixed. It has no odor and its taste has been reported as mild.<ref name="Miller2006" /> One field guide suggests it has a "distinctive lemony tang",<ref>McKnight (1987), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kSdA3V7Z9WcC&pg=PA393 p. 393].</ref> and another says, "The yellow cap may remind you of chicken fat; it has a wonderfully savory mushroom flavor."<ref name=Brill2002/> The slimy texture of the mushroom has been compared to [[okra]].<ref name=Russell2006/> One cookbook author suggests that the mushroom is ideal for spreads, for use on bread or as a dip; baking the fruit bodies in an oven will dry them for future use, and concentrate the flavor.<ref name=Brill2002/>  The slimy caps and the pore layer are typically removed before consumption.<ref name=Bruhn1991/> Another field guide mentions that the "thin flesh hardly make this species worthwhile."<ref name="Grund1976" />

==Bioactive compounds==
''Suillus americanus'' contains a [[polysaccharide]] known as a [[beta glucan]] that laboratory tests suggest may have [[anti-inflammatory]] activity. Known specifically as a (1→3)-, (1→4)-β-D-glucan, its natural function is as a component of the fungal [[cell wall]], where it forms microcrystalline [[wikt:fibril|fibrils]] in the wall that give it rigidity and strength. The anti-inflammatory activity results from the polysaccharide's ability to inhibit the production of [[nitric oxide]] in activated [[macrophage]]s, a cell of the [[immune system]].<ref name="Pacheco-Sanchez2006"/>
