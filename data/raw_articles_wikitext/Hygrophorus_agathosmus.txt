'''''Hygrophorus agathosmus''''', commonly known as the '''gray almond waxy cap''' or the '''almond woodwax''', is a [[species]] of [[fungus]] in the family [[Hygrophoraceae]]. It was first described by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1815; Fries gave it its current name in 1838.

The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are characterized by a light grayish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that measures up to {{convert|8|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, waxy [[lamella (mycology)|gills]], a dry [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and the distinct odor of bitter [[almond]]s.

A widespread species, it is distributed in the United States, Europe, Africa, and India, and is found growing under [[spruce]] and [[pine]] in [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]].
An [[edible mushroom|edible]] but bland-tasting mushroom, extracts of the fruit bodies have been shown in laboratory tests to have [[antimicrobial]] activity against various bacteria that are [[pathogen]]ic to humans.

== Taxonomy ==
The species was originally named ''Agaricus agathosmus'' by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Fries]] in 1815;<ref name="Fries1815"/> he later moved it into the genus ''Hygrophorus'' in 1838.<ref name=Fries1838/> In the interim, English naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] named the species ''Agaricus cerasinus'' in 1836,<ref name="Berkeley1836"/> although he too would later transfer the species to ''Hygrophorus'' in 1860.<ref name="Berkeley1860"/> In 1948, [[R.W.G. Dennis|Richard Dennis]] examined the [[type material]], and concluded that the two names referred to the same species.<ref name="Dennis1948"/> Additional historical [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] include ''Limacium pustulatum'' var. ''agathosmum'' ([[Paul Kummer|Kummer]], 1871),<ref name=Kummer1871/> and ''Limacium agathosmum'' ([[Friedrich Otto Wünsche|Wünsch]], 1877).<ref name="urlMycoBank"/>

In their 1963 [[monograph]] of the ''Hygrophorus'' of North America, American mycologists [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] and [[Alexander H. Smith]] classified ''H.&nbsp;agathosmus'' in the [[subsection (botany)|subsection]] Camarophylli, a grouping of related species characterized by a dry stem, and the absence of a gelatinous outer [[partial veil|veil]].<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1963, p. 309.</ref>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''agathosmus'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''agathos'' meaning “good”, and ''osme'' meaning “scent”.<ref name="Quattrocchi1999"/> ''Hygrophorus agathosmus'' is [[common name|commonly]] known as the gray almond waxy cap,<ref name="Arora1986"/> or the almond woodwax.<ref name="BMS2003"/>

== Description ==


The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|3–10|cm|1|abbr=on}} in diameter,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=126–127|oclc=797915861}}</ref> and initially convex with the edges rolled inwards. As it ages and the cap expands, it becomes flat, sometimes with the center slightly depressed, or sometimes with a slight central elevation. The color is a dull ashy gray, and when moist, the cap surface is sticky or tacky to the touch. It is smooth, although the edges can have a layer of minute, soft hairs. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is soft, and whitish or watery gray. ''Hygrophorus agathosmus'' has a pronounced fragrant odor resembling cherry pits<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1963, p.10.</ref> or bitter almonds (occasionally the odor is weak).<ref name="Arora1986" />

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an adnate attachment to the stem, but in maturity the attachment becomes adnate-decurrent, meaning the gills start to extend down the length of the stem. The gills are white, but become grayish in maturity, close to distant (40–50 reach the stem), moderately narrow, rather thin. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|4–15|cm|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.6–2|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick,<ref name=":0" /> whitish at first, and colored pale ashy in age. It is the same thickness throughout or somewhat narrowed toward the base. It is solid, dry or moist but has no gelatinous [[universal veil]] present. When young, the stem surface is evenly covered with tiny [[wikt:fibril|fibrils]] and a fine whitish powder; over time it loses the hairs and the powder and becomes smooth.<ref name="Hesler1963"/>

=== Microscopic characteristics ===


When viewed in mass, such as with a [[spore print]], the spores appear to be white. Viewed with a light microscope, the [[basidiospore]]s are 8–10.5 by 4.5–5.5&nbsp;μm, [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, and yellowish in [[Melzer's reagent]]. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are four-spored and measure 48–65 long by 6–8&nbsp;μm thick. Pleurocystidia and cheilocystidia (specialized [[cystidia]] found on the gill faces and edges, respectively) are absent in this species. The [[pileipellis]] (cap cuticle) is made of a broad (175–350&nbsp;μm) gelatinous zone, composed of loosely interwoven, slender (1.5–4&nbsp;μm) hyphae; the surface [[hypha]]e are a [[wikt:fuscous|fuscous]]—a dark brownish-gray color. This hyphal arrangement is called an [[wiktionary:ixocutis|ixocutis]], in which the hyphal walls swell up and gelatinize, giving a translucence to the layer that stands out in contrast to the underlying flesh. The layer of gelatizined hyphae is tenacious, and may be peeled off the cap as a film.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1963, p. 27.</ref> Although [[clamp connection]]s are found on the hyphae that make up the flesh of the gill, none are found in the cap flesh nor in the pileipellis.<ref name="Hesler1963"/>

=== Similar species ===
''[[Hygrophorus pustulatus]]'' resembles ''H.&nbsp;agathosmus'' and has a similar almond odor. However, the fruit bodies of ''H.&nbsp;pustulatus'' are smaller, and it produces larger spores (11–14&nbsp;μm long). ''[[Hygrophorus occidentalis]]'', which grows under [[conifer]]s or [[oak]], has a sticky stem and less pronounced almond odor.<ref name=Arora1986/> ''[[Hygrophorus marzuolus]]'' is also similar in appearance, but it lacks a distinctive odor, and has smaller spores than ''H.&nbsp;agathamosus''.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1963, p. 329.</ref> ''Hygrophorus odoratus'' is similar, though smaller, and has the same odor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=66–67}}</ref>

== Habitat and distribution ==
''Hygrophorus agathosmus'' is an [[ectomycorrhiza]]l fungus, and it has been isolated, cultivated, and maintained as [[microbial culture|pure cultures]] of [[vegetative growth|vegetative]] fungal [[wikt:inoculum|inocula]] for artificial [[mycorrhiza]]tion of planting stock in forest [[plant nursery|nurseries]].<ref name=Repac1993/> Fruiting bodies are found scattered under [[spruce]] and [[pine]] and in [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed woods]] in the United States. The fungus is also found in Europe (Czech Republic,<ref name=Holec1997/> Poland,<ref name=Kornas1981/> Russia,<ref name=Kovalenko1999/> Turkey,<ref name=Demirel1998/> and the United Kingdom<ref name="urlNBN Gateway: Almond Woodwax (Hygrophorus agathosmus) grid map"/>), Africa, and India.<ref name=Manna1998/>

== Uses ==
''Hygrophorus agathosmus'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but considered bland.<ref name="Arora1986" /> A study of the [[antioxidant]] capacity of the mushroom was composed of at least five [[organic acid]]s: [[oxalic acid|oxalic]], [[citric acid|citric]], [[malic acid|malic]], quinic, and [[fumaric acid]]s.<ref name="Ribeiro2006" /> Using a standard laboratory test to determine antimicrobial activity, ''Hygrophorus agathosmus'' was shown to inhibit the growth of various [[pathogen]]ic bacteria, including ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Enterobacter aerogenes]]'', ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'', and ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''; it also inhibits the growth of the yeast ''[[Candida albicans]]'' and ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''.<ref name="Yamac2006" />
