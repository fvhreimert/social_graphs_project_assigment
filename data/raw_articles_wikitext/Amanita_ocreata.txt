'''''Amanita ocreata''''', commonly known as one of the many '''destroying angels''', or more precisely the '''western North American destroying angel''', is a deadly [[poison]]ous [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]], one of many in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. The large fruiting bodies (the [[mushroom]]s) generally appear in spring; the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] may be white or ochre and often develops a brownish centre, while the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], [[annulus (mycology)|ring]], [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] and [[volva (mycology)|volva]] are all white. ''A.&nbsp;ocreata'' resembles several edible species commonly consumed by humans, increasing the risk of accidental poisoning. Mature fruiting bodies can be confused with the edible ''[[Amanita velosa|A.&nbsp;velosa]]'' (springtime amanita),<ref>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |title=All That the Rain Promises and More: A Hip Pocket Guide to Western Mushrooms |date=February 1, 1991 |publisher=Ten Speed Press |isbn=978-0-89815-388-0}}</ref> ''[[Amanita lanei|A. lanei]]'' or ''[[Volvopluteus gloiocephalus]]'', while immature specimens may be difficult to distinguish from edible ''[[Agaricus]]'' mushrooms or puffballs.

The species occurs in the [[Pacific Northwest]] and [[California Floristic Province]]s of North America, [[mycorrhiza|associating]] with [[oak]] trees. Similar in toxicity to the death cap (''[[Amanita phalloides|A.&nbsp;phalloides]]'') and destroying angels of Europe (''[[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]]'') and eastern North America (''[[Amanita bisporigera|A.&nbsp;bisporigera]]''), it is a potentially deadly fungus responsible for several poisonings in California.<ref name="Amth77"/> Its principal toxic constituent, {{nowrap|[[α-Amanitin]]}}, damages the [[liver]] and [[kidney]]s, often fatally, and has no known antidote, though silybin and {{nowrap|N-acetylcysteine}} show promise.<ref name="Enjalbert"/> The initial symptoms are [[Gastrointestinal disease|gastrointestinal]] and include abdominal pain, [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]]. These subside temporarily after 2–3&nbsp;days, though ongoing damage to internal organs during this time is common; symptoms of [[jaundice]], diarrhea, [[delirium]], seizures, and [[coma]] may follow with death from liver failure 6–16&nbsp;days post ingestion.

==Taxonomy==
''Amanita ocreata'' was first described by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1909 from material collected by [[Charles Fuller Baker]] in [[Claremont, California]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Peck|first=Charles Horton|year=1909|title=New species of fungi.|journal=Bull.

The mushroom belongs to the same [[section (botany)|section]] (''Phalloideae'') and genus (''Amanita'') as several deadly poisonous fungi including the death cap (''A.&nbsp;phalloides'') and several all-white species of ''Amanita'' known as "destroying angels": ''[[Amanita bisporigera|A. bisporigera]]'' of eastern North America, and the European ''[[Amanita virosa|A.&nbsp;virosa]]''. "Death angel" is used as an alternate common name.

==Description==
''Amanita ocreata'' is generally stouter than the other fungi termed destroying angels. It first appears as a white egg-shaped object covered with a universal [[veil (botany)|veil]]. As it grows, the mushroom breaks free, though there may rarely be ragged patches of veil left at the cap edges. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially hemispherical, before becoming more convex and flattening, sometimes irregularly. This may result in undulations in the cap, which may be between {{Convert|5–15|cm|abbr=off|frac=4}} in diameter.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last1=Davis |first1=R. Michael |title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America |last2=Sommer |first2=Robert |last3=Menge |first3=John A. |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-520-95360-4 |location=Berkeley |page=74 |oclc=797915861 }}</ref> The colour varies from white, through yellowish-white to shades of ochre, sometimes with a brownish centre. Occasionally parts of the fruiting bodies may have pinkish tones. The rest of the fungus below the cap is white. The crowded [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnate to adnexed, or sometimes later free.<ref name="arora86" />

The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] ranges from {{Convert|6–20|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} in height and is about {{Convert|1–3|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick, bearing a thin white membranous [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] until old age.<ref name=":0" /> The [[volva (mycology)|volva]] is thin, smooth and sac-like,<ref name=":0" /> although may be quite extensive and contain almost half the stipe. The [[spore print]] is white, and the [[wiktionary:globose|subglobose]] to [[wiktionary:ovoid|ovoid]] to [[wiktionary:ellipsoid|subellipsoid]], [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] spores are 9–14 x 7–10&nbsp;[[μm]] viewed under a microscope.<ref name="Amth77" /> There is typically no smell, though some fruiting bodies may have a slight odour, described as that of bleach or [[chlorine]], dead fish or [[iodine]]. Like other destroying angels, the flesh stains yellow when treated with [[potassium hydroxide]].<ref name="Thiers">Thiers HD. (1982). ''The Agaricales (Gilled Fungi) of California 1: Amanitaceae''.

===Similar species===
This fungus resembles the edible mushrooms ''[[Agaricus arvensis]]'' and ''[[Agaricus campestris|A.&nbsp;campestris]]'', and the puffballs (''[[Lycoperdon]]'' spp.) before the caps have opened and the gills have become visible, so those collecting immature fungi run the risk of confusing the varieties. It also resembles and grows in the same areas as the edible and prized ''[[Amanita velosa]]'', which can be distinguished from ''A. ocreata'' by its lack of ring, [[wikt:striate|striate]] cap margin and thick [[universal veil]] remnants comprising the veil.<ref name="arora86">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/271/mode/2up |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=271–73}}</ref> The edible ''[[Amanita calyptroderma]]'' lacks a ring and is more likely to have veil patches remaining on its cap, which is generally darker.

==Distribution and habitat==
Appearing from January to April, ''A.&nbsp;ocreata'' occurs later in the year than other amanitas except ''A. calyptroderma''.

==Toxicity==

''A. ocreata'' is highly toxic, and has been responsible for [[mushroom poisoning]]s in western North America, particularly in the spring. It contains highly toxic [[amatoxin]]s, as well as [[phallotoxin]]s, a feature shared with the closely related death cap (''[[Amanita phalloides|A. phalloides]]''), half a cap of which can be enough to kill a human, and other species known as destroying angels.<ref name="Amth77"/><ref name="benjamin211">Benjamin, ''Mushrooms: poisons and panaceas'' p. 211</ref> There is some evidence it may be the most toxic of all the North American phalloideae, as a higher proportion of people consuming it had organ damage and 40% perished.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Beug |first=Michael |date=April 2006 |title=Reflections on Mushroom Poisoning – Part I |journal=Fungifama |pages=3–5 |url=http://www.svims.ca/ff0604.pdf |access-date=2007-12-11 |archive-date=2016-03-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175527/http://www.svims.ca/ff0604.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Dogs have also been known to consume this fungus in California with fatal results.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tegzes |first=John H.|author2=Birgit Puschner|year=2002 |title=Amanita mushroom poisoning: efficacy of aggressive treatment of two dogs |journal=Veterinary and Human Toxicology |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=96–99 |pmid=11931514}}</ref>

===Signs and symptoms===
Signs and symptoms of poisoning by ''A.&nbsp;ocreata'' are initially [[gastrointestinal]] in nature and include [[Biliary colic|colicky]] abdominal pain, with watery [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]] which may lead to [[dehydration]] and, in severe cases, [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], [[hypoglycemia]], and [[acid–base physiology|acid-base disturbances]].<ref name="pinson"/><ref name="klein"/> The initial symptoms resolve two to three days after ingestion of the fungus. A more serious deterioration signifying liver involvement may then occur—[[jaundice]], diarrhea, [[delirium]], [[seizure]]s, and [[coma]] due to [[fulminant liver failure]] and attendant [[hepatic encephalopathy]] caused by the accumulation of normally liver-removed substances in the blood.<ref name = "North67">{{cite book |last=North |first=Pamela Mildred |year=1967 |title=Poisonous plants and fungi in colour|location=London |publisher=Blandford Press|oclc=955264}}</ref> [[Kidney failure]] (either secondary to severe [[hepatitis]]<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nicholls DW, Hyne BE, Buchanan P |title=Death cap mushroom poisoning |journal=The New Zealand Medical Journal |volume=108 |issue=1001 |page=234 |year=1995 |pmid=7603660}}</ref><ref name = "Vetter">{{cite journal|first=János| last=Vetter|date=January 1998|title=Toxins of ''Amanita phalloides''|journal=Toxicon|volume=36|issue=1 |pages=13–24|pmid=9604278| doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(97)00074-3| bibcode=1998Txcn...36...13V}}</ref> or caused by direct toxic renal damage)<ref name=" Karlson-Stiber"/> and [[coagulopathy]] may appear during this stage.

===Treatment===
Consumption of ''A. ocreata'' is a [[medical emergency]] that requires hospitalization. There are four main categories of therapy for poisoning: preliminary medical care, supportive measures, specific treatments, and [[liver transplantation]].<ref name="Enjalbert">{{cite journal |vauthors=Enjalbert F, Rapior S, Nouguier-Soulé J, Guillon S, Amouroux N, Cabot C |title=Treatment of amatoxin poisoning: 20-year retrospective analysis |journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology |volume=40 |issue=6 |pages=715–57 |year=2002 |pmid=12475187 |doi=10.1081/CLT-120014646|s2cid=22919515 }}</ref>

Preliminary care consists of gastric decontamination with either [[activated carbon]] or [[gastric lavage]]. However, due to the delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions.<ref name="Enjalbert"/><ref name="Vesconi">{{cite journal |vauthors=Vesconi S, Langer M, Iapichino G, Costantino D, Busi C, Fiume L |title=Therapy of cytotoxic mushroom intoxication |journal=Critical Care Medicine |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=402–6 |year=1985 |pmid=3987318 |doi=10.1097/00003246-198505000-00007|s2cid=23016936 }}</ref> Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of [[metabolic acidosis]], hypoglycemia, [[electrolyte]] imbalances, and impaired coagulation.<ref name="Enjalbert"/>

No definitive antidote for amatoxin poisoning is available, but some specific treatments such as intravenous [[Benzylpenicillin|penicillin G]] have been shown to improve survival.<ref name="Floer82">{{cite journal|vauthors=Floerscheim GL, Weber O, Tschumi P, Ulbrich M |date=August 1982|title=Clinical death-cap (''Amanita phalloides'') poisoning: Prognostic factors and therapeutic measures|journal=Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift |volume=112 |issue=34 |pages=1164–1177 |pmid=6291147|language=de}}</ref> There is some evidence that intravenous [[silibinin]], an extract from the [[Silybum marianum|blessed milk thistle]] (''Silybum marianum''), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of amatoxins, preventing their uptake by [[hepatocyte]]s, thereby protecting undamaged hepatic tissue.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hruby K, Csomos G, Fuhrmann M, Thaler H |title=Chemotherapy of ''Amanita phalloides'' poisoning with intravenous silibinin |journal=Human Toxicology |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=183–95 |year=1983 |pmid=6862461 |doi=10.1177/096032718300200203|s2cid=19805371 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Carducci R|date=1996| title=Silibinin and acute poisoning with ''Amanita phalloides''|journal=Minerva Anestesiologica|volume=62 |issue=5 |pages=187–93|pmid=8937042|language=it|display-authors=etal}}</ref> In patients developing liver failure, a liver transplant is often the only option to prevent death.
