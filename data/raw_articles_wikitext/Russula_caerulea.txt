'''''Russula caerulea''''', commonly known as the '''humpback brittlegill''', is a member of the genus ''[[Russula]]'', whose members are also known as brittlegills. It is a dark [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] or purple-colored [[edible mushroom|edible]] mushroom, and grows with [[coniferous]] trees in late summer and autumn. It is found in Europe and North America.

==Taxonomy==
First [[species description|described]] by mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in his 1801 work ''Synopsis methodica fungorum'' as ''Agaricus caeruleus'', its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is the [[Latin]] ''caeruleus'' meaning "blue".<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| date = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref> It was transferred to the genus ''Russula'' in 1838 by the Swedish father of mycology [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. The 1927 name ''Russula amara'' by Kučera is a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]].<ref name="Species Fungorum synonymy"/>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|3|–|10|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter. It is dark purplish-brown, with a dark, sometimes almost black centre. At first it is convex, or even nearly bell-shaped, but later flattens. It nearly always retains a broad pointed boss (umbo) in the cap centre which is a profile that is almost unique within the [[genus]]. The cap skin peels to two-thirds, and it later has a furrowed margin. The firm, white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|4|–|9|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|1|–|2|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide and narrowly club-shaped. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are adnexed to almost free, and are pale ochre, giving a [[spore print]] of the same colour. They are quite closely spaced initially. The flesh is white and tastes mild, but the cap skin is bitter on the tongue.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book| author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page = 25}}</ref>

Spores are ellipsoid and ornamented.

===Similar species===
''Russula atropurpurea'' ([[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz|Krombh.]]) Britzelm is infrequent with conifers, preferring deciduous woods, and forests. Its cap is never [[umbonate]], but usually depressed.

''Russula viscida'' Kudrna has no umbo either, and is very rare. The cuticle of the cap hardly peels at all.<ref name=Phillips06/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Russula caerulea'' appears in late summer and autumn. It is widespread in the northern [[temperate]] zones, Europe, Asia, and North America. It is probably [[mycorrhizal]] with pine trees (''[[Pinus]]''), on sandy soils.

==Edibility==
This mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but has a bitter cap skin after chewing.<ref name=Phillips06/>
