== Description ==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is striate, bell-shaped at first, but becoming convex, or occasionally nearly flat with the margin turning up slightly. The cap has a sticky surface from which the [[Pileipellis|cuticle]] can be peeled<ref name="Gerhardt" /> and measures {{convert|1 to 2|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} wide, with a colour varying from yellowish brown to gray-brown.<ref name=":1" /> The margin is somewhat irregular, and the flesh white and fragile. The stipe is long and slender, about {{Cvt|4-9|cm|frac=8}} tall and 1–2&nbsp;mm wide;<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The gills are white to cream, sometimes tinged with pink when older; they are fairly widely spaced, adnate, or slightly decurrent. The spores are amyloidic and have a length of 8 to 10 [[micrometre]]s and a width of 4 to 5.5&nbsp;μm. The [[spore print]] is white to very pale buff.<ref name=FN/>

The [[mycelium]] is [[bioluminescent]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Perry, Brian |year=2007 |title=Bioluminescent fungi |url=http://www.mykoweb.com/articles/BioluminescentFungi.html |access-date=15 January 2021 |publisher=MycoWeb}}</ref>
