'''''Leratiomyces ceres''''',<ref name=bridge_etal/> commonly known as the '''chip cherry'''<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Siegel |first1=Noah |title=Mushrooms of the Redwood Coast |last2=Schwartz |first2=Christian |date=9 August 2016 |publisher=Clarkson Potter/Ten Speed |isbn=9781607748175}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=iNaturalist |url=https://www.inaturalist.org/ |access-date=2023-12-21 |website=iNaturalist |language=en}}</ref> or '''redlead roundhead''', is mushroom which has a bright red to orange cap and dark purple-brown [[spore deposit]]. The name '''''Stropharia aurantiaca''''' has been used extensively but incorrectly for this mushroom (together with a number of similar synonyms).

It is usually found growing gregariously on [[wood chips]] and is one of the most common and most distinctive mushrooms found in that habitat. It is common on wood chips and lawns in North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and elsewhere.

== Taxonomy ==
There has been some confusion between ''L.&nbsp;ceres'', which has a fairly thick white stem, and ''[[Leratiomyces squamosus|L. squamosus]]'' var. ''thaustus'', which has a slender stem and prominent scales below the ring zone (although the two taxa are quite easy to distinguish by sight).  Around 1885 [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] originated the names ''Agaricus squamosus'' f. ''aurantiacus'' and ''Agaricus thraustus'' var. ''aurantiacus'', and this later gave rise to the name ''Stropharia aurantiaca''.<ref name="SF1" />  This name is defined by [[:File:Illustrations_of_British_Fungi_(Hymenomycetes),_to_serve_as_an_atlas_to_the_%22Handbook_of_British_Fungi%22_(Pl._562)_(9015271675).jpg|Cooke's illustration to his ''Handbook of British Fungi'']] and in 2004 Richard Fortey discovered that this illustration was not of ''L.&nbsp;ceres'', as had generally been assumed,<ref name="Eyssartier" /> but it was ''L.&nbsp;squamosus'' var. ''thaustus''.<ref name="Fortey" />  Thus the name ''aurantiaca'' is best avoided, being wrong when applied to ''L.&nbsp;ceres''.

The name ''Agaricus ceres'' was created in 1888 by [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke|Cooke]] and [[George Edward Massee|Massee]] for the white-stemmed species, and was reclassified as ''Psilocybe ceres'' (in 1891) and ''Leratiomyces ceres'' (in 2008).<ref name="SF2" /><ref name="Eyssartier" />

== Description ==
''L. ceres'' may be described as follows.<ref name=Eyssartier/><ref name="FungaNordica"/>

* '''Cap''': 2 to 6&nbsp;cm in diameter,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=218–219|oclc=797915861}}</ref> with thin flesh and a bright red to orange top which is convex to plane in age. Has white [[partial veil]] remnants<ref name=":1">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=211}}</ref> when young. The cap surface is usually dry, but can be slightly viscid when moist.  
* '''Gills''': White to pale grey at first, later darker purple/brown or purplish grey<ref name=":0" /> with whitish edges. Attached (adnexed to adnate) and often notched.
* '''Stipe''': Whitish, often with dark orange stains in age (most evident around base), 3–6&nbsp;cm long and 0.5 to 1&nbsp;cm wide,<ref name=":0" /> equal to slightly larger at the base, which often has mycelium attached. The veil is thin and leaves a fragile, indistinct ring, sometimes missing with age.  The stalk is smooth above the ring zone and is fluffy with tiny scales below,<ref name="audu2">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=674}}</ref> which often wash off in rain. 
* '''Spores''': Dark purple/brown.<ref name=":0" /> 10–13.5 × 6–8.5 m. Elliptical and smooth.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Other microscopic features''': [[Chrysocystidia]] are present both on the edges and on the faces of the gills.

Similar species include ''L. squamosus'',<ref name=":1" /> ''[[Agrocybe putaminum]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus sapineus]]'', ''[[Psathyrella corrugis]]'',<ref name=":0" /> ''[[Stropharia squamosa]]'', ''S.&nbsp;thrausta'',<ref name=":1" /> and ''[[Tubaria furfuracea]]''.<ref name=":0" />

In [[psilocybin mushroom]] hunting communities in Australia and New Zealand, ''L.&nbsp;ceres'' (or "Larrys" as commonly nicknamed) are scorned as lookalikes and imposters of ''Psilocybe'' species on wood chip. Prolific growth in the same habitats and a similar appearance from afar can give false hope of a large bounty, but on closer inspection the species are not particularly alike.
