'''''Amanita flavoconia''''', commonly known as '''yellow patches''', '''yellow wart''', '''orange amanita''', '''yellow-dust amanita''' or the '''American yellow dust amanita''',<ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> is a species of [[mushroom]] in the family [[Amanitaceae]]. It has an orangish-yellow [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with yellowish-orange patches or warts, a yellowish-orange [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]], and a white to orange stem. Common and widespread throughout eastern North America, it grows on the ground in [[Temperate deciduous forest|broad-leaved]] and [[mixed forest]]s, especially in [[mycorrhiza]]l association with [[Tsuga|hemlock]].

==Taxonomy==


''Amanita flavoconia'' was first described by American naturalist [[George Francis Atkinson]] in 1902, based on a specimen he found in woods north of Fall Creek, [[Cayuga Lake]] Basin, New York State.<ref name="Atkinson1902" /> [[Jean-Edouard Gilbert]] placed it in ''Amplariella'', in 1941,<ref name="Gilbert1941" /> while in 1948 [[William Alphonso Murrill]] thought that it belonged best in ''Venenarius'';<ref name="urlMycoBank: Amanita flavoconia" /><ref name="Murrill1948" /> both of these [[segregate (taxonomy)|segregate genera]] have been folded back into ''Amanita''.<ref name="Kirk2008" />

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''flavoconia'' means ''yellowish'' and ''conical''.<ref name="Roody2003" /> Its [[common name]]s include "yellow patches",<ref name="Roody2003" /> "yellow wart",<ref name="McKnight1987" /> "orange Amanita",<ref name="Thomas1990" /> or "yellow-dust Amanita".<ref name="urlCornell Plant Pathology Herbarium" />

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially [[wikt:ovoid|ovoid]] in shape, but in maturity becomes convex and eventually flattened. Orange to bright yellow-orange in color, it reaches diameters of {{convert|3|to|9|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}}.<ref name="Roody2003" /> Young specimens are covered with [[chrome yellow]] warts that may be easily rubbed off or washed away with rain.

The cap surface is smooth and sticky (viscid) beneath the warts; the edge of the cap is [[wikt:striate|striate]], reflecting the arrangement of the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] underneath. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white. The gills are barely free from the stem, and packed close together. They are white or tinged yellow on the edges, and initially covered with a yellowish [[partial veil]]. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is typically {{convert|5.5 to 11.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} long by {{convert|0.7 to 1.4|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick,<ref name=Jenkins1986/> equal or slightly tapered upward from a small rounded bulb at the base. Its color may range from white to yellowish orange, and the surface may be smooth, or covered with small flakes. The base of the stem usually has chrome yellow flakes of [[universal veil]] material adhering loosely to the bulb, or in the soil around the base. The partial veil leaves a skirt-like ring, ([[annulus (mycology)|annulus]]) on the upper stem. The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name=Roody2003/>

Campbell and Petersen published a detailed description of the characteristics of ''A.&nbsp;flavoconia'' grown in culture. In the era prior to the commonplace use of DNA analysis and [[phylogenetics]], cultural characters were often used to help provide additional [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] information; they found considerable variability between different isolates.<ref name=Campbell1975/>

Two variants have been reported from [[Colombia]], collected from ''[[Quercus humboldtii]]'' forests: ''A.&nbsp;flavoconia'' var. ''sinapicolor'' and var. ''inquinata''.<ref name=Tulloss1992/>

===Microscopic features===
The [[basidiospores|spores]] are elliptical, smooth, and have dimensions of 7–9 by 5–8&nbsp;[[μm]]. They are [[hyaline]] (translucent), and [[amyloid]], meaning that they absorb the iodine stain in [[Melzer's reagent]].<ref name=Roody2003/> The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are up to 35–43&nbsp;μm long by 4–12&nbsp;μm, and each have four [[sterigmata]], extensions that hold the spores.<ref name=Jenkins1982/> The outer layer, or cuticle of the cap (known technically as the [[pileipellis]]) is made of filamentous interwoven gelatinized [[hypha]]e, with diameters between 3 and 7&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Jenkins1986/>

===Similar species===
This species has often been confused with ''[[Amanita muscaria|A.&nbsp;muscaria]]'', some subspecies of which are also orange-colored.<ref name="urlCornell Plant Pathology Herbarium" /> It also bears some resemblance to ''[[Amanita frostiana|A.&nbsp;frostiana]]'' and ''[[Amanita favorubescens|A.&nbsp;flavorubescens]]''. One 1982 study concluded that a "large majority" of [[herbarium]] specimens labeled as ''A.&nbsp;frostiana'' were actually ''A.&nbsp;flavoconia''. The use of [[Microscopy|microscopic]] features is necessary to distinguish clearly among the species: ''A.&nbsp;flavoconia'' has elliptic, amyloid spores, while ''A.&nbsp;frostiana'' has round, non-amyloid spores; ''A.&nbsp;muscaria'' has nonamyloid, elliptic spores. In the field, ''A.&nbsp;flavorubescens'' can usually be distinguished by its yellow cap color.<ref name="Jenkins1986" />

==Distribution and habitat==

A common [[mycorrhiza]]l mushroom, ''A. flavoconia'' grows solitarily or in groups on the ground in the summer to the fall, in broad-leaved and mixed woods. Noted for preferring [[Tsuga|hemlock]], it is also associated with high elevation [[red spruce]] forests.<ref name="Roody2003" />

In North America, ''A. flavoconia'' has a wide distribution and has been collected from several locations, including Ontario, Canada;<ref name="Petersen1963" /> the United States<ref name="Jenkins1986" /> (Iowa),<ref name="Martin1926" /> and Mexico.<ref name="Aroche1984" /><ref name="Ayala1988" /> It has been described as "of the most common and widespread species of ''Amanita'' in eastern North America."<ref name="urlAmanita flavoconia G. F. Atk. var. flavoconia" />

==Edibility==
As the edibility of this species is unknown, it should not be consumed,<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |publisher=Firefly Books |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |location=Buffalo, NY |page=31}}</ref> and a number of its relatives are quite poisonous.
