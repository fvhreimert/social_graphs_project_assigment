'''''Hydnellum gracilipes''''' is a species of [[Hydnoid fungi|tooth fungus]] in the family [[Bankeraceae]].  [[Basidiocarp|Fruit bodies]] of the fungus have a pinkish to reddish-brown colour, a delicate texture described as "felty or papery", and flimsy [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]].  ''H.&nbsp;gracilipes'' is found in northern Europe, where it is [[mycorrhiza]]l with [[pine]]. 

==Taxonomy==

The fungus was first [[species description|described]] scientifically in 1886 by the Finnish mycologist [[Petter Karsten]], who called it ''Hydnum gracilipes''. He transferred it to the genus ''[[Hydnellum]]'' in 1879.<ref name="Karsten 1879"/>

==Description==

''Hydnellum gracilipes'' forms small, stalked fruit bodies ([[basidiocarp]]s) with caps ([[pileus (mycology)|pilei]]) up to 3&nbsp;mm across. Young caps are clothed in fine hairs (tomentose), giving them a velvety feel; as they mature these hairs wear off and the surface becomes dull and smooth (glabrous). The overall tone is a pale purplish‑brown, tending toward a more yellowish shade at the centre. On the underside, short downward‑pointing spines reach up to 2&nbsp;mm in length; these are initially pale purplish‑brown and deepen slightly in colour as they age. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] (context) is very thin—around 1.5&nbsp;mm thick—and shows a faint two‑layered (duplex) appearance, becoming a gentle purplish‑brown at maturity.<ref name="Ryvarden 2024"/>

The stem ([[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]) measures up to 1.5&nbsp;cm in height and about 4&nbsp;mm in thickness. Like the cap, it begins with a fine, hairy covering and later smooths out, retaining the same colour as the pileus. Under the microscope, the hyphae (filamentous cells) are simple septate—meaning each cell is divided by cross‑walls—and range from 2 to 6&nbsp;[[μm]] in width. The spores produced on the spines are small (4.3–4.6 by 2.7–3.6&nbsp;[[μm]]), pale in colour, and ornamented with tiny surface projections, which help in species identification.<ref name="Ryvarden 2024"/> They are roughly spherical with a diameter of no more than 5&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Ainsworth 2011"/>

==Habitat and distribution==

''Hydnellum gracilipes'' is widely distributed in northern Europe, where it forms [[ectomycorrhiza]]e with [[conifer]]s.<ref name="Kõljalg 2000"/> In Norway, the northern extent of its distribution is in [[Finnmark]].<ref name="Ryvarden 2024"/> Collections made in Scotland have been found by lifting the dense ground cover of common heather (''[[Calluna vulgaris]]''), which the fungus seems to use to as support to compensate for its flimsy stipe.<ref name="Ainsworth 2011"/>
