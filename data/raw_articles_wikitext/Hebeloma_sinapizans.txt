It has a strong [[radish]]-like smell and a prominent bulbous [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] base. ''H.&nbsp;sinapizans'' is found in Europe and North America and is [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].

==Taxonomy==
First described as ''Hypophyllum sinapizans'' by [[Jean-Jacques Paulet]] in 1793,<ref name="Paulet 1793"/> it was transferred to the genus ''[[Hebeloma]]'' by [[Claude Casimir Gillet]] in 1878.<ref name="Gillet 1878"/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "rough-stalked Hebeloma".<ref name="Bessette 2007"/>

==Description==
The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] has a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is initially convex before flattening out in age, reaching a diameter of {{convert|4-16|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}}.<ref name="Arora1986" /> The cap may have a shallow [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. The cap surface is smooth, moist to sticky, and first with an inrolled margin then becoming uplifted. It is tannish, sometimes with pinkish grayish tints.<ref name="Arora1986" /> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an [[adnation|adnate]] attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and have a notch just before the point of attachment; the gill edges have tiny fringes or serrations.<ref name="Arora1986" /> They are first whitish before turning pale brown in maturity.<ref name="Arora1986" /> The [[spore print]] is pale brown.<ref name="Arora1986" /> 

The stipe measures {{convert|2-13|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} long and {{convert|1-3|cm|4=cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} thick; it is roughly equal in width except for a swollen base.<ref name="Arora1986" /><ref name="Bessette 2007" /> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, thick, and has a radish-like odor<ref name="Arora1986" /> and taste. The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are elliptical with a rough surface texture and measure 10–14 by 6–8&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Bessette 2007" />

=== Similar species ===
It is similar to the more common ''[[Hebeloma crustuliniforme|H.&nbsp;crustuliniforme]]'', a smaller relative<ref name="Arora1986" /> that is also [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]].

==Distribution and habitat==
As of December 2022, the species has been found in 20 countries across Europe as well as in Asiatic Turkey and Lebanon.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hebeloma sinapizans |url=https://hebeloma.org/species/sinapizans |access-date=2022-12-28}}</ref>
