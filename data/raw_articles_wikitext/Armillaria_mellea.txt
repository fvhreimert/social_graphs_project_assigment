'''''Armillaria mellea''''', commonly known as '''honey fungus''', is an edible [[basidiomycete]] fungus in the genus ''[[Armillaria]]''. It is a [[plant pathogen]] and part of a [[cryptic species complex]] of closely related and [[Morphology (biology)|morphologically]] similar species. It causes [[Armillaria root rot]] in many plant species and produces mushrooms around the base of trees it has infected. The symptoms of infection appear in the crowns of infected trees as discoloured foliage, reduced growth, [[Forest dieback|dieback]] of the branches and death. The [[mycelium]] is capable of producing light via [[bioluminescence]].

The mushroom is widely distributed in [[temperate]] regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It typically grows on hardwoods but may be found around and on other living and dead wood or in open areas.

==Taxonomy==
The species was originally named ''Agaricus melleus'' by Danish-Norwegian botanist [[Martin Vahl]] in 1790; it was transferred to the genus ''[[Armillaria]]'' in 1871 by [[Paul Kummer]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Armillaria mellea"/> Numerous [[Taxon|subtaxa]] have been described:

==Description==
's ''Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms'']]
]]
The [[basidiocarp]] of each has a smooth cap {{convert|3|to|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter,<ref name=":5" /> convex at first but becoming flattened with age often with a central raised umbo, later becoming somewhat dish-shaped. The margins of the cap are often arched at maturity and the surface is sticky when wet. Though typically honey-coloured, this fungus is rather variable in appearance and sometimes has a few dark, hairy scales near the centre somewhat radially arranged. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white at first, sometimes becoming pinkish-yellow or discoloured with age, broad and fairly distant, attached to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] at right angles or are slightly [[decurrent]]. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap is whitish and has a sweetish odour and flavour with a tinge of bitterness.

The stipe is of variable length, up to about {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3.5|cm|in|frac=4|abbr=on}} in diameter. It is fibrillose and of a firm spongy consistency at first but later becomes hollow. It is cylindrical and tapers to a point at its base where it is fused to the stipes of other mushrooms in the clump. It is whitish at the upper end and brownish-yellow below, often with a very dark-coloured base. There is a broad persistent skin-like [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] attached to the upper part of the stipe. This has a velvety margin and yellowish fluff underneath and extends outwards as a white [[partial veil]] protecting the gills when young.

Under the microscope, the [[spore]]s are approximately elliptical, 7–9 by 6–7&nbsp;[[μm]], [[inamyloid]] with prominent apiculi (short, pointed projections) at the base. The [[spore print]] is white. The [[basidia]] (spore-producing structures) lack basal clamps.<ref>{{cite book |title=Mushrooms and Toadstools in Colour |last1=Hvass |first1=Else |last2=Hvass |first2=Hans |year=1961 |publisher=Blandford Press |isbn=9780713701463 |page=110 }}</ref><ref name="Kuo">{{cite web |url=https://www.mushroomexpert.com/armillaria_mellea.html |title=''Armillaria mellea'': The Honey Mushroom |author=Kuo, Michael |date=2004-10-01 |work=MushroomExpert.Com |access-date=2013-10-18}}</ref>

The main part of the fungus is underground where a mat of [[mycelial]] threads may extend for great distances. They are bundled together in [[rhizomorph]]s that are black in this species.<ref name="Kuo" /> The fungal body is not [[bioluminescent]] but its mycelia are luminous when in active growth.<ref name="Desjardin 2008" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
''Armillaria mellea'' is widespread in northern [[temperate]] zones. It has been found throughout North America,<ref name="audu" /> and in Europe and northern Asia. It has been [[introduced species|introduced]] to South Africa. It grows [[parasitically]] on a large number of broadleaf trees.

There are few signs, and they are often difficult to observe. The most prominent sign is honey-coloured mushrooms at the base of the infected plant.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Armillaria Root Disease|url=https://hort.extension.wisc.edu/articles/armillaria-root-disease/|access-date=2020-12-10|website=Wisconsin Horticulture}}</ref> Additional signs include white, fan-shaped mycelia and black rhizomorphs with diameters between {{Convert|1/32 and 1/8|in|4=1}}.<ref name=":1" /> These usually are not as noticeable because they occur beneath the bark and in the soil, respectively.<ref name=":1" /> The symptoms are much more numerous, including slower growth, dieback of branches, yellowing foliage,<ref name=":2" /> rotted wood at base and/or roots, external cankers, cracking bark, bleeding stem, leaf wilting, defoliation, and rapid death.<ref name=":1" /> Leaf wilting, defoliation, and dieback occur after the destruction of the cambium.<ref name=":1" />

It is one of the most common causes of death in trees and shrubs in both natural and cultivated habitats, and cause steady and substantial losses.

Trees become infected when rhizomorphs growing through the soil encounter uninfected roots. Alternatively, when infected roots come into contact with uninfected ones the fungal mycelium may grow across. The rhizomorphs invade the trunk, growing between the bark and the wood and causing wood decay, growth reduction and mortality. Trees that are already under stress are more likely to be attacked but healthy trees may also be parasitized. The foliage becomes sparse and discoloured, twig growth slows down and branches may die back. When they are attacked, the [[Douglas-fir]], [[western larch]] and some other conifers often produce an extra large crop of cones shortly before dying. Coniferous trees also tend to ooze resin from infected areas whereas broad-leaved trees sometimes develop sunken [[canker]]s. A growth of fruiting bodies near the base of the trunk confirms the suspicion of Armillaria root rot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.na.fs.fed.us/spfo/pubs/fidls/armillaria/armillaria.htm |title=Armillaria Root Disease |author1=Williams, RE |author2=Shaw, CG |author3=Wargo, PM |author4=Sites, WH |date=1989-04-01 |work=Forest Insect & Disease Leaflet 78 |publisher=US Department of Agriculture Forest Service |access-date=2013-10-17}}</ref>

In 1893, the American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] reported finding ''Armillaria'' fruiting bodies that were "aborted", in a similar way to specimens of ''[[Entoloma abortivum]]''. It was not until 1974 that [[Roy Watling]] showed that the aborted specimens included cells of both ''Armillaria mellea'' and ''Entoloma abortivum''. He thought that the ''Armillaria'' was parasitizing the ''Entoloma'', a plausible hypothesis given its [[pathogen]]ic behaviour.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mushroomexpert.com/entoloma_abortivum.html |title=''Entoloma abortivum'' |author=Kuo, Michael |date=2004-10-01 |work=MushroomExpert.Com  |access-date=2013-10-19}}</ref> However, a 2001 study by Czederpiltz, Volk and Burdsall showed that the ''Entoloma'' was in fact the microparasite. The whitish-grey malformed fruit bodies known as carpophoroids were the result of ''E.&nbsp;abortivum'' [[hypha]]e penetrating the ''Armillaria'' and disrupting its normal development.<ref name="Czederpiltz 2001"/>

The main part of the fungus is underground where a mat of mycelial threads may extend for great distances. The rhizomorphs of are initiated from mycelium into multicellular apices of rhizomorphs, which are multicellular vegetative organs that exclude soil from the interior of the rhizomorph tissues. The rhizomorphs spread through far greater distances through the ground than the mycelium. The rhizomorphs are black in this species.<ref name=Kuo/> The fungal body is not [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] but its mycelia and rhizomorphs are luminous when in active growth.<ref name="Desjardin 2008"/> ''A.&nbsp;mellea'' producing rhizomorphs is parasitic on woody plants of many species, including especially shrubs, hardwood and evergreen trees. In one example, ''A.&nbsp;mellea'' spread by rhizomorphs from an initially infected tree killed 600 trees in a prune orchard in 6 years. Each infected tree was immediately adjacent to an already infected one, the spread by rhizomorphs through the tree roots and soil.<ref>(Piper and Fletcher, 1903, Wash. Age. Exp. Sat. But., 59: 1–14); cited in Rhizomorph Development in A. mellea, Ph.D. thesis, by Philip Snider(1957), Farlow Herbarium Library Harvard Univ., 20 Divinity Ave., Cambridge, Mass.</ref>

=== Management ===
There are fungicides or management practices that will kill ''A.&nbsp;mellea'' after infection without damaging the infected plant, but these practicies are still being studied.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Aguín |first1=Olga |last2=Mansilla |first2=J Pedro |last3=Sainz |first3=María J |date=March 2006 |title=In vitro selection of an effective fungicide against Armillaria mellea and control of white root rot of grapevine in the field |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ps.1149 |journal=Pest Management Science |language=en |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=223–228 |doi=10.1002/ps.1149 |pmid=16475239 |issn=1526-498X|url-access=subscription }}</ref> There are practices that can extend the life of the plant and prevent further spreading. The best way to extend the plant life is to improve the host condition through supplemental watering and fertilization.<ref name=":2" /> To prevent further spread, it is recommended to regulate irrigation to avoid water stress, keep the root collar dry, control defoliating pathogens, remove stumps, fertilize adequately, avoid physical root damage and soil compaction, and to not plant trees that are especially susceptible to the disease in places where ''A.&nbsp;mellea'' has been recorded.<ref name=":1" /> There is also some evidence that biological control using the fungus genus ''[[Trichoderma]]'' may help. ''Trichoderma'' is a predator of ''A.&nbsp;mellea'' and is often found in woodchips.<ref name=":1" /> Therefore, chipping or grinding dead and infected roots will give ''Trichoderma'' its preferred habitat and help it proliferate. Solarization will also create an ideal habitat as dry soil and higher soil temperatures are preferable for ''Trichoderma'' but poor conditions for ''A.&nbsp;mellea.''<ref name=":1" />

==Edibility==

== Cultivation ==
Cultivation of ''A. mellea'' started with cultivation of its mycellia, which is used to support the cultivation of ''[[Gastrodia elata]]'', a non-photosynthetic plant used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]]. This kind of cultivation has been present since 1994 and uses pieces of wood inoculated with the fungus.<ref>{{cite web |title=天麻栽培方法 |url=https://patents.google.com/patent/CN1059306C/zh |website=Google Patent |language=zh |date=January 20, 1994 |trans-title=Method for cultivating Gastrodia elata}}</ref> In 2017, farmers from [[Heilongjiang]] succeeded in producing fruiting bodies (mushrooms) through cultivation.<ref>{{cite web |author1=哈尔滨新闻 网 [Harbin News Web] |title=我省菇农首次种植榛蘑成功 |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/148713848_349336 |website=www.sohu.com |date=2017-06-14|trans-title=Mushroom farmer from our province report success in planting Zhen-mo mushrooms|language=zh}}</ref> By 2019, the spent myceliated wood from ''Gastrodia'' cultivation is routinely used to seed new wood for mushroom production.<ref>{{cite web |author1=吉林乡村广播 [Jilin Countryside Radio] |trans-title=How to plant Zhen-mo artificially?

==Chemistry==
Several bioactive compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies. The [[triterpene]]s 3β-hydroxyglutin-5-ene,  friedelane-2α,3β-diol, and [[friedelin]] were reported in 2011.<ref name="Guo 2011"/> [[Indole]] compounds include [[tryptamine]], {{Nowrap|L-[[tryptophan]]}} and [[serotonin]].<ref name="Muszynska 2011"/>

The fungus produces [[cytotoxic]] compounds known as melleolides. Melleolides are made from orsellinic acid and protoilludane sesquiterpene alcohols via esterification. A polyketide synthase gene, termed ''ArmB'', was identified in the genome of the fungus, which was found expressed during melleolide production. The gene shares c. 42% similarity with the orsellinic acid synthase gene (''OrsA'') in ''Aspergillus nidulans''. Characterization of the gene proved it to catalyze orsillinic acid in vitro. It is a non-reducing iterative type-1 polyketide synthase. Co-incubation of free orsellinic acid with alcohols and ArmB showed cross-coupling activity. Therefore, the enzyme has transesterification activity. Also, there are other auxiliary factors suspected to control substrate specificity.<ref>Lackner et al., 2013</ref> Additionally, halogen modifications have been observed. Overexpression of annotated halogenases (termed ''ArmH1-5'') and characterization of the subsequent enzymes revealed in all five enzymes the chlorination of mellolide&nbsp;F.
