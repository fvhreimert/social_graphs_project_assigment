It has a broadly convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] covered in small dry reddish-brown scales, a stout yellow [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] beneath reddish brown, wine-red to purple vertical fibres, and a thick rusty orange [[spore print]]. {{cn|date=May 2023}}

The fruitbodies can stain greenish, blue and purple when damaged, and the species is [[psychoactive]]. A [http://www.tacethno.com/info/psilocybe/gartz1.txt chemical analysis] carried out by [[Jochen Gartz]] in 1993 found that this species contains 0.34% [[psilocybin]], 0.29% [[psilocin]] and 0.05% [[baeocystin]]. {{cn|date=May 2023}}

The cap ranges from 1.5 to 6&nbsp;cm across, is convex to obtuse, and is reddish brown with a dry scaly surface which is sometimes cracked in age.
