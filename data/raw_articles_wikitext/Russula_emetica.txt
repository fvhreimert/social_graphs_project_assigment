'''''Russula emetica''''',  commonly known as '''the sickener''', '''emetic russula''', or '''vomiting russula''', is a [[basidiomycete]] mushroom, and the [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Russula]]''. It was first described in 1774.

It has a red, convex to flat [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|8.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, with a [[cap cuticle|cuticle]] that can be peeled off almost  to the centre. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white to pale cream, and closely spaced. A smooth white [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures up to {{convert|10.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|2.4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. There are many similar russulas with a red cap and white stem and gills, some of which can be reliably distinguished only by microscopy. The mushroom has a wide distribution in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], where it grows on the ground in damp woodlands in a [[mycorrhiza]]l association with [[conifer]]s, especially [[pine]].

The mushroom's [[common name]]s refer to the gastrointestinal distress which it causes when consumed raw. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its [[poisonous mushroom|toxicity]], can be removed by [[parboiling]] or [[pickling]]. Although it used to be widely eaten in Russia and eastern European countries, it is generally not recommended for consumption.

==Taxonomy==
''Russula emetica'' was first officially [[species description|described]] as ''Agaricus emeticus'' by [[Jacob Christian Schäffer|Jacob Christian Schaeffer]] in 1774, in his series on fungi of [[Bavaria]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], ''Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur icones.''<ref name="Schaeffer 1774"/> [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] placed it in its current genus ''Russula'' in 1796,<ref name="Persoon 1796"/> where it remains. According to the nomenclatural database [[MycoBank]], ''Agaricus russula'' is a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''R.&nbsp;emetica'' that was published by [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] in 1772, two years earlier than Schaeffer's description. However, this name is unavailable as Persoon's name is [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Agaricus russula"/> Additional synonyms include [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]'s ''Amanita rubra'' (1783), and [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]]'s subsequent [[Combinatio nova|new combination]] ''Agaricus ruber'' (1805).<ref name="urlMycoBank: Russula emetica"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]]
''emetikos''/εμετικος 'emetic' or 'vomit-inducing'.<ref name="Liddell 1980"/> Similarly, its [[common name]]s of ''sickener'', ''emetic russula'',<ref name="urlRecommended"/> and ''vomiting russula'' also refer to this attribute.<ref name="urlFOTM"/>

''Russula emetica'' is the [[type species]] of the genus ''Russula''.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Russula"/> According to [[Rolf Singer]]'s infrageneric [[classification (biology)|classification]] of ''Russula'', it is also the type of the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Russula''.<ref name="Singer 1986"/><ref name="urlRussulales"/> In an alternative classification proposed by [[Henri Romagnesi]], it is the type species of subsection ''Emeticinae''.<ref name="Romagnesi 1987"/> A [[molecular phylogenetic|molecular]] analysis of European ''Russula'' species determined that ''R.&nbsp;emetica'' groups in a [[clade]] with ''[[Russula raoultii|R.&nbsp;raoultii]]'', ''[[Russula betularum|R.&nbsp;betularum]]'', and ''[[Russula nana|R.&nbsp;nana]]'';<ref name="Miller 2002"/> a later analysis confirmed the close [[phylogenetic]] relationship between ''R.&nbsp;emetica'' and the latter two Russulas.<ref name="Das 2006"/>

The sticky [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''R.&nbsp;emetica'' is {{convert|2.5–10|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, with a shape ranging from convex (in young specimens) to flattened, sometimes with a central depression,<ref name="Arora 1986" /> and sometimes with a shallow [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. It is a bright scarlet or cherry red, and in maturity, the margins have fine radial grooves extending {{convert|2–7|mm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} towards the center of the cap. The [[pileipellis|cuticle]] can be readily peeled from the cap almost to the centre. The brittle [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white (or tinged with red directly under the cap cuticle), measures {{convert|4–9|mm|1|abbr=on}} thick, and has a very sharp and peppery taste. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are closely spaced, white to creamy-white, and [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] to [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] or completely free. They are intervenose (containing cross-veins in the spaces between the gills) and occasionally forked near the cap margin.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/>

The white [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures {{convert|4.5–10.5|cm|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.7–2.4|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick, and is roughly the same width throughout its length, although it can be a bit thicker near the base. Its surface is dry and smooth, sometimes marked by faint longitudinal grooves. It is either stuffed (filled with a cottony pith) or partially hollow, and lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] or [[partial veil]]. The fruit bodies have a slightly fruity or spicy smell.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/>

''Russula emetica'' produces a white to yellowish-white [[spore print]]. The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are roughly elliptical to egg-shaped, with a strongly warted and partially reticulate (web-like) surface. They have dimensions of 8.8–11.0 by 6.6–8&nbsp;[[μm]], and are [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], meaning that they will [[staining|stain]] blue, bluish-grey, to blackish in [[Melzer's reagent]]. [[Basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and measure 32.9–50 by 9.0–11.6&nbsp;μm. [[Cystidia]] located on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are somewhat cylindrical to club-shaped or somewhat spindle-shaped, and measure 35–88 by 7.3–12.4&nbsp;μm. They are yellowish, and contain [[granule (cell biology)|granular]] contents. Cheilocystidia (found on the edges of the gills), which are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, are thin-walled, hyaline, and measure 14–24 by 4.4–7.3&nbsp;μm. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent from the [[hypha]]e.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/>

The red [[pigment]]s of this and other russulas are water-soluble to some degree, and fruit bodies will often bleach or fade with rain or sunlight;<ref name="Ramsbottom 1953"/> the cap colour of older specimens may fade to pink or orange, or develop white blotches.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> The main pigment responsible for the red colour of the fruit bodies is called ''russularhodin'', but little is known of its chemical composition.<ref name="Watson 1966"/>

==Distribution and habitat==

Like all species of ''Russula'', ''R.&nbsp;emetica'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l, and forms [[mutualism (biology)|mutually beneficial]] partnerships with roots of trees and certain herbaceous plants. Preferred [[host (biology)|host]] plants are [[conifer]]s, especially [[pine]]s.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> Fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups in [[sphagnum moss]] near bogs, and in coniferous and [[mixed forest]]s. The fungus occasionally fruits on [[humus]] or on very rotten wood.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/> The mushroom is known from North Africa, Asia and Europe and can be locally very common.<ref name="Kränzlin 1991"/> There is some doubt over the extent of its range in North America, as some sightings refer to the related ''[[Russula silvicola|R.&nbsp;silvicola]]''; initially the name "Russula emetica" was often applied to any red-capped white ''Russula''.<ref name="Ammirati 1985"/> Sightings in Australia are now referred to the similarly coloured ''[[Russula persanguinea|R.&nbsp;persanguinea]]''.<ref name="Bougher 1998"/>

A multi-year field study of the growth of ''R.&nbsp;emetica'' production in a [[scots pine]] plantation in Scotland found that total productivity was 0.24–0.49 million mushrooms per hectare per year (roughly 0.1–0.2 million mushrooms/acre/year), corresponding to a fresh weight of 265–460&nbsp;kg per hectare per year (49–85 lb/acre/year). Productivity was highest from August to October. The longevity of the mushrooms was estimated to be 4–7 days.<ref name="Richardson 1970"/> In a study of the fungal [[biodiversity|diversity]] of ectomycorrhizal species in a [[Sitka spruce]] forest, ''R.&nbsp;emetica'' was one of the top five dominant fungi. Comparing the frequency of fruit body production between 10-, 20-, 30-, or 40-year-old forest stands, ''R.&nbsp;emetica'' was most prolific in the latter.<ref name="Palfner 2005"/>

==Ecology==

Both the [[red squirrel]] (''Sciurus vulgaris'') and the [[American red squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus hudsonicus'') are known to [[foraging|forage]] for, store and eat ''R.&nbsp;emetica''.<ref name="Lurz 1998" /><ref name="Camazine 1984" /> Other creatures that have been documented consuming the mushroom include the snail ''[[Mesodon thyroidus]]'',<ref name="Wolf 1939" /> several species of [[slug]]s (including ''[[Arion ater]]'', ''[[Arion subfuscus|A.&nbsp;subfuscus]]'', ''[[Arion intermedius|A.&nbsp;intermedius]]'',  ''[[Limax maximus]]'', ''[[Limax cinereoniger|L.&nbsp;cinereoniger]]'', and ''[[Deroceras reticulatum]]''),<ref name="Elliot 1922" /> the fruit flies ''[[Drosophila falleni]]'' and ''[[Drosophila quinaria|D.&nbsp;quinaria]]'',<ref name="Jaenike 1977" /> and the [[fungus gnat]] ''[[Allodia bipexa]]''.<ref name="Sasakawa 2003" />

== Toxicity ==
As its name implies, the sickener is inedible, though not as dangerous as sometimes described in older mushroom guides.<ref name="Rubel 2008" />  The symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: [[nausea]], [[diarrhoea]], vomiting, and [[colic]]ky abdominal cramps. These symptoms typically begin half an hour to three hours after ingestion of the mushroom,<ref name="Edwards 1989" /> and usually subside spontaneously, or shortly after the ingested material has been expelled from the [[human gastrointestinal tract|intestinal tract]].<ref name="Ammirati 1985" /> The active agents have not been identified but are thought to be [[sesquiterpene]]s, which have been isolated from the related genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'' and from ''[[Russula sardonia]]''.<ref name="Benjamin 1995" /> Sesquiterpenoids that have been identified from ''R.&nbsp;emetica'' include the previously known compounds lactarorufin&nbsp;A, furandiol, methoxyfuranalcohol, and an unnamed compound unique to this species.<ref name="Kobata 1995" />

==Uses==
The bitter taste disappears on cooking and it is said to then be [[edible mushroom|edible]], though consumption is not recommended.<ref name="Zeitlmayr l976" /> The mushroom used to be widely eaten in eastern European countries and Russia after [[parboiling]] (which removes the toxins), and then salting or [[pickling]].<ref name="Roberts 2011" /> In some regions of Hungary and Slovakia, the cap cuticle is removed and used as a spice for [[goulash]].<ref name="Rogers 2006" />
