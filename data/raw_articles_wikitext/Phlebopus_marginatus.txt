'''''Phlebopus marginatus''''', commonly known as the '''salmon gum mushroom''' in [[Western Australia]], is a member of the [[Boletales]] or pored [[fungi]]. An imposing sight in forests of south-eastern and south-western Australia, it is possibly Australia's largest terrestrial [[mushroom]], with the weight of one specimen from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] recorded at {{convert|29|kg|abbr=on}}. Initially [[species description|described]] in 1845 as ''Boletus marginatus'', and also previously known by scientific names such as ''Phaeogyroporus portentosus'' and ''Boletus portentosus'', it is not as closely related to [[Boletaceae|typical boletes]] as previously thought.

==Taxonomy==
English naturalist [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] initially [[species description|described]] ''Boletus marginatus'' in 1845, from the writings and specimens of [[James Drummond (botanist)|James Drummond]], from the vicinity of the [[Swan River Colony]] in Western Australia.<ref name="Berkeley 1845"/> Berkeley and Broome described ''Boletus portentosus'' in a report published in 1873 of the fungi of Ceylon, from a specimen with a 25&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) diameter cap collected on June 15, 1869. They held it to be related to ''[[Boletus aestivalis]]''.<ref name="Berkbroome 1873"/> Microscopic differences led to it being reclassified; Boedijn noted the shape of its spores, lack of cystidia and short tubes and allocated it to the genus ''[[Phlebopus]]'' in 1951.<ref name="Boedijn 1951"/> New Zealand botanist Robert McNabb followed [[Rolf Singer]] who had determined ''Phlebopus'' was a [[nomen dubium]] (though conceding Singer was likely in error), and coined the binomial ''Phaeogyroporus portentosus'',<ref name="McNabb 1968"/> by which it was known for some years. In his 1982 review of the genus, mycologist [[Paul Heinemann]] used this latter designation.<ref name=Heinemann1982/> The [[genus|generic]] name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Φλεψ/Φλεβο- "vein",{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1980|p=763}} and πους "foot".{{sfn|Liddell|Scott|1980|p=580}}

Considering the two taxa to be the same,<ref name=watling99/> mycologist [[Roy Watling]] proposed the name ''Phlebopus marginatus'' over ''P. portentosus'' in 2001, pointing out that the former name predated the latter.<ref name="Watling 1988"/> He noted specimens across its range conform to the species description, although queried whether a single species occurs over so wide a range.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watling|first=Roy|year=2001|title=The relationships and possible distributional patterns of boletes in south-east Asia|journal=Mycological Research|volume=105|issue=12|pages=1440–48|doi=10.1017/S0953756201004877}}</ref>

It is not as closely related to [[Boletaceae|typical boletes]] as was previously thought. The genus ''Phlebopus'' is a member of the [[suborder]] ''[[Sclerodermatineae]]'', which makes it more closely related to [[Scleroderma (fungus)|earth balls]] than to typical boletes. Within this suborder, ''Phlebopus'' makes up the family Boletinellaceae with ''[[Boletinellus]]''.<ref name="Watling 1988"/><ref name="Wilson 2012"/> ''Boletus brevitubus'', described from ''[[Cephalocitrus grandis]]'' and ''[[Delonix regia]]'' forests of [[Yunnan, China]] in 1991,<ref name="Zang 1991"/> was placed into [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymy]] with ''Phlebopus marginatus'' in 2009.<ref name="Lei 2009"/>

A common name in Western Australia is salmon gum mushroom.<ref name="Griffiths 1985"/> Common names in Asia include ''hed har'' and ''hed tub tao dum'' in Thailand, or tropical black bolete.<ref name=mortimer>{{cite journal|author1=Mortimer, Peter |author2=Karunarathna, Samantha C. |author3=Li, Qiaohong |author4=Gui, Heng |author5=Yang, Xueqing |author6=Yang, Xuefei |author7=He, Jun |author8=Ye, Lei |author9=Guo, Jiayu |author10=Li, Huili |author11=Sysouphanthong, Phongeun |author12=Zhou, Dequn |author13=Xu, Jianchu |author14=Hyde, Kevin D. |year=2012|title=Prized edible Asian mushrooms: ecology, conservation and sustainability|journal=Fungal Diversity|volume=56|issue=1|pages= 31–47|doi=10.1007/s13225-012-0196-3|s2cid=16754587 }}</ref>

==Description==
, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] - January 1992]]
Possibly Australia's largest terrestrial [[mushroom]], ''Phlebopus marginatus'' produces [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] that can reach huge proportions.<ref name="Fuhrer 2005"/> The weight of one specimen from western [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] recorded at 29&nbsp;kg (64&nbsp;pounds).<ref name="Fuhrer 2005"/> [[John Burton Cleland]] reported finding specimens with a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] diameter of {{convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}}, weighing over {{convert|70|lb|kg}}, but reports about specimens with caps over {{convert|100|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter also exist.<ref name="McNabb 1968"/> The cap is convex to flat, occasionally with a depressed centre. It is brown to olive and covered in fine hair.<ref name="Cleland l976"/> Records between countries vary as to the colour change on cutting or bruising of flesh,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Watling|first=Roy|year=2006|title=The sclerodermatoid fungi|journal=Mycoscience|volume=47|issue=1|pages=18–24|doi=10.1007/s10267-005-0267-3|s2cid=84649900|doi-access=free}}</ref> with those of Western Australia indicating no change,<ref name="Griffiths 1985"/> while New Zealand and Indonesian collections are reported to have some bluish discoloration on bruising at the top of the stem.<ref name="Boedijn 1951"/><ref name="McNabb 1968"/> The spores are yellow-brown. Mature specimens are very attractive to insects and often infested with them.<ref name="Fuhrer 2005"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
]]
''Phlebopus marginatus'' is an example of a [[Gondwana]]n fungus, being found in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Sri Lanka]] as well as [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]],<ref name="Watling 2001"/> with related species found in [[South America]]. In fact, it is a pantropical species.

Within Australia it has been recorded from the southeast of South Australia to New South Wales.<ref name="Cleland l976"/> Within Australia it occurs in [[eucalypt]] forests and may be found any time after rain.<ref name="Fuhrer 2005"/> Fruit bodies may be isolated or spring up in groups or even [[fairy ring]]s.<ref name="Fuhrer 2005"/> It occurs in rainforest in the Cooloola section of the [[Great Sandy National Park]] in Queensland.<ref name=watling99/>

In New Zealand it is possibly associated with ''[[Nothofagus truncata]]''.<ref name="McNabb 1968"/> McNabb was unsure of whether it was introduced or indigenous to New Zealand though suspected it was the latter due to it being found in dense native forest near Rotorua. Other collections were in the vicinity of Auckland.<ref name="McNabb 1968"/>

It is common in Java and Sumatra.<ref name="Boedijn 1951"/>

In China it is found in Yunnan, Guangxi and Hainan provinces.<ref name="Ji2011">{{cite journal|author1=Kai-Ping Ji |author2=Yang Cao |author3=Chun-Xia Zhang |author4=Ming-Xia He |author5=Jing Liu |author6=Wen-Bing Wang |author7=Yun Wang |year=2011|title=Cultivation of ''Phlebopus portentosus'' in southern China|journal=Mycological Progress|volume=10|issue=3|pages=293–300|doi=10.1007/s11557-010-0700-7|bibcode=2011MycPr..10..293J |s2cid=19138490 }}</ref> In China, it grows in association with poinciana (''[[Delonix regia]]''), mango (''[[Mangifera indica]]''), coffee (''[[Coffea arabica]]''), pomelo (''[[Citrus grandis]]''), jackfruit (''[[Artocarpus heterophyllus]]'') and oak (''[[Quercus]]'') species.<ref name="Ji2011"/>

==Edibility==
As with many Australian mushrooms, ''Phlebopus marginatus'' is not widely eaten although recorded in several publications as edible and mild tasting or bland.<ref name="Griffiths 1985"/><ref name="Fuhrer 2005"/><ref name="Bougher 1998"/><ref name="Hilton 1988"/> Australian mushroom expert Bruce Fuhrer warns of its propensity to be maggot-ridden.<ref name="Fuhrer 2005"/>

It is consumed in  Laos, northern Thailand, Myanmar and southern China,<ref name=mortimer/> namely the tropical areas of Yunnan province, where excessive picking for markets has depleted wild populations. Its large size and flavour make it a desired mushroom in markets in the Xishuangbanna region.<ref name="Ji2011"/>
It is also consumed on the island of [[Réunion]]. 
Since 2003, efforts have been made to try and cultivate it.<ref name="Ji2011"/>
