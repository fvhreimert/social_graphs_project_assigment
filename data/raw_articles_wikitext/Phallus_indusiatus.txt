'''''Phallus indusiatus''''', commonly called the '''basket stinkhorn''',<ref name="Arora 1986"/> '''bamboo mushrooms''', '''bamboo pith''', '''long net stinkhorn''', '''crinoline stinkhorn''', '''bridal veil''', or '''veiled lady''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Phallaceae]], known as stinkhorns. First described scientifically in 1798 by French botanist [[Étienne Pierre Ventenat]], the species has often been referred to a separate genus ''Dictyophora'' along with other ''Phallus'' species featuring an indusium.

The [[fruit body]] is characterised by a conical to bell-shaped cap on a [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] and a delicate lacy "skirt", or [[indusium]], that hangs from beneath the cap and reaches nearly to the ground. The mature fruit bodies are up to {{convert|25|cm|in|0|abbr=off}} tall with a conical to bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that is {{convert|1.5–4|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide. The cap is covered with a greenish-brown [[gleba|spore-containing slime]], which attracts flies and other insects that eat the spores and disperse them. ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' can be distinguished from similar species by differences in [[range (biology)|distribution]], size, colour, and indusium length.

The species has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]] in [[tropical]] areas and is found in southern Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australia. It grows in woodlands and gardens in rich soil and well-rotted woody material. An [[edible mushroom]] featured as an ingredient in Chinese ''[[Chinese cuisine|haute cuisine]]'', it is used in [[stir frying|stir-fries]] and chicken soups. The mushroom, grown commercially and commonly sold in [[Asian supermarket|Asian markets]], is rich in [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], [[carbohydrate]]s, and [[dietary fiber]]. The mushroom also contains various [[biological activity|bioactive compounds]], and has [[antioxidant]] and [[antimicrobial]] properties. It has a [[recorded history]] of use in [[Chinese medicine]] extending back to the 7th&nbsp;century&nbsp;[[Common Era|CE]] and features in Nigerian folklore.

==Taxonomy==
''Phallus indusiatus'' was initially described by French naturalist [[Étienne Pierre Ventenat]] in 1798,<ref name="Ventenat 1798"/> and [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] under that name by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801.<ref name="Persoon 1801"/> One author anonymously gave his impressions of Ventenat's discovery in an 1800 publication:
<blockquote>This beautiful species, which is sufficiently characterised to distinguish it from every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly as far from the left bank of the river of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant,<ref group=N>Father of the more famous [[François Levaillant]], explorer and ornithologist, the elder Levaillant was a merchant of Metz who served as French consul in Dutch Guiana until 1763.</ref> who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque.<ref name="Anonymous 1800"/></blockquote> The fungus was later placed in a new genus, ''Dictyophora'', in 1809 by [[Nicaise Auguste Desvaux]];<ref name="Desvaux 1809"/> it was then known for many years as ''Dictyophora indusiata''.<ref name="Kirk 2008"/> [[Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck]] placed the species in ''Hymenophallus'' in 1817, as ''H.&nbsp;indusiatus''.<ref name="Nees 1817"/> Both genera were eventually returned to [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonyms]] of ''[[Phallus (fungus)|Phallus]]'' and the species is now known again by its original name.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Hymenophallus indusiatus"/><ref name="Kirk 2008"/>

[[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] described the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''rochesterensis'' in 1909, originally as a new species, ''Phallus rochesterensis''. It was found in [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]], Australia.<ref name="Lloyd 1902"/> A [[form (botany)|form]] with a pink-coloured indusium was reported by [[Vincenzo de Cesati]] in 1879 as ''Hymenophallus roseus'', and later called ''Dictyophora indusiata'' f.&nbsp;''rosea'' by [[Yosio Kobayasi]] in 1965;<ref name="urlMycoBank: Dictyophora indusiata f. rosea"/> it is synonymous with ''[[Phallus cinnabarinus]]''.<ref name="urlMushroom Expert: Phallus cinnabarinus"/> A taxon described in 1936 as ''Dictyophora lutea''<ref name="Liou 1936"/> and variously known for years as ''Dictyophora indusiata'' f.&nbsp;''lutea'', ''D.&nbsp;indusiata'' f.&nbsp;''aurantiaca'', or ''Phallus indusiatus'' f.&nbsp;''citrinus'', was formally transferred to ''Phallus'' in 2008 as a distinct species, [[Phallus luteus|''P.&nbsp;luteus'']].<ref name="Kasuya 2008"/>

===Etymology===
The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] is the [[Latin]] adjective {{lang|la|indūsǐātus}}, "wearing an undergarment".<ref name="Simpson 1979"/> The former generic name ''Dictyophora'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words [https://archive.today/20121215125021/http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.17:6:14.LSJ {{lang|grc|δίκτυον}}] (''diktyon'', "net"), and [https://archive.today/20121215062110/http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.79:3:158.LSJ {{lang|grc|φέρω}}] (''pherō'', "to bear"), hence "bearing a net".<ref name="Desvaux 1809"/><ref name="Liddell 1940"/> ''Phallus indusiatus'' has many [[common name]]s based on its appearance, including long net stinkhorn, crinoline stinkhorn,<ref name="Hall p.19">Hall (2003), p. 19.</ref> basket stinkhorn,<ref name="Arora 1986"/> bridal veil fungus,<ref name="Habtemariam 2019"/> and veiled lady. The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name {{Nihongo||衣笠茸 or キヌガサタケ|Kinugasatake}}, derived from the word ''kinugasa'', refers to the wide-brimmed hats that featured a hanging silk veil to hide and protect the wearer's face.<ref name="Inoki 2006"/> A [[Chinese language|Chinese]] common name that alludes to its typical growth habitat is "bamboo mushroom" ({{zh|s=竹荪|t=竹蓀|p=zhúsūn}}).<ref name="Ying 1987"/>

==Description==
.]]

Immature fruit bodies of ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' are initially enclosed in an egg-shaped to roughly spherical subterranean structure encased in a [[peridium]]. The "egg" ranges from whitish to [[buff (colour)|buff]] to reddish-brown, measures up to {{convert|6|cm|abbr=off|frac=4}} in diameter, and usually has a thick [[mycelial cord]] attached at the bottom.<ref name="Arora 1986" /> As the mushroom matures, the pressure caused by the enlargement of the internal structures cause the peridium to tear and the fruit body rapidly emerges from the "egg". The mature mushroom is up to {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on|frac=3}} tall and girded with a net-like structure called the [[indusium]] (or less technically a "skirt") that hangs down from the conical to bell-shaped cap. The netlike openings of the indusium may be polygonal or round in shape.<ref name="Chang p.344">Chang & Miles (2004), p. 344.</ref> Well-developed specimens have an indusium that reaches to the [[Volva (mycology)|volva]] and flares out somewhat before collapsing on the stalk.<ref name="Dissing 1962" />

The cap is {{convert|1.5–4|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide and its reticulated (pitted and ridged) surface is covered with a layer of greenish-brown and foul-smelling slime, the [[gleba]], which initially partially obscures the reticulations. The top of the cap has a small hole.<ref name="Arora 1986" /> The [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] is {{convert|7|–|25|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=2}} long,<ref name="Chang p.344" /> and {{convert|1.5–3|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick. The hollow stalk is white, roughly equal in width throughout its length, sometimes curved, and spongy. The ruptured peridium remains as a loose volva at the base of the stalk.<ref name="Arora 1986" /> Fruit bodies develop during the night,<ref name="Tuno 1998" /> The growth is very rapid. It can rise to a height of {{cvt|12.5|cm}} in a single hour between 7 and 8 am solar time<ref>{{cite book | last= Went | first= Fritz W. | date= 1963 | title= The Plants | location= New York | publisher= Time Inc. | pages= 100–101}}</ref> and to a height of {{cvt|21|cm}} by 9 am <ref>Bulletin du Jardin Botanique Buitenzorg, volume 12 (3rd series) issue 1 (1931) p.94</ref> and require 10–15 hours to fully develop after emerging from the peridium.<ref>Chang & Miles (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=XO4EGzpp1M0C&pg=PA348 p. 348.]</ref> They are short-lived, typically lasting no more than a few days.<ref name="Tuno 1998" /> At that point the slime has usually been removed by insects, leaving the pale off-white, bare cap surface exposed.<ref name="Chang p.344" /> The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are thin-walled, smooth, elliptical or slightly curved, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and measure 2–3 by 1–1.5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Trierveiler 2009" />

''[[Phallus multicolor]]'' is similar in overall appearance, but it has a more brightly coloured cap, stem and indusium, and it is usually smaller. It is found in Australia, Guam, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Papua New Guinea, Zaire, and Tobago <ref name="Burk 1978" /> as well as Hawaii. The cap of the Indo-Pacific species ''[[Phallus merulinus|P.&nbsp;merulinus]]'' appears smooth when covered with gleba, and is pale and wrinkled once the gleba has worn off. In contrast, the cap surface of ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' tends to have conspicuous reticulations that remain clearly visible under the gleba. Also, the indusium of ''P.&nbsp;merulinus'' is more delicate and shorter than that of ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'', and is thus less likely to collapse under its own weight.<ref name="Reid 1977" /> Common in eastern North America and Japan, and widely recorded in Europe,<ref name="Kibby 2012" /> the species ''[[Phallus duplicatus|P.&nbsp;duplicatus]]'' has a smaller indusium that hangs {{convert|3–6|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} from the bottom of the cap, and sometimes collapses against the stalk.<ref name="urlMushroom Expert: Phallus duplicatus" />

Found in Asia, Australia, Hawaii, southern Mexico, and Central and South America,<ref name="urlMushroom Expert: Phallus cinnabarinus" /> ''P.&nbsp;cinnabarinus'' grows to {{convert|13|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} tall, and has a more offensive odour than ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus''. It attracts flies from the genus ''[[Lucilia (fly)|Lucilia]]'' (family [[Calliphoridae]]), rather than the house flies of the genus ''[[Musca]]'' that visit ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus''.<ref name="Lee 1957" /> ''[[Phallus echinovolvatus|P.&nbsp;echinovolvatus]]'', described from China in 1988, is closely related to ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'', but can be distinguished by its volva that has a spiky ([[wikt:echinulate|echinulate]]) surface, and its higher preferred growth temperature of {{convert|30 to 35|C|F}}.<ref name="Zeng 1988" /> ''P.&nbsp;luteus'', originally considered a form of ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'', has a yellowish reticulate cap, a yellow indusium, and a pale pink to reddish-purple peridium and rhizomorphs. It is found in Asia and Mexico.<ref name="Kasuya 2008" />

==Distribution==
The range of ''Phallus indusiatus'' is [[tropical]], including Africa (Congo,<ref name="Dissing 1962"/> Nigeria,<ref name="Oso 1976"/> Uganda,<ref name="Maitland 1917"/> and Zaire),<ref name="Demoulin 1975"/> South America (Brazil<ref name="Trierveiler 2009"/> Guyana,<ref name="Wakefield 1934"/> and Venezuela),<ref name="Dennis 1960"/> Central America (Costa Rica),<ref name="Saenz 1982"/> and Tobago.<ref name="Dennis 1953"/> In North America, its range is restricted to Mexico.<ref name="Guzman 1973"/> Asian localities include Indonesia, Nepal, Malaysia,<ref name="Oldridge 1986"/> India,<ref name="Lloyd 1902"/> Southern China, Japan,<ref name="Tuno 1998"/> and Taiwan.<ref name="Chang 2000"/> It has also been collected in Australia.<ref name="Smith 2005"/>

==Ecology==
Like all ''Phallus'' species, ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' is [[saprobic]]—deriving nutrients from breaking down wood and plant organic matter. The fruit bodies grow singly or in groups in [[disturbed ground]] and among wood chips. In Asia, it grows among [[bamboo]] forests, and typically fruits after heavy rains.<ref name="Tuno 1998" /><ref>Hall (2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=yqHA_M7BVRcC&pg=PA247 p. 247].</ref> The method of reproduction for stinkhorns, including ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'', is different from most [[agaric]] mushrooms, which [[ballistospore|forcibly eject]] their spores. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass that has a sharp, sickly-sweet odour of [[carrion]].<ref name="Chang p.346">Chang & Miles (2004), p. 346.</ref> The cloying stink of mature fruit bodies—detectable from a considerable distance—is attractive to certain insects.<ref name="Tuno 1998" /> Species recorded visiting the fungus include [[stingless bees]] of the genus ''[[Trigona]]'',<ref name="Oliveria 2000" /> and flies of the families [[Drosophilidae]] and [[Muscidae]]. Insects assist in spore dispersal by consuming the gleba and depositing excrement containing intact spores to [[germinate]] elsewhere.<ref name="Tuno 1998" /> Although the function of the indusium is not known definitively, it may visually entice insects not otherwise attracted by the odour, and serve as a ladder for crawling insects to reach the gleba.<ref name="Kibby 1994" />

===Culinary===
In eastern Asia, ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' is considered a delicacy and an [[aphrodisiac]].<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> Previously only collected in the wild, where it is not abundant, it was difficult to procure. The mushroom's scarcity meant that it was usually reserved for special occasions. In the time of China's [[Qing dynasty]], the species was collected in [[Yunnan Province]] and sent to the [[Forbidden City|Imperial Palaces]] to satisfy the appetite of [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who particularly enjoyed meals containing edible fungi.<ref>Hu (2005), pp. 94–5.</ref> It was one of the eight featured ingredients of the "Bird's Nest Eight Immortals Soup" served at a banquet to celebrate her 60th birthday. This dish, served by descendants of the [[Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent|Confucius family]] in celebrations and longevity banquets, contained ingredients that were "all precious food, delicacies from land and sea, fresh, tender, and crisp, appropriately sweet and salty".<ref>Hu (2005), p. 96.</ref> Another notable use was a state banquet held for American diplomat [[Henry Kissinger]] on his [[1972 Nixon visit to China|visit to China]] to reestablish [[Sino-American relations|diplomatic relations]] in the early 1970s.<ref name="Chang 04">Chang & Miles (2004), p. 343.</ref> One source writes of the mushroom: "It has a fine and tender texture, fragrance and is attractive, beautiful in shape, fresh and crispy in taste."<ref>Hu (2005), p. 110.</ref> The dried fungus, commonly sold in [[Asian supermarket|Asian markets]], is prepared by rehydrating and soaking or simmering in water until tender.<ref name="Halpern 2007"/> Sometimes used in [[stir frying|stir-frys]], it is traditionally used as a component of rich chicken soups.<ref name="Dunlop 2003"/> The rehydrated mushroom can also be stuffed and cooked.<ref name="Newman 1999"/>
 
''Phallus indusiatus'' has been [[Fungiculture|cultivated]] on a commercial scale in China since 1979.<ref name="Chang 04" /> In the [[Fujian Province]] of China—known for a thriving mushroom industry that cultivates 45&nbsp;species of edible fungi—''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' is produced in the [[County (People's Republic of China)|counties]] of [[Fuan]], [[Jianou]], and [[Ningde]].<ref name="Hu 2004"/> Advances in cultivation have made the fungus cheaper and more widely available; in 1998, about {{convert|1100|MT}} were produced in China.<ref name="Hall p.19"/> The Hong Kong price for a kilogram of dried mushrooms reached around US&nbsp;$770 in 1982, but had dropped to US&nbsp;$100–200 by 1988. Additional advances led to it dropping further to US&nbsp;$10–20 by 2000.<ref name="Chang 04"/> The fungus is grown on agricultural wastes—bamboo-trash sawdust covered with a thin layer of non-sterilised soil. The optimal temperature for the growth of mushroom [[Spawn (biology)#Fungi|spawn]] and fruit bodies is about {{convert|24|C|F}}, with a [[relative humidity]] of 90–95%.<ref name="Yang 1987"/> Other [[substrate (biology)|substrates]] that can be used for the cultivation of the fungus include bamboo leaves and small stems, [[soybean]] pods or stems, corn stems, and [[willow]] leaves.<ref name="Zhou 1989"/>

===Medicinal===
{{More medical citations needed|reason=Claims are a little too strong. Should at least mention whether it has been found to help with anything in humans in a [[WP:MEDRS|MEDRS]].

Medicinal properties have been ascribed to ''Phallus indusiatus'' from the time of the Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] when it was described in [[pharmacopoeia]]. The fungus was used to treat many [[inflammation|inflammatory]], [[stomach disease|stomach]], and [[neurological disorder|neural diseases]]. Southern China's [[Miao people]] continue to use it traditionally for a number of afflictions, including injuries and pains, cough, [[dysentery]], [[enteritis]], [[leukemia]], and [[feebleness]], and it has been prescribed clinically as a treatment for [[laryngitis]], [[leucorrhea]], fever, and [[oliguria]] (low urine output), [[diarrhea]], [[hypertension]], cough, [[hyperlipidemia]], and in anticancer therapy.<ref name="Ker 2011" /> Modern science has probed the biochemical basis of these putative medicinal benefits.

The fruit bodies of the fungus contain [[biological activity|biologically active]] [[polysaccharide]]s. A [[beta-glucan|β-<small>D</small>-glucan]] called T-5-N and prepared from [[alkaline]] extracts<ref name="Ukai 1982" /> has been shown to have [[anti-inflammatory]] properties.<ref name="Hara 1982" /> Its chemical structure is a linear chain backbone made largely of α-1→3 linked <small>D</small>-[[Mannose|mannopyranosyl]] residues, with traces of 1→6 linked <small>D</small>-mannopyrosyl residues.<ref name="Ukai 1980" /> The polysaccharide has tumour-suppressing activity against [[subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneously]] implanted [[sarcoma]]&nbsp;180 (a&nbsp;transplantable, [[metastasis|non-metastasizing]] connective tissue [[tumour]] often used in research) in mice.<ref name="Hara 1982" /><ref name="Ukai 1983" />

Another chemical of interest found in ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' is [[hydroxymethylfurfural]],<ref name="Sharma 2004" /> which has attracted attention as a [[tyrosinase]] inhibitor. Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial steps of [[melanogenesis]] in mammals, and is responsible for the undesirable [[browning (food process)#Enzymatic browning|browning]] reactions in damaged fruits during post-harvest handling and processing,<ref name="Chang 2009" /> and its inhibitors are of interest to the medical, cosmetics, and food industries. Hydroxymethylfurfural, which occurs naturally in several foods, is not associated with serious health risks.<ref name="Sharma 2004" /> ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' also contains a unique [[ribonuclease]] (an [[enzyme]] that cuts [[RNA]] into smaller components) possessing several biochemical characteristics that differentiate it from other known mushroom ribonucleases.<ref name="Wang 2003" />

Two novel [[sesquiterpene]]s, [[dictyophorine]] A and B, have been identified from the fruit bodies of the fungus. These compounds, based on the eudesmane skeleton (a common structure found in plant-derived flavours and fragrances), are the first eudesmane [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] isolated from fungi and were found to promote the synthesis of [[nerve growth factor]] in [[astroglial cell]]s.<ref name="Kawagishi 1997" /> Related compounds isolated and identified from the fungus include three [[quinazoline]] derivatives (a class of compounds rare in nature), dictyoquinazol A, B, and C.<ref name="Lee 2002" /> These chemicals were shown in laboratory tests to have a protective effect on [[cell culture|cultured]] mouse [[neuron]]s that had been exposed to [[neurotoxin]]s.<ref name="Liu 2005" /> A [[total synthesis]] for the dictyoquinazols was reported in 2007.<ref name="Oh 2007" />

The fungus has long been recognised to have [[antibacterial]] properties: the addition of the fungus to soup broth was known to prevent it from spoiling for several days.<ref name="Huang 2011" /> One of the responsible antibiotics, [[albaflavenone]], was isolated in 2011. It is a [[sesquiterpenoid]] that was already known from the soil bacterium ''[[Streptomyces albidoflavus]]''.<ref name="Huang 2011" /> Experiments have shown that extracts of ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' have [[antioxidant]] in addition to [[antimicrobial]] properties in chemical assays.<ref name="Mau 2002" />

A 2001 publication in the ''[[International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms]]'' attempted to determine its efficacy as an [[aphrodisiac]]. In the trial involving sixteen women, six self-reported the experience of a mild orgasm while smelling the fruit body, and the other ten, who received smaller doses, self-reported an increased [[heart rate]]. All of the twenty men tested considered the smell displeasing. The study used fruit bodies found in Hawaii, not the edible variety cultivated in China.<ref name="Holliday 2001" />  The study has received criticism.  A way to achieve instant orgasms would be expected to gain much attention and many attempts to reproduce the effect, but none has succeeded.  No major science journal has published the study, and there are no studies where the results have been reproduced.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/2016/02/14/hawaii-orgasm-mushroom/ |title=Expedition Ecstasy: Sniffing Out The Truth About Hawai'i's Orgasm-Inducing Mushroom |access-date=2017-05-25 |archive-date=2019-10-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025222119/http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/science-sushi/2016/02/14/hawaii-orgasm-mushroom/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>[http://www.sciencealert.com/can-a-rare-hawaiian-mushroom-really-give-women-a-spontaneous-orgasm Can a Rare Hawaiian Mushroom Really Give Women a "Spontaneous Orgasm"?]</ref>

==In culture==
According to ethnomycologist [[R. Gordon Wasson]], ''P.&nbsp;indusiatus'' was consumed in Mexican [[divination|divinatory]] ceremonies on account of its suggestive shape. On the other side of the globe, [[New Guinea]] natives consider the mushroom sacred.<ref name="Spooner 1994">{{cite journal |vauthors=Spooner B, Læssøe T |title=The folklore of 'Gasteromycetes' |journal=Mycologist |year=1994 |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=119–23 |doi=10.1016/S0269-915X(09)80157-2}}</ref> In Nigeria, the mushroom is one of several stinkhorns given the name ''Akufodewa'' by the [[Yoruba people]].
