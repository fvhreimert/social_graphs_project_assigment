'''''Craterellus''''' is a [[genus]] of generally [[edible mushroom|edible]] fungi similar to the closely related [[Cantharellus|chanterelles]], with some new species recently moved from the latter to the former. Both groups lack true [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of their caps, though they often have gill-like wrinkles and ridges.

== General ==
The three most common species, ''[[Craterellus cornucopioides|C. cornucopioides]]'', ''[[Craterellus lutescens|C. lutescens]]'' and ''[[Craterellus tubaeformis|C. tubaeformis]]'', are gathered commercially and, unlike ''[[Cantharellus]]'', can be easily preserved by drying.

[[Molecular phylogenetics]] have been applied to the problem of discriminating between ''Craterellus'' and ''Cantharellus'' genera.  Results indicate that the presence of a hollow stipe may be a [[synapomorphy]] (a trait corresponding to the evolutionary relationship) which reliably identifies ''Craterellus'' species.  ''C. cornucopioides'' appears to be a single [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]] species, while ''C. tubaeformis'' may be two separate genetic groups separated by geography.<ref name=Dahlman/>

}}

The genera '''''Craterellus''''' and ''Cantharellus'' have always been recognized as closely related.  The whole group may be recognized by their lack of division into cap and stipe, and their rudimentary or missing [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] ("false gills").<ref name=Dahlman/><ref name=TomVolk/>  Originally ''Cantharellus'' was defined by [[Elias Magnus Fries|Fries]] in 1821 to mean all these species together<ref name=IF1/> and then in 1825 [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon|Persoon]] separated some species off to create the '''Craterellus''' group, with ''[[Craterellus cornucopioides|Cr. cornucopioides]]'' as [[type species]].<ref name=IF2/>  Since then some authorities have tried to merge the two genera again,<ref name=KR/> but DNA studies now indicate that (with recent changes) each genus is [[monophyletic]], and so they are likely to remain separate.<ref name=Moncalvo/>

In the past ''Craterellus'' was distinguished on the basis that<ref name=Dahlman/><ref name=KR/> 
#the fruiting body had a hollow stipe, generally being funnel-shaped, and
#there were no [[clamp connections]].

But phylogenetic DNA work starting with the 2000 paper of Dahlman et al.<ref name=Dahlman/> has shown that some species traditionally placed in ''Cantharellus'' (''C. tubaeformis'', ''C. ignicolor'' and ''C. lutescens'') really belong in ''Craterellus'', and this means that the second distinguishing rule is no longer valid.  On the other hand, the first rule holds up well.

==Species==

The taxonomy of these fungi is in a state of flux (particularly due to DNA analysis) and many earlier names are now disputed.  The following table gives some of the most important ones.  Numerous species of ''Cantharellus'' have at times been classified under ''Craterellus'', but these are mostly excluded from the table.  See also the [[cladogram]] at right for a portrayal of the relationships between the species based on recent evidence.
