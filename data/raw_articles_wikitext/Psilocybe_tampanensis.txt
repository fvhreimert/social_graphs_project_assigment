'''''Psilocybe tampanensis''''' is a very rare [[psychedelic mushroom]] in the family [[Hymenogastraceae]]. Originally collected in the wild in a sandy meadow near [[Tampa, Florida]], in 1977, the fungus would not be found in [[Florida]] again until 44 years later.<ref>Doc Lingo (Accessed through MyCoPortal Data Portal, http://mycoportal.org/portal/index.php, 2018-05-26)</ref> The original Florida specimen was [[cloning|cloned]], and descendants remain in wide circulation. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) produced by the fungus are yellowish-brown in color with convex to conic [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|2.4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter atop a thin [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] up to {{convert|6|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. ''Psilocybe tampanensis'' forms psychoactive [[truffle]]-like [[sclerotia]] that are known and sold under the nickname "philosopher's stones". The fruit bodies and sclerotia are consumed by some for [[recreational drug use|recreational]] or [[entheogen]]ic purposes. In nature, sclerotia are produced by the fungus as a rare form of protection from [[wildfire]]s and other natural disasters.

==Taxonomy==
The species was [[species description|described]] scientifically by [[Steven H. Pollock]] and Mexican mycologist and ''[[Psilocybe]]'' authority [[Gastón Guzmán]] in a 1978 ''[[Mycotaxon]]'' publication.<ref name=Guzman1978/> According to [[Paul Stamets]], Pollock skipped a "boring taxonomic conference" near [[Tampa, Florida]] to go [[mushroom hunting]], and found a single specimen growing in a sand dune, which he did not recognize. Pollock later [[cloning|cloned]] the specimen and produced a [[pure culture]], which remains widely distributed today.<ref name=Stamets1996/> The [[type (biology)|type]] specimen is kept at the [[herbarium]] of the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional]] in Mexico.<ref name=Guzman1978/> Guzmán [[classification (biology)|classified]] ''P.&nbsp;tampanensis'' in his [[section (botany)|section]] ''Mexicanae'', a grouping of related ''Psilocybe'' species characterized primarily by having [[spore]]s with lengths greater than 8&nbsp;[[micrometre|micrometer]]s.<ref>Guzmán (1983), p. 199.</ref><ref name=Guzman1995/>

==Description==
s of cultivated specimens]]
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] ranges in shape from [[Wikt:convex|convex]] or conic with a slight [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], expanding in age to become flattened or with a slight central depression; it reaches diameters of {{convert|1|–|2.4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}}. The surface is smooth, not striate (grooved), [[ochraceous]] brown to straw brown, [[buff (color)|buff]] to yellowish-grey when dry, with slight bluish tones at the margin, [[hygrophanous]], and somewhat sticky when wet. The gills are more or less [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] (broadly attached to the stem slightly above the bottom of the gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem) and brown to dark purple brown in color with lighter edges. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|2|–|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|1|–|2|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick, and equal in width throughout to slightly enlarged near the base. There are fibrils near the top of the stem. The [[partial veil]] is cortinate (cobweb-like, similar to the partial veil of ''[[Cortinarius]]'' species), and soon disappears. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish to yellowish, and bruises blue when injured. The taste and odor are slightly [[farinaceous]] (similar to freshly ground flour).<ref name=Guzman1978/><ref name=Guzman1996/>

The [[spore print]] is purple-brown. When viewed with a [[light microscopy|microscope]], the [[spore]]s of ''P.&nbsp;tampanensis'' are somewhat [[rhombus|rhombic]] in face view and roughly elliptical in side view; they have dimensions of 8.8–9.9 by 7–8.8 by 5.5–6.6&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. Spores appear brownish-yellow when mounted in a solution of [[potassium hydroxide]], and have a thick, smooth wall, a distinct [[germ pore]], and a short appendage. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, [[hyaline]] (translucent), and measure 14–22 by 8–10&nbsp;μm. The cheilocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) measure 16–22 by 4–9&nbsp;μm, and are [[wikt:lageniform|lageniform]] (flask-shaped) with [[wikt:flexuous|flexuous]] thin necks that are 2.2–3&nbsp;μm thick, and infrequently have irregular branches. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the [[hypha]]e.<ref name=Guzman1978/>

===Similar species===
Guzmán considers ''Psilocybe tampanensis'' to be intermediate in form between ''[[Psilocybe mexicana|P.&nbsp;mexicana]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe caerulescens|P.&nbsp;caerulescens]]''. ''Psilocybe mexicana'' has a more ''[[Mycena]]''-like fruit body shape, and longer basidia measuring 22–24 by 7.7–11&nbsp;μm. It is known only from Mexico and Guatemala. ''Psilocybe caerulescens'', found in the US and Venezuela, is also somewhat similar, but has a collybioid [[habit (biology)|habit]] (small to medium-sized mushrooms with a convex cap), with spores measuring 6.7–8 by 5.2–6.5 by 3.3–5.2&nbsp;μm, and cheilocystidia that are 15–22 by 4.4–5.5&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Guzman1978/>

==Habitat and distribution==
For almost two decades after its discovery, ''Psilocybe tampanensis'' was known only from the [[type locality (biology)|type locality]], southeast of [[Brandon, Florida]]. In 1996, Guzmán reported finding it in a meadow with sandy soil in a [[deciduous forest]] in [[Pearl River County]], [[Mississippi]], a habitat similar to that of the type location.<ref name=Guzman1996/> Due to its scarcity, however, its habitat preferences are not known with certainty.<ref name=Beug2011/> Like all ''Psilocybe'' species, it is [[saprobic]].<ref>Guzmán (1983), p. 22.</ref>

Like some other psychoactive grassland species such as ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'', ''[[Conocybe cyanopus]]'', ''P.&nbsp;tampanensis'' can form [[sclerotia]]–a hardened mass of [[mycelia]] that is more resistant to adverse environmental conditions than normal mycelia. This [[truffle]]-like form gives the fungus some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters.<ref name=Stamets2000/> Other ''Psilocybe'' species known to produce sclerotia include ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe caerulescens]]''.<ref name=Guzman1978/> Sclerotia are also produced when the species is grown in culture.<ref name=Stamets1983/>

==Recreational use==
''Psilocybe tampanensis'' contains the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] compounds [[psilocin]] and [[psilocybin]], and is consumed for [[recreational drug use|recreational]] and [[entheogen]]ic purposes. The species was found to be one of the most popular psychoactive mushrooms confiscated by German authorities in a 2000 report, behind ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'', ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'', and ''[[Panaeolus cyanescens]]''. The alkaloid content in the confiscated samples ranged from not detectable to 0.19% psilocybin, and 0.01 to 0.03% psilocin.<ref name=Musshoff2000/> According to mycologist Michael Beug, dried fruit bodies can contain up to 1% psilocybin and psilocin;<ref name=Beug2011/> in terms of psychoactive [[potency (pharmacology)|potency]], Stamets considers the mushroom "moderately to highly active".<ref name=Stamets1996/>

The psychoactive compounds are also present in the [[sclerotia]]: in one analysis, the levels of psilocybin obtained from sclerotia ranged from 0.31% to 0.68% by [[dry weight]], and were dependent upon the composition of the [[growth medium]].<ref name=Gartz1994/> Sclerotia are sold under the nickname "philosopher's stones".<ref name=EMCDDA/> They have been described as "resembling congealed [[muesli]]", and having a somewhat bitter taste similar to [[walnut]].<ref name=Honigsbaum2003/> Strains existing as commercial cultivation kits sold originally in [[Counterculture|countercultural]] drug magazines are derived from the original fruit body found by Pollock in Florida.<ref name=Ott1996/> Methods were originally developed by Pollock,<ref name=Pollock1979/> and later extended by Stamets in the 1980s to [[mushroom cultivation|cultivate]] the sclerotia on a [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] of rye grass (''[[Lolium]]''), and on straw. Sclerotia prepared in this way take from 3 to 12&nbsp;weeks to develop.<ref name=Gartz1997/> Pollock was granted a [[United States patent law|US patent]] in 1981 for his method of producing sclerotia.<ref name=Pollock1979/>

===Legal status===
{{main|Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms}}
Psilocin and psilocybin are [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs#Schedules of drugs|scheduled]] drugs in many countries, and mushrooms containing them are prohibited by extension. In the United States, [[Law of the United States#Levels of law|Federal law]] was passed in 1971 that put the psychoactive components into the most restricted [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|schedule I]] category. For about three decades following this, several European countries remained relatively tolerant of mushroom use and possession. In the 2000s (decade), in response to increases in prevalence and availability, all European countries banned possession or sale of psychedelic mushrooms;<ref name=EMCDDA/> the Netherlands was the last country to enact such laws in 2008.<ref name=Marley2010/> However, they did not include psilocybin-containing sclerotia in the 2008 law, and thus, psilocybin-containing fungal compounds are available commercially in the Netherlands.<ref name=Amsterdam2011/> In parallel legal developments in Asia, ''P.&nbsp;tampanensis'' was one of 13 psychoactive mushrooms specifically prohibited by law in Japan in 2002.<ref name=Gonmori2009/>
