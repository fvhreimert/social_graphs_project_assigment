== Description ==
The fruit bodies grow to {{convert|10|cm|frac=2}} broad and 6&nbsp;cm high with a yellowish [[peridium]], or outer skin.<ref name=Arora1986>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/708/mode/2up |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=708}}</ref>

Earthballs are superficially similar to, and considered look-alikes of, the edible [[puffball]] (particularly ''[[Apioperdon pyriforme]]''), but whereas the puffball has a single opening on top through which the [[spore]]s are dispersed, the earthball just breaks up to release the spores. Moreover, ''S.&nbsp;citrinum'' has much firmer flesh and a dark [[gleba]] (interior) much earlier in development than puffballs. ''Scleroderma citrinum'' has no stem but is attached to the soil by [[mycelial]] cords. The peridium is thick and firm, usually ochre yellow externally with irregular warts.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Found in Europe and in North America, it is the most common species of earthball fungus in the [[United Kingdom]] and occurs widely in woods, heathland and in short grass from autumn to winter. ''S.&nbsp;citrinum'' has two synonyms, ''S.&nbsp;aurantium'' (Vaill.) and ''Scleroderma vulgare'' Horn.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Pekşen, Aysun and Gürsel Karaca |year=2003 |title=Macrofungi of Samsun Province |url=http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/botany/issues/bot-03-27-3/bot-27-3-3-0204-3.pdf |journal=Turkish Journal of Botany |volume=27 |pages=173–184}}</ref>

== Ecology ==
''Scleroderma citrinum'' is an [[ectomycorrhiza]]l fungus with a [[symbiotic]] relationship with tree species, and can influence the diversity of soil bacterial communities under some tree species.{{cn|date=August 2025}}

The earthball may be parasitized by ''[[Pseudoboletus parasiticus]]''.

== Toxicity ==
''Scleroderma citrinum'' is [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]]<ref name=Arora1986/> and can be mistaken with [[truffle]]s by inexperienced mushroom hunters. Ingestion of ''S.&nbsp;citrinum'' can cause [[gastrointestinal distress]] in humans and animals. Some individuals may experience [[lacrimation]], [[rhinitis]] and [[rhinorrhea]], and [[conjunctivitis]] from exposure to its spores.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=October 2006 |url=http://www.svims.ca/ff0610.pdf |title=Reflections on Mushroom Poisoning – Part III |magazine=Fungifama: The Newsletter of the South Vancouver Island Mycological Society |via=svims.ca |access-date=2007-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hoffman |first=Ursula |url=http://www.nemf.org/files/lincoff/beginners/poison.html |title=Poisonous Mushrooms in Northeastern North America |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040607082012/http://www.nemf.org/files/lincoff/beginners/poison.html |archive-date=2004-06-07 |publisher=NorthEast Mycological Federation, Inc. |access-date=2007-09-17}}</ref>

Pigments found in the fruiting body of ''S.&nbsp;citrinum'' Pers. are [[sclerocitrin]], [[norbadione&nbsp;A]], [[xerocomic acid]], and [[badione&nbsp;A]].
