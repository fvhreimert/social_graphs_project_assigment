'''''Amanita liquii''''', also known as the '''dark-faced ringless amanita''', is a species of [[agaric]] that fruits from July to September.

This large and robust agaric ([[pileus (mycology)|cap]] diameter up to {{Convert|14|cm|abbr=off|disp=or|frac=2}}, [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] length up to 17&nbsp;cm) is distinguishable by its very dark, sometimes almost black, overall colour. The scientific name is taken from the Chinese hero [[Li Kui (novel character)|Li Kui]] (sometimes spelled '''Li Qui'''), who had a dark face.

It is associated with [[fir]]s and [[pine]]s in south-western China up to an altitude of 4,000 metres.
