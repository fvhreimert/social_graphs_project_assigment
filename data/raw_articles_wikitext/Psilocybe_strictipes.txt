'''''Psilocybe strictipes''''' is a [[mushroom]] that grows on grassy meadows and lawns;  It is found throughout the cool [[temperate]] and [[subarctic]] regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and it is most common in Europe, and the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America.  It contains the psychoactive compound [[psilocybin]] is closely related to ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe pelliculosa]]''.  ''Psilocybe strictipes'' is commonly confused with ''Psilocybe semilanceata'' and can be differentiated by its lack of a [[wikt:papilla|papilla]] and a convex to subumbonate cap. "Strictipes" comes from the [[Latin]] words ''stricti'' (narrow) and ''pes'' (foot).

==Description==
''Psilocybe strictipes'' has a [[farinaceous]] smell and taste.  [[Pleurocystidia]] are absent and its [[wikt:lageniform|lageniform]] [[cheilocystidia]] are 21-45 by 7-10 [[μm]]. The cap is 5 to 30&nbsp;mm across, [[wiktionary:conical|conic]] to [[wiktionary:campanulate|campanulate]] to [[wiktionary:convex|convex]], smooth, and [[translucent-striate]] near the margin, often with a low [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]]. It is walnut brown to dark rusty brown, with a smooth surface and a separable gelatinous [[Pellicle (mycology)|pellicle]]. It is [[Hygrophanous]], fading to buff as it dries.  The flesh sometimes stains blue where damaged. The gills are cream-colored when young and dark purple brown when mature, with an [[Adnation|adnate]] attachment. The [[spore]]s are dark purple brown, suboblong, and 11 by 6 [[μm]]. The stipe has a white to ocher, equal, tough, and [[cartilaginous]] structure with [[fibrillose]] patches. It is 4 to 10&nbsp;cm long and around .25&nbsp;cm thick.  The [[partial veil]] is thin, [[cortinate]], and does not usually leave any remnants on the stipe.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Psilocybe strictipes'' fruits in late summer to fall in [[Chile]], [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Sweden]], [[Siberia]], and the [[Pacific Northwest]].
''Psilocybe strictipes'' is found in lawns and grassy fields but never growing directly from dung.
