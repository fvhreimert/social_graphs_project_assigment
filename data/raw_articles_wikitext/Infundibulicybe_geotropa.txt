'''''Infundibulicybe geotropa''''', also known as the '''trooping funnel''' or '''monk's head''', is a large [[funnel]]-shaped [[mushroom]] with a sturdy cream or buff colour. It grows widely in Europe and (less commonly) in North America in mixed woodlands, often in troops or fairy rings, one of which is over half a mile wide. Although edible, it could be confused with some poisonous species of similar colouration and size.

==Taxonomy==
French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] initially described the trooping funnel as ''Agaricus geotropus'' in 1792, before [[Lucien Quélet]] renamed it ''Clitocybe geotropa'' (a name by which it was long known) in 1872. Its specific epithet derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words {{lang|grc|γῆ}}/''gē'' "earth", and τρόπος/''tropos'' "turn".<ref name=Nilper1977>{{cite book |author1=Nilson, Sven |author2=Persson, Olle |year=1977 |title=Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-14-063006-6 |page=38}}</ref>

Finnish mycologist Harri Harmaja proposed ''I.&nbsp;geotropa'' and twelve other ''Clitocybe'' species be split off into a new genus ''Infundibulicybe'', thus the new binomial name is ''Infundibulicybe geotropa''.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Notes on ''Clitocybe s. lato'' (Agaricales) |author=Harmaja, Harri|year=2003|url=http://www.sekj.org/PDF/anb40-free/anb40-213.pdf|journal=Annales Botanici Fennici|volume=40|pages=213–18}}</ref>

==Description==


A cream- or [[Buff (colour)|buff]]-coloured mushroom, the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] may reach {{convert|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter. It has a prominent boss and looks small in relation to the large stem in young specimens. As the mushroom ages, the cap changes from convex with inrolled margins to more funnel shaped. The decurrent [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are the same colour as the cap. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is bulbous, larger at the base and {{convert|10|–|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high. The [[spore print]] is white. There is a sweet smell,<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Phillips, Roger | year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page= 91}}</ref> which has been likened to the odour of bitter almonds.<ref name=Nilper1977/> The white flesh is firm in young specimens.<ref name=haas>{{cite book | author = Haas, Hans | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi |page= 130| publisher = Burke | isbn = 0-222-79409-7}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
Trooping funnel is found in mixed woodlands, especially grassy clearings, in autumn. Often gregarious, it can form [[fairy ring]]s, and has a complex mycelium.<ref name=Nilper1977/><ref name=Phillips06/> It is abundant and widespread in Europe (August to November),<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |pages=134}}</ref> and less common in North America.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bigelow, Howard Elson|title=North American species of Clitocybe|publisher=J.

One fairy ring in [[Belfort]], eastern France, has been reported at over half a mile in diameter and estimated at 800 years of age.

==Edibility==
Only young mushrooms are recommended for eating, as older ones lose their pleasant taste,<ref name=haas/> and the flesh becomes leathery in consistency. The stipes of all aged specimens are generally discarded.<ref name=Lamaison05/> The fungus is popular in northern Italy, where it is roasted or cooked in stews and frittatas, or preserved in oil.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clifford A.
