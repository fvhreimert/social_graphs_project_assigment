Although it has [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]], it is a member of the order [[Boletales]], along with the boletes. The fruiting bodies sprout in pine, fir and spruce woodland in Europe in autumn.

==Taxonomy==
''Gomphidius glutinosus'' was initially described by [[Germany|German]] mycologist [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] as ''Agaricus glutinosus'' in 1774, in his series on fungi of [[Bavaria]] and the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]], ''Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur icones.''<ref name="Schaeffer 1774">{{cite book |author=Schäffer JC. |title=Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur icones, nativis coloribus expressae |year=1774 |volume=4 |publisher=Apud J.J.

In 1971, Miller described two varieties: ''G. glutinosus'' var. ''purpureus'' from a specimen collected near [[Nordman, Idaho]]. More drab purple to wine-coloured, this taxon is native th the Rockies in Idaho, Montana and Alberta. ''G. glutinosus'' var. ''salmoneus'' was described from [[Kaniksu National Forest]] in Idaho. With a salmon-coloured cap, it is native to northern and central Idaho as far south as [[Payette National Forest]].<ref name=Miller1971/>

Alternate common names in Germany are ''Kuhmaul'' "cow snout",<ref name=Nilper/> and ''Rotzer''.<ref name=Zeitl76>{{cite book|last=Zeitlmayr |first= Linus|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|publisher=Garden City Press, Hertfordshire|isbn= 978-0-584-10324-3|pages=93–94}}</ref>

==Description==

Said to resemble a child's [[Spinning top|top]], the mushroom has a dull dark purple, dark brownish or greyish [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] ranging from {{Cvt|3-12|cm|frac=8}} in diameter;<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=202–203|oclc=797915861}}</ref> it has a central boss and an inrolled margin, and is initially convex and later flattens and may develop blackish markings.<ref name=Nilper/> The cap surface is smooth and sticky.<ref name=Miller1971/> As with other members of the genus, the whole mushroom is often covered with slimy or sticky veil when young. The fungus tears free of the veil as it grows, leaving some strands and an indistinct [[annulus (mycology)|ring]].<ref name=Zeitl76/> The white [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 4&ndash;10&nbsp;cm tall and 0.7–2&nbsp;cm wide, and narrows toward the base, which is yellow. The yellow segment stains dark green to black with [[Melzer's reagent]].<ref name=Miller1971/> The whitish flesh may have a wine-coloured tinge and has little taste or smell. The widely spaced decurrent gills are waxy in texture, with a hairy surface from the [[cystidia]].<ref name=Zeitl76/> Sometimes branched, they are initially whitish, then grey and later blackening with [[Basidiospore|spores]]. The [[spore print]] is brownish-black. The large spores are spindle-shaped and measure 17&ndash;20&nbsp;μm long by 5.5&ndash;6&nbsp;μm wide.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | first= Roger | last=Phillips | year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 978-0-330-44237-4|page=270}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Gomphidius glutinosus'' is found in Eurasia and North America up to elevations of 9600&nbsp;ft, and is generally abundant across its range. It occurs in autumn under various species of conifer—both in natural woods and plantations—such as balsam fir (''[[Abies balsamea]]''), Norway spruce (''[[Picea abies]]'') and grand fir (''[[Abies grandis]]''). The mushrooms may be single, scattered, or occasionally growing in clumps.<ref name=Miller1971/><!-- cites previous 3 sentences --> Fruiting bodies sprout in the autumn,<ref name=Phillips06/> to as late as December in northern California.<ref name=Miller1971/>

==Ecology==
Like other members of the family Gomphidiaceae, ''Gomphidius glutinosus ''has been thought to be [[ectomycorrhizal]], forming symbiotic relationship with their host trees.<ref name="olsson"/> However, there is now evidence that many (and perhaps all) species in this group are [[parasitic]] upon ectomycorrhizal [[boletes]], in relationships that are often highly species-specific, such as ''[[Gomphidius roseus]]'' upon ''[[Suillus bovinus]]''.<ref name="olsson">{{Cite journal

Two specimens of ''Gomphidius glutinosus'' were found in [[Brechfa Forest]] on the 25th Of July 2009. The only boletus to be found in the vicinity was ''[[Suillus grevillei]]''.

''G. glutinosus'' is a hyper-[[bioaccumulation|accumulating]] fungus that absorbs and concentrates elements such as [[cesium]] more than 10,000-fold over background levels. This property can be used to decontaminate sites contaminated with radioactive [[cesium-137]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Stamets |first=Paul |date=2011  |title=How Mushrooms Can Clean Up Radioactive Contamination - An 8 Step Plan |url=http://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/how-mushrooms-can-clean-radioactive-contamination-8-step-plan |journal=Permaculture - Practical Solutions for Self-reliance}}</ref>

==Edibility==
Opinions differ on the suitability of this mushroom for the table, some guides hold it in high regard,<ref name=Lamaison05/> while others view it with caution.<ref name=Phillips06/> ''Gomphidius glutinosus'' has a mild flavour well-suited for cooking with other mushrooms, and in soups and stews.<ref name=Zeitl76/> It is not suited for drying. Removing the slime and skin of the cap is recommended as soon as possible after picking. Maggots only rarely attack this species.<ref name=Zeitl76/> However, it accumulates heavy metals.<ref name=":1" />
