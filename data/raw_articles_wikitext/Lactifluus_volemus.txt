'''''Lactifluus volemus''''', formerly known as '''''Lactarius volemus''''', and commonly known as the '''weeping milk cap''' or '''bradley''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Russulaceae]]. [[Phylogenetic]] analysis suggests that ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' represents several species or [[subspecies]], rather than a single [[taxon]].

The colour of the mushroom varies from [[apricot (color)|apricot]] to [[tawny (color)|tawny]], and the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] may be up to 11&nbsp;cm ({{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;in) wide. The pale golden yellow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the large amount of [[latex]] ("milk") that it exudes when the gills are damaged, leading to some of its [[common name]]s, e.g. '''voluminous-latex milky'''. It also has a distinctive fishy smell, which does not affect the taste. The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several [[sterol]]s related to [[ergosterol]], some of which are unique to this species. The mushroom also contains a [[natural rubber]] that has been chemically characterized. ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' produces a white [[spore print]] and has roughly spherical [[spore]]s about 7–8&nbsp;[[micrometre]]s in diameter. Several other ''Lactifluus'' mushrooms resemble ''L.&nbsp;volemus'', such as the closely related edible species ''[[Lactifluus corrugis|L.&nbsp;corrugis]]'', but these can be distinguished by differences in distribution, visible [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and microscopic characteristics.

''L.&nbsp;volemus'' is widely distributed in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], in [[temperate]] regions of Eurasia and North America, as well as some subtropical and tropical regions of Asia and Central America. A [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, its [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] grow on the ground at the base of various species of trees from summer to autumn, either individually or in groups. It is valued as an [[edible mushroom]] and is sold in some Asian markets.

==Taxonomy==
The first mention of ''Lactifluus volemus'' in the scientific literature was in  [[Carl Linnaeus]]'s 1753 ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', under the name ''Agaricus lactifluus''.<ref name=Linnaeus1753/> In 1821, Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] called it ''Agaricus volemus'' in his ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]''.<ref name=Fries1821/> In this work he proposed a grouping of related species (called a ''tribus'', or tribe) within the genus ''Agaricus'', which he named ''Galorrheus''. Fries later recognised ''Lactarius'' as a distinct genus in his 1838 ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici'', citing ''Galorrheus'' as a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]].<ref name="urlFungorum - Species synonymy"/><ref name=Fries1838/> Although Linnaeus had published the species before Fries, Fries's name is [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] and thus has [[Priority (nomenclature)|nomenclatural priority]]. In 1871 [[Paul Kummer]] raised most of Fries's tribes to generic rank, and so renamed the species ''Galorrheus volemus''.<ref name=Kummer1871/> The [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' var. ''subrugosus'' was identified by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1879,<ref name=Peck1885/> but is now classified as a separate species, ''[[Lactifluus corrugis|L.&nbsp;corrugis]]''.<ref name="Roody"/> In 1891, [[Otto Kuntze]] moved the species into ''Lactifluus'',<ref name=Kuntze1891/> which was afterwards long considered a synonym of ''Lactarius'' but confirmed as a separate genus through [[molecular phylogenetics]] in 2008 and subsequent taxonomical rearrangements within the family Russulaceae.<ref name="Buyck2008"/><ref name="Buyck2010"/><ref name="verbeken2013"/>

Another historical synonym is ''Lactarius lactifluus'', used by [[Lucien Quélet]] in 1886,<ref name=Quelet1886/> a renaming based on Linnaeus's ''Agaricus lactifluus''. ''Lactarius wangii'', reported by Hua-An Wen and Jian-Zhe Ying to be a new species from China in 2005,<ref name="Wen2005"/> was synonymised two years later with ''L.&nbsp;volemus''.<ref name=Wang2007/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] "''volemus''" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''vola'',<ref name=Frieze1882/> meaning "the hollow of the hand", suggestive of Fries's reference to the large amount of latex "flowing enough to fill the hand".<ref name="Metzler"/> [[Common name]]s for ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' include the weeping milk cap,<ref name="Arora"/> the tawny milkcap,<ref name=Mcknight1998/> the orange-brown milky,<ref name=Russell2006/> the voluminous-latex milky,<ref name=Bessette2006/> the lactarius orange,<ref name=Lawlor1993/> the fishy milkcap,<ref name="urlGhent University"/> and the apricot milk cap. In the [[West Virginia]]n mountains of the United States, the mushroom is called a "leatherback" or a "bradley". The latter name may originate from its German name ''Brätling''.<ref name=Ternes2005/><ref name="Bessette2009p.5">Bessette ''et al''. (2009), p. 5.</ref>

''Lactifluus volemus'' was the [[type species]] of the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Dulces'' in [[subgenus]] ''Lactarius'', and is currently classified in ''Lactifluus'' section ''Lactifluus''.<ref name="Verbeken 2012"/> The group around this ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' includes species with a dry cap, abundant latex, and a white or pale cream [[spore print]].<ref name=Singer1986/> Because the closely related ''L.&nbsp;corrugis'' has overlapping [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characters, including similar colouration in the cap and stem, it has been difficult to reliably distinguish between the two species. The difficulty in discerning the two is exacerbated by the fact that both species have several colour forms: Japanese specimens of ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' may have a red cap, a yellow cap with a long stem, or a velvet-like surface texture; the caps of ''L.&nbsp;corrugis'' may be either red, commonly [[rust (color)|rust]]-coloured. In 2005, Japanese researchers clarified the relationships between these two species and others in section ''Dulces'' using [[molecular phylogenetics]], and by comparing differences in [[fatty acid]] composition, [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], and taste. The colour variants group [[phylogenetically]] into different [[clade|subclades]], suggesting that they might better be considered as "different species, subspecies, or varieties".<ref name=Shimono2007/> A 2010 molecular study of ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' of northern Thailand found that 79 tested specimens could be divided into 18 distinct phylogenetic species; six of these were described as new species: ''[[Lactifluus acicularis]]'', ''[[Lactarius crocatus|L.&nbsp;crocatus]]'', ''[[Lactarius distantifolius|L.&nbsp;distantifolius]]'', ''[[Lactarius longipilus|L.&nbsp;longipilus]]'', ''[[Lactarius pinguis|L.&nbsp;pinguis]]'' and ''[[Lactarius vitellinus|L.&nbsp;vitellinus]]''.<ref name=VandePutte2010/>

==Description==

The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' has a fleshy and firm [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] with a velvety or smooth surface and a shape that changes with maturity: it starts off convex, with edges curved inwards, then later grows flat with a depression in the middle. With a typical diameter of 5 to 11&nbsp;cm (2–{{frac|4|1|2}}&nbsp;in), its colour ranges from apricot to [[tawny (color)|tawny]].<ref name="Phillips"/> The cap colouration, however, is somewhat variable, as has been noted in Asian,<ref name=Wang2007/> European,<ref name=Hellman-Clausen1998/> and North American specimens.<ref name=Smith1979/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], whose height varies between 4 and 12&nbsp;cm ({{frac|1|1|2}} and 5&nbsp;in), and which is typically between {{convert|1|and|1.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick, has a slightly lighter colouration than the cap. It is firm, with a velvety or smooth surface that sometimes has depressions running longitudinally up and down its length.



The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[adnation|adnate]] to slightly [[decurrent]], brittle, narrow, quite closely spaced and sometimes forked. Normally a pale golden yellow colour, the gills turn brown when bruised. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae, short gills that do not extend to the stem. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish and firm. The mushroom smells somewhat fishy;<ref name="Phillips"/> one source suggests the odour is "like a dead [[shad]], which anglers will tell you is probably the most malodorous freshwater fish".<ref name="url Kuo"/> The odour is concentrated when the fruit bodies are dried. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the abundant [[latex]], so plentiful that a small nick on the gills will cause it to "weep" the milky substance.<ref name="Arora"/> The latex tends to impart brown stains on whatever it contacts.<ref name="url Kuo"/>

===Micromorphology===


The [[spore print]] is whitish. The [[spore]]s are roughly spherical, translucent ([[hyaline]]), and typically measure 7.5–10.0 by 7.5–9.0&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Bessette2009p.264-66"/> The spore surface is [[wikt:reticulate|reticulate]]—covered with ridges that form a complete network. The ridges are up to 0.8&nbsp;μm high and have conspicuous projections up to 1.2&nbsp;μm high. The spore-bearing cells of the [[hymenium]], the [[basidia]], are club-shaped, hyaline, four-spored, and have dimensions of 40–62 by 7.2–10.4&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Montoya1996/> Interspersed among the basidia are sterile cells called [[cystidia]]. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the side of a gill) are roughly spindle- to club-shaped, and measure 48–145 by 5–13&nbsp;μm. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the edge of a gill) may be spindle-, club-, or awl-shaped ([[wikt:subulate|subulate]]), or intermediate in between these forms, and measure 27–60 by 5–7&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Smith1979/> Additionally, there are cystidia present on both the surface of the cap and the stem.<ref name="Phillips"/> If a drop of [[Iron(II) sulfate|ferric sulphate]] (used as a [[Chemical Tests used in Mushroom Identification#Iron salts|chemical test in mushroom identification]]) is applied to the mushroom flesh, it will immediately stain dark bluish-green.<ref name="Bessette2009p.264-66">Bessette ''et al''. (2009), pp. 264–66.</ref>

===Varieties===
The variety ''Lactifluus volemus'' var. ''flavus'' was described by [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] in their 1979 [[monograph]] of North American ''Lactarius'' species.<ref name=Smith1979/> This rare variety, found in the southeastern United States (ranging from [[South Carolina]] to [[Florida]] and extending west to [[Texas]]), has a cap that stays yellow throughout its development. It also has slightly smaller spores than the regular variety: 6.5–9.0 by 6–8&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Bessette2009p.264-66"/> It is also a good edible.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |orig-year=2005 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=107}}</ref> Some authors have considered the rarely collected ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' var. ''oedematopus'', found in central and southern Europe, to be a distinct variety distinguished from the common variety by a darker reddish-brown cap and a swollen stem. This assessment is not universally accepted, possibly because it falls within the range of morphological variation shown by the main variety.<ref name=Lalli1992/>  ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' var. ''asiaticus'' was named in 2004 based on Vietnamese specimens; associating with [[Khasi Pine|Khasi pine]] (''Pinus khasya''), it has small, dull brown, velvety fruit bodies.<ref name=Doerfelt2004/> In general, little taxonomical significance has been ascribed to the several varieties of ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' that have been proposed.<ref name=VandePutte2010/>

''Lactifluus volemus'' is closely related to ''L.&nbsp;corrugis'', and generally similar in appearance. ''L.&nbsp;corrugis'' usually has more surface wrinkles, darker gills, weaker or absent scent, and less orange colouration; however, intermediate colour forms can be found.<ref name="Roody"/> The two can be distinguished more definitively by microscopic characteristics: ''L.&nbsp;corrugis'' has larger spores—typically 10.4–12.8 by 9.6–11.8&nbsp;μm—with a coarser surface reticulum, and larger pleurocystidia.<ref name=Montoya1996/> The species ''[[Lactarius austrovolemus|Lactifluus austrovolemus]]'' is closely related, but has more crowded gills, while ''[[Lactarius lamprocystidiatus|L.&nbsp;lamprocystidiatus]]'' can only be reliably distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' by microscopic characteristics: the reticulations on its spores are taller and more acute, and the meshes formed by the intersections of the reticulations are smaller.<ref name=Wang2007/> Both ''L.&nbsp;austrovolemus''<ref name=Hongo1973/> and ''L.&nbsp;lamprocystidiatus''<ref name=Verbeken2000/> are known only from [[Papua New Guinea]]. ''[[Lactifluus hygrophoroides]]'' also resembles ''L.&nbsp;volemus'', but differs in having widely spaced gills, and spores that lack surface reticulations.<ref name=Pegler1979/>

Some species of the genus ''Lactarius'' are also similar: The tropical African ''[[Lactarius chromospermus]]'' has a superficial resemblance to ''L.&nbsp;volemus'', but the former species, in addition to its African distribution, can be identified by its cinnamon-brown spore print—unique in the [[Russulaceae]].<ref name=Pegler1982/> ''[[Lactarius subvelutinus]]'' is also similar, but lacks the fishy odour, has a dull yellow-orange to bright golden orange cap, narrow gills, and a white latex that does not change colour.<ref name="Bessette2009p.264-66"/>

== Habitat and distribution ==
, found in Bovec basin, East [[Julian Alps]], [[Slovenia]]]]

Like all milk caps,<ref>Bessette ''et al''. (2009), p. 4.</ref> ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' forms [[ectomycorrhiza]]e, mutually beneficial [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] associations with various tree species. In this association, the fungal [[hypha]]e grow around the [[root]] of the plant and between its [[cortex (botany)|cortical]] cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward into the soil, increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients from the soil. It is found growing at the base of both [[conifer]]ous and [[broad-leaved]] trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in [[peat moss]] beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common.<ref name="Smith1979" /> They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in warm and humid weather.<ref name="Metzler" />

''Lactifluus volemus'' is found in warm [[temperate]] regions and as well as some subtropical and tropical regions of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. The fungus is widely distributed throughout Europe,<ref name="Shimono2007" /> although it is in decline in some countries, and has become rare enough in the Netherlands (and [[Flanders]]) to be considered [[local extinction|locally extinct]].<ref name="urlGhent University" /> It is known from Asia, including China ([[Qinling Mountains]],<ref name="Shen2009" /> [[Guizhou Province]],<ref name="Wang2007" /> and [[Yunnan Province]]),<ref name="Wang2000" /> Japan, India,<ref name="Saini1993" /> Korea,<ref name="Jeune-Chung1987" /> [[Nepal]],<ref name="Christensen2008" /> and Vietnam.<ref name="Doerfelt2004" /> Collections have also been made from the Middle East, including Iran<ref name="Saber1989" /> and Turkey.<ref name="Colak2009" /> In North America, it can be found in southeast Canada,<ref name="Smith1977" /> on the East Coast of the United States<ref name="Arora" /> and Mexico, and in Central America ([[Guatemala]]).<ref name="Montoya1996" />

== Ecology ==
The fruit bodies can be inhabited by species of [[Limoniidae|limoniid]] flies, such as ''[[Discobola marginata]]'' or ''[[Limonia yakushimensis]]'', as well as several species of fungi-dwelling [[mite]]s. The flies are hosts for the mites in a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] association known as ''phoresis'', whereby the mites are mechanically carried by its host. Mites are small and unable to migrate the relatively long distances between mushrooms without assistance; the insect hosts, in comparison, are large and can transfer the mites between their preferred feeding habitats.<ref name="Sueyoshi2007" />

Despite the unappealing fishy scent that develops after the mushroom is picked,<ref name="Smith"/> ''Lactifluus&nbsp;volemus'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]] and recommended for culinary usage, though, typical of milk caps, it has a slightly granular texture that some may find unappetizing.<ref name="Arora"/> The odor disappears during cooking.<ref name=Kuo2007/> The latex only has a mild taste.<ref name="Phillips"/> The species is considered good for novice mushroom hunters to eat,<ref name="Metzler"/> and is best prepared by slow cooking to prevent it from becoming too hard;<ref name="Smith"/> specimens that have been rehydrated after having been dried will require longer cooking times to eliminate the grainy texture.<ref name=Kuo2007/> The mushroom has also been suggested for use in [[casserole]]s and thick sauces.<ref name=Bessette1992/> [[Pan frying]] is not a recommended cooking technique, due to the large amounts of latex it exudes.<ref name="Smith"/> The species has been found to be a good source of [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] and [[carbohydrate]]s.<ref name="Colak2009" />

''L.&nbsp;volemus'' is one of several species of milk caps sold in [[farmer's market|rural markets]] in [[Yunnan Province]], China,<ref name="Wang2000" /> and it is among the most popular wild edible mushrooms collected for consumption and sale in Nepal.<ref name="Christensen2008" /> In their 2009 book on milk caps of North America, Bessette and colleagues consider the mushroom "the best-known and most popular edible milk mushroom" in the eastern U.S.<ref name="Bessette2009p.5" />

Two elderly people developed a transient pancreatitis after consuming ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' in central [[Anatolia]] in Turkey. Both had eaten the mushroom, which they knew as ''Tirmit'', many times before. The condition resolved spontaneously.<ref>{{cite journal | journal=J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep | volume=4| issue=1| pages=232470961562747| year= 2016 |title=Acute Pancreatitis Caused By Mushroom Poisoning | vauthors=Karahan S, Erden A, Cetinkaya A, Avci D, Irfan A, Karagoz H, Bulut K, Basak M| doi=10.1177/2324709615627474| pmid=26835473| pmc=4724762}}</ref>

===Bioactive compounds===


Fruit bodies contains a unique [[sterol]] molecule called volemolide, a [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of the common fungal sterol [[ergosterol]] that may have application in fungal [[chemotaxonomy]].<ref name=Kobata1994/> A 2001 study identified a further nine sterols, three of which were previously unknown to science. According to the authors, these types of highly [[oxygen]]ated compounds—similar to sterols found in marine [[Octocorallia|soft coral]] and [[sponge]]s—are rare in fungi.<ref name=Yue2001/> The mushroom also contains [[volemitol]] (D-glycero-D-mannoheptitol), a seven-carbon [[sugar alcohol]] first isolated from the species by the French scientist [[Émile Bourquelot]] in 1889.<ref name=Bourquelot1889/> Volemitol occurs as a [[monosaccharide|free sugar]] in many plant and [[brown alga]]l species.<ref name=Sivakumar2005/>

Due to their natural [[polyisoprene]] content (1.1–7.7% by [[Dry matter|dry weight]] of fruit bodies),<ref name=Tanaka1994/> ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' fruit bodies can also be used to produce [[rubber]].<ref name=Litvinov2002/> The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high [[molecular mass]] homologue of [[polyprenol]], arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two ''trans'' [[isoprene]] units, a long sequence of ''cis'' isoprenes (between 260 and 300 units), terminated by a [[hydroxyl]] or [[fatty acid ester]].<ref name=Tanaka1995/> [[Biosynthesis|Biosynthetically]], the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound ''trans'',''trans''-[[farnesyl pyrophosphate]], and is thought to terminate by [[ester]]ification of [[polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate]].<ref name=Tanaka1994/> The enzyme [[isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase]] has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in ''L.&nbsp;volemus'' and several other milk cap species.<ref name=Ohya1997/>
