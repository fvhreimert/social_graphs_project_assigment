'''''Pluteus nevadensis''''' is a species of  [[fungus]] in the [[agaric]] family [[Pluteaceae]]. Described as new to science in 2010, the species is known only from [[subtropical]] and [[pine]] forests in Mexico, where it grows on rotting pine and [[oak]] wood. [[Basidiocarp|Fruit bodies]] (mushrooms) have red-orange [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|3.8|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter with a shape ranging from conic, convex, or flattened, depending on their age. The silky yellow [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]s are up to {{convert|4.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long. It is similar in appearance to ''[[Pluteus aurantiorugosus]]'', with which it shares an orange- or scarlet-colored cap and a yellow stem. ''P.&nbsp;nevadensis'' can be distinguished from this and other superficially similar ''[[Pluteus]]'' species by differences in microscopic characteristics.

==Taxonomy==
The species was [[species description|described]] by Olivia Rodríguez in 2010 in the journal ''[[Mycotaxon]]'', based on collections made in 1991. The [[holotype]] material was collected on the [[Nevado de Colima|Colima volcano]], in the Municipality of [[Zapotlán el Grande]], at an elevation of {{convert|2100|m|abbr=on}}.  The species was formerly referred to ''Pluteus aurantiorugosus'',<ref name="Cifuentes 1989"/><ref name="Rodriguez 2001"/> with which it bears a close resemblance. After close examination and comparison of the two species, the authors concluded that the differences in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] and [[DNA sequence]] were sufficient to warrant describing a new species.<ref name="Rodriguez 2010"/>

According to [[Rolf Singer]]'s infrageneric [[classification (biology)|classification]] of the genus ''[[Pluteus]]'',<ref name="Singer 1986"/> the fungus belongs in the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Celluloderma''.<ref name="Rodriguez 2010"/> Species in this section have [[cystidia|pleurocystidia]] that are either absent or non-[[wikt:metuloid|metuloid]]. Furthermore, the majority have a [[cap cuticle]] comprising short club-shaped or spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem) cells, that may or may not be mixed with elongated cystidia-like cells.<ref name="Justo 2011"/> Other species in ''Celluloderma'' include ''[[Pluteus romellii|P.&nbsp;romellii]]'', ''[[Pluteus aurantiorugosus|P.&nbsp;aurantiorugosus]]'', ''[[Pluteus pulverulentus|P.&nbsp;pulverulentus]]'', ''[[Pluteus thompsonii|P.&nbsp;thompsonii]]'', and ''[[Pluteus horakianus|P.&nbsp;horakianus]]''. [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analyses of [[internal transcribed spacer]] DNA sequences supports the placement of ''P.&nbsp;nevadensis'' in ''Celluloderma'', and further suggest that it has a [[sister taxon|sister]] relationship with ''P.&nbsp;horakianas''. The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''nevadensis'' refers to the mountain, [[Nevado de Colima]], where the [[type (biology)|type]] material was collected.<ref name="Rodriguez 2010"/>

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|15|–|38|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, conic when young, bell-shaped to convex or [[wikt:plano-convex|plano-convex]] when mature, and [[umbo (mycology)|umbonate]]. The cap margin is curved downward, even or slightly eroded. The red-orange cap surface is dry to moist, and wrinkled towards the margin but smooths out as it approaches the center. Sometimes there is white-yellowish [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] underneath the [[cap cuticle]]. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], crowded closely together, broad to swollen in the middle, and white or whitish when young to salmon-pinkish in age. The edge of the gill is floccose (with wool-like tufts) or fringed, and whitish. The stem, which is centrally attached to the cap, measures {{convert|6|–|45|mm|in|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|–|6|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, and is roughly equal in width throughout. It is smooth to slightly fibrillose (covered in small slender fibers or filaments), silky, and hollow. The color is yellow or yellowish near the top, and deep orange or with orange tinges towards the base. The base of the stem is covered with cottony whitish [[mycelia]]. The flesh of the cap is 1&nbsp;mm thick or more at the center and whitish. The stem tissue is yellowish or yellow gold. Fruit bodies of ''Pluteus nevadensis'' have no distinctive taste or odor.<ref name="Rodriguez 2010"/>

The color of the [[spore print]] is pinkish-brown. The smooth [[spore]]s measure 5.5–7 by 4.5–6.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], roughly spherical to broadly ellipsoid in shape. Their walls are thin to slightly thickened, and almost translucent. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are 22–29 by 6.5–7.5&nbsp;μm (including [[sterigmata]]), club-shaped, and four-spored. They have [[wikt:refringent|refringent]] contents and are [[hyaline]] (translucent). The pleurocystidia ([[cystidia]] on the gill face) are 41.8–75 by 11.8–24&nbsp;μm, frequent, scattered, and flask-shaped with short or elongated necks. Some pleurocystidia are somewhat [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] (tapered on each end) or somewhat [[wikt:utriform|utriform]] (shaped like a leather bottle or flask), thin-walled, and hyaline. Cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are 32–55 by 10–18.5&nbsp;μm, crowded, and club-shaped. Some are utriform, roughly cylindrical or egg-shaped, thin walled, and hyaline. The gill tissue is convergent, meaning  that the [[hypha]]e appear to converge toward the center of the tissue. The cap cuticle comprises club-shaped or sphaeropedunculate cells that measure 25.6–60 by 13.6–31.2&nbsp;μm. These cells typically have a long [[wikt:pedicel|pedicel]] (stalk) with a thin or slightly thickened wall, and are hyaline. The species lacks oleiferous hyphae (filled with oil-like contents) and [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name="Rodriguez 2010"/>

===Similar species===
''Pluteus aurantiorugosus'' is very similar to ''P.&nbsp;nevadensis'' in external appearance, and the two can only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence. In contrast to the latter species, the former has oblong spores, and cystidia that are shorter and less slender.<ref name="Rodriguez 2010"/> ''P.&nbsp;aurantiorugosus'' is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere, but rare.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/>

The species ''Pluteus horakianus'' shares with ''P.&nbsp;nevadensis'' a fragile fruit body, a red cap, and similar cystidial morphology. It differs in its orange-red gill edges, red stem, and cap cuticle cells that contain pigment. Other species with a roughly similar appearance, including ''[[Pluteus aurantiopustulatus|P.&nbsp;aurantiopustulatus]]'', ''[[Pluteus aurantipes|P.&nbsp;aurantipes]]'', ''[[Pluteus flammipes|P.&nbsp;flammipes]]'', ''[[Pluteus laetifrons|P.&nbsp;laetifrons]]'', and ''[[Pluteus laetus|P.&nbsp;laetus]]'', can be distinguished by differences in microscopic characteristics.<ref name="Rodriguez 2010"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Pluteus nevadensis'' is known only from subtropical and pine forests in the states of [[Guerrero]] and [[Jalisco]], Mexico, where it grows on the rotting wood of pine and [[oak]]. It is one of 34 ''Pluteus'' species known in Mexico.<ref name="Rodriguez 2010"/>
