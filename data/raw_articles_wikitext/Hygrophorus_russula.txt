'''''Hygrophorus russula''''', commonly known as the '''pinkmottle woodwax''', '''false russula''', or '''russula-like waxy cap''',<ref name="Huffman 2008">{{cite book |author=Huffman DM |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tl2fVAHuej4C&pg=PA85 |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of the Midcontinental United States (Bur Oak Guide) |publisher=University of Iowa Press |year=2008 |isbn=9781587297250 |location=Iowa City, Iowa |page=85}}</ref> is a species of fungus native to North America and Europe.

== Taxonomy ==
German naturalist [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] described the species as ''Agaricus russula'' in 1774.<ref name=Schaeffer1774>{{cite book |title=Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu Nascuntur Icones |volume=1 |author=Schaeffer JC. |year=1774 |language=la |page=58 }}</ref> The species name is derived from its reddish coloration, reminiscent of members of the genus ''[[Russula]]''.<ref name=kauffman1918/> French botanist [[Claude Casimir Gillet]] placed it in the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]'' in 1878, before American [[naturalist]] [[Calvin Henry Kauffman]] transferred it to ''[[Hygrophorus]]'' in 1918. Though Kauffman thought it resembled ''Tricholoma'', he held that its waxy gills showed it to be better suited to the genus ''Hygrophorus''.<ref name=kauffman1918>{{cite book | title=	The Agaricaceae of Michigan | series = Publications Mich. geol. biol.
