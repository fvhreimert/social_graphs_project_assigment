'''''Lactarius glyciosmus''''', commonly known as the '''coconut scented milk cap''',<ref name="Jordan"/> is a semi-edible mushroom in the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]''. It is typically coloured a greyish lilac, with the sometimes hollow [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] a little lighter coloured than the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]. It has crowded, decurrent gills, and smells strongly of [[coconut]]s. [[Mycorrhiza]]l, it can be found growing in soil at the base of [[birch]] trees in Europe.

==Taxonomy==
''Lactarius glyciosmus'' was initially described by the Swedish [[mycologist]] [[Elias Magnus Fries]] as ''Agaricus glyciosmus'' in 1818. Its [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''glukos'' "sugar(y)", and ''osmos'' "smell".

==Description==
''Lactarius glyciosmus'' is a small to medium-sized [[agaric]],<ref name="Jordan">{{cite book |title= The Encyclopedia of Fungi of Britain and Europe|last= Jordan|first= Michael|year= 2004|publisher= [[Frances Lincoln]]|isbn= 978-0-7112-2379-0|page= 304|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bFMfytLn3bEC&q=%22Lactarius+glyciosmus%22&pg=PA304}}</ref> which typically has a convex [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] measuring between {{convert|2 and 6|cm|frac=4}},<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |pages=170}}</ref> with a small central depression developing with age. Sometimes there is a central pimple, and the cap is typically coloured a greyish lilac, sometimes varying to a pale buff. It is thin fleshed, with an incurved margin in younger specimens. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] measures between {{Convert|25 and 65|mm|frac=4}} in height, with a width between {{Convert|4 and 12|mm|abbr=on|frac=8}}. The cylindrical stem is typically widest at the bottom becoming narrower towards the top, or sometimes club shaped. The stem is concolorous with the cap, but sometimes is a little paler or with a yellowish hue. The stem is particularly soft and easily broken, and can become hollow. The flesh is buff. The gills are decurrent and crowded, and vary in colour from a pale yellowish to a pale flesh, turning to a greyish lilac with age. The [[latex|milk]] is white with an initially mild, later hot and acrid taste.<ref name="Phillips">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and other fungi of Britain and Europe|last= Phillips|first= Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page= 85}}</ref> The mushroom has a strong smell of [[coconut]]s.<ref name="Jordan"/>

The [[spore print]] is a creamy white colour, and the spores themselves are broadly elliptic in shape, and covered with small warts. The warts are connected by thin ridges in an incomplete network.<ref name="Phillips" /> The spores measure between 8 and 9 by between 5 and 6 [[micrometre]]s.<ref name="Pegler">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Toadstools|last= Pegler|first= David M.|year= 1983|publisher= Mitchell Beazley|isbn= 978-0-85533-500-7|page= 98}}</ref>

=== Similar species ===
It is similar to ''[[Lactarius vietus|L. vietus]]'', the grey milk cap, but is differentiated by the fact ''L.&nbsp;vietus'' milk dries grey, while ''L.&nbsp;glyciosmus'' milk dries white.<ref name="Pegler" /> It can also be confused with ''[[Lactarius cocosiolens|L.&nbsp;cocosiolens]]'', which also smells of coconuts, but ''L.&nbsp;cocosiolens'' has a slimy brown or orange cap and is not found among [[birch]].<ref name="Kuo">{{Cite web|last=Kuo|first=Michael|title=Lactarius glyciosmus|url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/lactarius_glyciosmus.html|access-date=14 January 2009|publisher=MushroomExpert.com}}</ref>
