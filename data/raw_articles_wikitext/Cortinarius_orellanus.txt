'''''Cortinarius orellanus''''', commonly known as the ''' fool's webcap''' or '''fools webcap''', is a species of deadly fungus in the family [[Cortinariaceae]] native to Europe. Within the genus it belongs to a group known as the [[Orellani]], all of which are highly toxic—eating them results in [[kidney failure]], which is often irreversible. The mushroom is generally tan to brown all over.

==Taxonomy==
''Cortinarius orellanus'' was first described by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in his 1838 book ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici seu Synopsis Hymenomycetum''.<ref name="Fries 1838">{{cite book |last=Fries |first=E.

==Description==
''Cortinarius orellanus'' has a concave [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of {{convert|3|to|6|cm|in|frac=4}} diameter, though rare specimens reach {{convert|8|cm|in|frac=4}} across. The cap flattens with age. In colour, it is an orange-brown, and is covered in fine, fibrous scales but become smooth with age. The cap surface turns black with potassium hydroxide. The thick [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are light ochre-coloured, changing to a rust-brown with age as the spores mature. They have an [[Lamella (mycology)#Classification|adnate or sinuate]] connection to the stipe. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|4|to|9|cm|in|frac=4}} tall, and {{convert|1|to|2|cm|in|frac=8}} thick with a tapering base. It is the same colour or slightly paler than the cap, and is yellowish at the top. There are occasionally fragments of the pale yellow veil (cortina) attached to its lower half. The firm [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is pale ochre. It smells slightly of radishes when cut and has no strong taste.<ref name=Bresinsky1989>{{Cite book |last1=Bresinsky |first1=A. |last2=Besl |first2=H. |year=2004 |title=A Colour Atlas of Poisonous Fungi: A Handbook for Pharmacists, Doctors, and Biologists |publisher=CRC Press x |isbn=9780723415763 |pages=53–54 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EIcQGsZ2kksC&pg=PA54}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Cortinarius orellanus'' occurs in central and eastern Europe (Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia), though is rare in Germany. It is occasionally found in southern Britain. It grows in deciduous forests under beech, hornbeam and oak, often near pine trees.<ref name=Bresinsky1989/>

==Toxicity==
The danger of ''C. orellanus'' was uncovered in 1957,<ref name=prast/> after (in 1952) 102 people fell ill after eating it in [[Bydgoszcz]], Poland. Eleven of the victims died.<ref name=Bresinsky1989/><ref name=prast/> Since then, cases of poisoning have been recorded in France, Switzerland, and Germany.<ref name=prast>{{cite journal |last1=Prast |first1=H. |last2=Werner |first2=E.

The relevant toxin is [[orellanine]].<ref name="Jean">{{cite journal |last1=Richard |first1=Jean-Michel |last2=Louis |first2=Josette |last3=Cantin |first3=Danielle |date=1 March 1988 |title=Nephrotoxicity of orellanine, a toxin from the mushroom ''Cortinarius orellanus'' |journal=Archives of Toxicology |issn=0340-5761 |doi=10.1007/BF00570151 |volume=62 |issue=2–3 |pages=242–245 |pmid=3196164 |bibcode=1988ArTox..62..242R |s2cid=36515278 }}</ref>

One important feature of Cortinarius orellanus's natural history is its toxicity, which is linked to the presence of orellanine, a strong nephrotoxin. The research publications provide strong evidence for this claim, especially the one by Judge et al. (2010) that describes cases of chronic renal failure brought on by consumption of orellanine-containing Cortinarius mushrooms.
