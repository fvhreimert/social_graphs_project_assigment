'''''Lactarius fumosus''''', commonly known as the '''smoky milkcap''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Russulaceae]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by American mycologist [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1872.<ref name=Peck1872/> "Lactarius fumosus" [[variety (botany)|var.]] ''fumosus'' is considered a [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonym]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Lactarius fumosus"/>

''Lactarius fumosus'' is the [[type species]] of the [[section (biology)|section]] ''Fumosi'' of the [[subgenus]] ''Plinthogalus'' of the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]''.<ref>Hesler and Smith, 1979, p. 103.</ref>

It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "smoky milkcap".<ref name=Bessette2009/>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|3|–|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide, broadly convex to nearly plane, sometimes shallowly depressed. The margin (cap edge) is irregular, often wavy, and lobed or ribbed. The cap surface is dry, unpolished, azonate, usually becoming somewhat wrinkled with age, pale dingy yellow-brown to whitish overall, with a smoky tinge, sometimes with tawny olive, pinkish buff, or dull brown areas. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached to subdecurrent (running slightly down the length of the stem), narrow, crowded together, whitish, becoming dingy yellow-[[buff (color)|buff]], staining reddish when bruised. The stem is {{convert|4|–|11|cm|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|6|–|15|mm|in|abbr=on}} thick, nearly equal, dry, dull, stuffed, colored like the cap, whitish towards the base, staining reddish, but more slowly than the gills. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is pale white, staining reddish-salmon when cut. Its odor is not distinctive, but the taste is variable: quickly acrid then mild then slowly staining acrid, or very slowly faintly acrid. The [[latex]] is white on exposure, unchanging, staining tissues reddish. The [[spore print]] is pinkish-buff. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] is unknown.<ref name=Bessette2009/>

===Microscopic characters===
The spores are 6–8 by 6–8&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], spherical or nearly so, ornamented with ridges that form a partial reticulum, prominences up to 1.5&nbsp;μm high, [[hyaline]] (translucent), [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]]. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a palisade of cylindrical to club-shaped cells.<ref name=Bessette2009/>

===Similar species===
''[[Lactarius musciola]]'' has darker colors, and its gills do not stain reddish where bruised.<ref name=Bessette2009/> ''[[Lactarius fuliginosus]]'' differs in having broad subdistant gills.<ref name=Guevara1987/>

==Habitat and distribution==
The fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;fumosus'' grow solitary, scattered, or in groups on the ground in woods from July–October. The fungus is widely distributed in eastern North America, and has also been reported from western Canada. Its frequency of occurrence is described as occasional.<ref name=Bessette2009/> Its range extends south to northwestern Mexico, where it is found associated with ''[[Liquidambar]]'', ''[[Magnolia]]'', ''[[Acer (genus)|Acer]]'', and ''[[Quercus]]'' species.<ref name=Guevara1987/>

==Bioactive compounds==
Extracts of the fruit bodies are toxic to the corn earworm, ''[[Heliothis zea]]'' and the large milkweed bug, ''[[Oncopeltus fasciatus]]''. The [[insecticide|insecticidal]] activity is thought to be caused by compounds called [[chromene]]s.<ref name=Dowd1990/>
