'''''Lycoperdon pulcherrimum''''', commonly known as the '''long-spined puffball''',<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/694/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, California |pages=694 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> is a type of [[puffball]] mushroom in the genus ''[[Lycoperdon]]''. It was first [[species description|described]] scientifically in 1873 by [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]].<ref name="Berkeley 1873"/>

The fruit body grows to {{Convert|5|cm|frac=4}} wide and tall.<ref name="Arora1986" /> It is generally pear-shaped. The larger portion forms the top and is covered by whitish spines up to {{Convert|6|mm|frac=8}} long. The stemlike portion is a sterile base which is white in youth, aging to purplish brown; it is often wrinkled.<ref name="Arora1986" /> The [[spore mass]] is initially white and ages to become yellow then dark brownish.<ref name="Arora1986" /> It can resemble a number of other species in the genus.<ref name="Arora1986" />

The fungus is found in the southern United States.<ref name="Miller 2006" /> Like many puffballs, it is [[edible]] in youth (when the spore mass is white and firm) but inedible in age.<ref name="Arora1986" /> Also being small and infrequent, it is of little culinary value.<ref name="Arora1986" />
