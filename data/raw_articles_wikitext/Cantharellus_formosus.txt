'''''Cantharellus formosus''''', commonly known as the '''Pacific golden chanterelle''', is a [[fungus]] native to the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of [[North America]]. It is a member of the genus ''[[Cantharellus]]'' along with other popular edible [[chanterelle]]s. It was distinguished from ''[[Cantharellus cibarius|C.&nbsp;cibarius]]'' in the 1990s. It is orange to yellow, meaty and funnel-shaped. On the underside of the smooth cap, it has gill-like ridges that run down onto its stipe, which tapers down from the cap. The false gills often have a pinkish hue. It has a mild, sweet odor.

It appears solitary to gregarious in [[conifer]]ous forests, from July to December. It is a choice [[edible mushroom]] and Oregon's state mushroom.

== Taxonomy ==
[[E. J. H. Corner]] formally described ''C. formosus'' in 1966 from specimens collected on [[Vancouver Island]] in 1938.<ref name="corner66" />  Despite this publication, the name [[Cantharellus cibarius|''C.&nbsp;cibarius'']] (a&nbsp;European species) continued to be used to refer to golden chanterelles in the [[Pacific Northwest]]. In 1997, Redhead et al. {{nowrap|re-examined}} Corner's specimens, returned to the type locale, and collected new specimens, confirming the identity of ''C.&nbsp;formosus''.<ref name="red97" />  [[Molecular phylogenetics|DNA analysis]] has since confirmed the species-level rank of ''C.&nbsp;formosus''.<ref name="mon06" />

== Description ==
[[Basidiocarp|Fruiting bodies]] of ''C. formosus'' range from {{convert|2|-|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide,''<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=96}}</ref>'' with [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] colors varying depending on light levels and weather. In dry weather, the cap is medium orange yellow to light yellow brown, but wet weather may brighten the cap to brilliant to soft orange yellow. In low light conditions, caps may not develop the yellow pigmentation, resulting in salmon to rosy buff colors. The [[hymenium|false gills]] may be yellow, salmon, buff, or even whitish depending on conditions, but are usually paler than the cap. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is colored similarly to the cap, and is either equal-width or tapering downwards. The spore print is a yellowish white color.<ref name="red97" />

=== Similar species ===
Several other species of chanterelle may be found in western North America:<ref name="pnwkey" />
*''[[Cantharellus californicus|C. californicus]]<ref name=":02" />'' – large size, associated with oaks in California
*''[[Cantharellus cascadensis|C. cascadensis]]''<ref name="amm09" /> – bright yellow fading to white in center of cap, may have bulbous base of stem
*''[[Cantharellus cibarius|C. cibarius]]'' var. ''roseocanus'' – brilliant orange-yellow color without pinkish hues, false gills not paler than cap
*''[[Cantharellus subalbidus|C. subalbidus]]'' – whitish overall color<ref name="amm09" />

Additionally, ''[[Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca]]'', ''[[Chroogomphus|Chroogomphus tomentosus]]'', and species in the genera ''[[Craterellus]]'', ''[[Gomphus (fungus)|Gomphus]]'' (namely ''[[Gomphus floccosus|G.&nbsp;floccosus]]'' and ''G.&nbsp;kauffmanii''), ''[[Omphalotus]]'' (particularly the poisonous ''[[Omphalotus olivascens|O.&nbsp;olivascens]]'' in California),<ref name="amm09" /> and ''[[Polyozellus]]'' may have a somewhat similar appearance to ''C.&nbsp;formosus''.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Cantharellus formosus'' has been reported from [[British Columbia]] to [[California]], and is particularly abundant in the [[conifer]] forests of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]]. It forms a [[mycorrhiza]]l association with [[Douglas-fir]] and [[western hemlock]], and has been shown to be more common in younger (40- to 60-year-old) forests than in [[old-growth forest]]s.<ref name="amm09" /><ref name="dun06" /> It grows solitary to gregarious, from July to December.<ref name="ehlers10" />

==Uses==
The mushroom has a mildly sweet odor and a mild taste.<ref name="mexp" /> It should be brushed clean but not washed before cooking. It can be tossed, stir-fried, and sautéed in butter or oil.<ref name=Oregon>{{cite book |last1=Meuninck |first1=Jim |title=Foraging Mushrooms Oregon: Finding, Identifying, and Preparing Edible Wild Mushrooms |date=2017 |publisher=[[Falcon Guides]] |isbn=978-1-4930-2669-2 |page=2}}</ref> Commonly sold in grocery markets and restaurants,<ref name="amm09" /> it is the most important commercially harvested ''Cantharellus'' species in the Pacific Northwest.<ref name="ehlers10" /><ref name="pilz03" />

==In culture==
The species has been designated [[List of Oregon state symbols|Oregon's state mushroom]] due to its economic value and abundance.<ref name="orla" />
