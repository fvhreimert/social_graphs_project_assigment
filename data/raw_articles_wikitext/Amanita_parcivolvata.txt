'''''Amanita parcivolvata''''' also known as '''ringless false fly amanita''',<ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> is a [[fungus]] that produces [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ranging from {{convert|3|–|12|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} in width and height.

==Taxonomy==
This ''Amanita'' is in the subgenus ''Amanita'' and in the section ''Amanita''. It was first described by [[Charles Horton Peck]] in 1900 as ''Amanitopsis parcivolvata''.  [[William Alphonso Murrill|Murrill]] the placed it in the now defunct genus, ''Vaginata, ''in 1910, comparing it to the local specimens of ''[[Amanita vaginata|Vaginata plumbea]]'' in [[Blacksburg, Virginia]] and finding it distinct.<ref>{{cite book |last=New York Botanical Garden |title=''Mycologia, Volume V'' |publisher=Mycological Society of America |year=1913 |editor-last=Murrill |page=83}}</ref> However, it was not formally described in literature until 1913. J.&nbsp;E. Gilbert placed in the genus ''Amanita'' in 1941, where it remained.

==Description==

'''Cap''': The [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] is bright red ranging from  {{convert|3|–|12|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} in diameter with warts which range in color from pale yellow to white. With rain, these can wash off, giving it a somewhat similar appearance to an ''[[Amanita]]'' in ''[[Amanita jacksonii|section Caesareae]]'' from a distance, especially if all but the cap is covered by [[detritus]].

'''Gills''': The [[lamellae (mycology)|lamellae]] are white to pale yellow, closely spaced, free from the stipe, and sometimes with a serrated margin.

'''Stipe''':  {{convert|3|–|12|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} in length and about {{convert|1.5|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=2}} in width, with pale yellow to white powdery volval remnants all along the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]. The volva, if it even may be called that, is rather undeveloped as compared to other members of ''[[Amanita]]''.

'''Microscopic features''': According to Rod Tulloss, the spores of ''Amanita parcivolvata'' measure (8.4-) 9.1-11.5 (-12.6) X (5.6-) 6.3-7.9 (-8.0)&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], are [[inamyloid]], and the [[basidium|basidia]] rarely have [[clamp connection|clamps]] at bases.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.eticomm.net/~ret/species/Amanita/parcivol.html |title= Amanita parcivolvata |last1= Tulloss |first1= Rod |accessdate= December 25, 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

'''Chemical reactions''': With [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]], the red color of the cap quickly fades to an orange, then yellow color.

===Similar species===
It vaguely resembles ''[[Amanita muscaria|A. muscaria]]''. It is differentiated, however, by its lack of an [[annulus (mycology)|annulus]], by the [[volva (mycology)|volval]] deposits on its stipe/base, and by its pileal striations. It occasionally lacks a stipe bulb entirely, instead just tapering to a point in the ground with powdery volval deposits on its surface.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

==Distribution and habitat==
It is occasional to common in the [[Southeastern United States]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Bessette |first=Alan R. |title=Mushrooms of the Southeastern United States |author2=William Roody |author3=Areleen Bessette |author4=Dail Dunway |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8156-3112-5}}</ref> occurring primarily in ''[[Quercus]]'' forests though it has been observed in forests with a mix of [[conifers]] and [[oak]]s.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kuo |first1=Michael |date=March 2008 |title=Amanita parcivolvata |url=http://www.mushroomexpert.com/Amanita_parcivolvata.html |accessdate=December 25, 2011}}</ref>
