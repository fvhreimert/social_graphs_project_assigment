'''''Lactarius sanguifluus''''', commonly known as the '''bloody milk cap''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Russulaceae]]. First described from France in 1811, the species was given its current name by [[Elias Fries]] in 1838 when he transferred it to ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]''. The [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] are orangish to reddish-brown, and become funnel-shaped with age. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are pinkish to purplish.  When bruised or cut, the fruit bodies ooze a blood-red to purple [[latex]] that slowly turns greenish upon exposure to air.

Found in Asia, Mediterranean Africa, and Europe, [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) grow scattered or in groups on the ground under [[conifer]]s, especially [[Douglas-fir]]. Different [[form (botany)|forms]] have been described from Italy, but these are not universally accepted as distinct. ''L.&nbsp;sanguifluus'' mushrooms are [[edible mushroom|edible]], and sold in rural markets of Europe and Asia. Fruit bodies grown in [[soil contamination|polluted soil]], including roadsides subject to heavy traffic, can [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] toxic [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]]. Several [[sterol]]s and [[biological pigment|pigment]] have been isolated and identified from the mushrooms.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was first [[species description|described]] by French mycologist  [[Jean-Jacques Paulet]] as ''[[Hypophyllum]] sanguifluum'' in 1811.<ref name="Paulet 1811"/> It was given its current name by [[Elias Magnus Fries]] when he transferred it to ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'' in his 1838 work ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici''.<ref name="Fries 1838"/> In 1892, [[Otto Kuntze]] called it a ''[[Lactifluus]]'',<ref name="Kuntze 1891"/> a genus that until 2010 was considered a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''Lactarius''.<ref name="Buyck 2010"/> Because Paulet's 1811 [[type (biology)|type]] illustration of the species did not represent the typical [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of the fruit bodies, Jorinde Nuytinck and Annemieke Verbeken designated an [[epitype]] in 2005.<ref name="Nuytinck 2005 pp.153-6"/>

Giovanni Pacioni and Giorgio Lalli described the [[form (botany)|forms]] ''roseus'' and ''vinosus'' from Italy in 2003; ''roseus'' has a greyish-whitish cap discolouration, while f. ''vinosus'' has a less clearly [[zonate]] cap that lacks green tones, and gills with a lilac-pinkish sheen.<ref name="Lalli 2003"/> However, form ''vinosus'', originally described by [[Lucien Quélet]] as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] (''Lactarius sanguifluus'' var. ''vinosus'') in 1881, was [[valid name (botany)|invalid]], because Quélet's [[basionym]] was an illegitimate nomenclatural synonym of a species named in 1855 by [[Jean-Baptiste Barla]].<ref name="urlMycoBank: Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus"/><ref>Nuytinck and Verbeken (2005), [http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0092/0163.htm p. 163.]</ref> Later authors did not agree with the delimitation of these forms as distinct [[taxon|taxa]], suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age, and environmental factors such as levels of sunlight and humidity.<ref name="Nuytinck 2005 pp.153-6"/> ''[[Lactarius vinosus]]'' has often been considered as a [[variety (botany)|variety]] of ''L.&nbsp;sanguifluus'', but morphological (especially macroscopic characters and [[spore]]-ornamentation) and [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] evidence (based on [[internal transcribed spacer]]-sequencing) has confirmed that they are separate species.<ref name="Nuytinck 2003"/>

''Lactarius sanguifluus'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Dapetes'' of the genus ''Lactarius''. This section, which also includes other popular [[edible mushroom|edible]] species such as ''[[Lactarius deliciosus|L.&nbsp;deliciosus]]'', and the less popular ''[[Lactarius deterrimus|L.&nbsp;deterrimus]]'', is characterized by mushrooms with orange or red latex that often impart a greenish stain on the flesh and gills, an often sticky cap, and association with conifers.<ref>Heilmann-Clausen, Verbeken, and Vesterhold (2000), p. 26.</ref> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''sanguifluus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] words ''sanguis'' ("blood") and ''fluus'' ("flowing").<ref name="Rea 1922"/>

==Description==

The fruit bodies have convex [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] with a central depression, reaching a diameter of {{convert|4|–|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The cap surface is smooth and sticky, and the margins are curved downward, even as the mushroom matures. Its color is pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]] to orangish, sometimes with patches of grayish or pale greenish-gray, especially where the surface has been bruised. The somewhat crowded [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] have an [[adnation|adnate]] to slightly [[decurrent]] attachment to the stipe. They are pale [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] with a pale pinkish-buff edge. The cylindrical stipe measures {{convert|2.0|–|3.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|–|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. Its smooth surface is colored pale pinkish-buff to pale greyish-buff, sometimes with brownish irregular dots. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] ranges from firm to fragile: in the stipe, it is soft and pale pinkish buff; under the cap cuticle it is brick colored, or brownish-red just above the gills. Its taste ranges from mild to slightly bitter, and it lacks any significant odor.<ref name="Heilmann-Clausen pp.146-7">Heilmann-Clausen, Verbeken, and Vesterhold (2000), pp.&nbsp;146–7.</ref>

The [[basidiospore|spores]] are roughly spherical to [[ellipsoid]]al, measuring 7.9–9.5 by 8.0–8.8&nbsp;μm. They feature surface ornamentations up to 0.8&nbsp;μm high and an almost complete reticulum comprising broad, rounded ridges. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are somewhat cylindrical, four-spored, and measure 50–70 by 9–11&nbsp;μm. The [[cap cuticle]] is an ixocutis (made of gelatinous [[hypha]]e that run parallel to the cap surface) up to 60&nbsp;μm thick, with hyphae that are 2–6&nbsp;wide that are usually branched and interwoven.<ref name="Heilmann-Clausen pp.146-7"/>

===Similar species===
''Lactarius vinosus'', formerly considered a variety of ''L.&nbsp;sanguifluus'', is quite similar in appearance. In general, ''L.&nbsp;vinosus'' can be distinguished by the more vinaceous-red color (lacking orange tones) of its cap, stipe, and gills, the more distinctly downwards-tapered stipe, and the more intense staining of the latex on the cap tissue. The two species can also be distinguished microscopically by differences in the ornamentation of their spore surfaces. ''L.&nbsp;vinosus'' has an incomplete reticulum on the spore surface, with ridges that have a wider degree of variation in thickness.<ref>Nuytinck and Verbeken (2005), [http://www.cybertruffle.org.uk/cyberliber/59575/0092/0162.htm pp. 162–3.]</ref> Another potential lookalike, ''[[Lactarius semisanguifluus|L.&nbsp;semisanguifluus]]'', has a characteristic orange latex that turns wine-red in 5–10 minutes after exposure to air. Compared to ''L.&nbsp;sanguifluus'', the fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;semisanguifluus'' are smaller, have tinges of violet in the cap, and develop a greenish discolouration with age.<ref>Heilmann-Clausen, Verbeken, and Vesterholt (2000), p. 149.</ref>

==Habitat and distribution==

An [[ectomycorrhiza]]l species, ''Lactarius sanguifluus'' fruit bodies grow on the ground in association with [[pine]] trees on [[calcareous]] soils. ''L.&nbsp;sanguifluus'' is widely distributed in [[Himachal Pradesh]] in India, where it has been noted to grow in mixed [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forests]], usually under the fern ''[[Onychium contiguum]]''.<ref name="Lakhanpal 1987"/> It is widespread in Southern Europe, where it fruits between September and November (extending to December in the southernmost regions of the continent).<ref name="Nuytinck 2005 pp.153-6"/> In the Netherlands, it was found in calcareous dunes, growing in a warm, sunny and sheltered place at the edge of a woods dominated in pine species.<ref name="Jalink 1997"/> From Europe, it has also been recorded in Belgium,<ref name="Verbeken 1998"/> Estonia,<ref name="Nuytinck 2005 p.273">Nuytinck, Verbeken, and Vesterholt (2000), p. 273.</ref> Greece,<ref name="Kalogeropoulos 2013"/> Cyprus, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia,<ref name="Nuytinck 2005 p.273"/> Spain, Slovakia, Sweden,<ref name="Nuytinck 2005 pp.153-6"/> and Switzerland.<ref>Nuytinck, Verbeken, and Vesterholt (2000), p. 261.</ref> In Africa, the species has been collected in Morocco;<ref name="Nuytinck 2005 pp.153-6"/> in Asia, it occurs in Vietnam<ref name="Dorfelt 2004"/> and China.<ref name="Wang 2000"/> It is listed in the [[Regional Red List|Red Data Book]] of Ukraine,<ref name="Sarkina 2003"/> and appeared in a draft red list for Spain as an endangered edible species considered vulnerable due to uncontrolled commercial picking. To illustrate, a September 1998 newspaper report was cited, which reported that {{convert|82.5|kg|abbr=on}} of ''L.&nbsp;sanguifluus'' mushrooms picked in [[Poligny, Jura|Poligny]] were seized from a van.<ref name="Council of Europe"/>

===Edibility===

The fruit bodies are [[edible mushroom|edible]] and choice. This was noted by Paulet in his original description of the species, who wrote: "This fungus is highly prized for use by those who are acquainted with it, it keeps well: I kept them for a whole year, it hardens without spoiling, then it takes on a taste of morels. The best way to eat is to cook it in the frying pan or on the grill with oil or butter & salt: it does not take long to cook".<ref name="Paulet 1811"/> The mushrooms are sold in rural markets in France,<ref name="Biswas 2012"/> Spain,<ref>Dugan (2011), p. 44.</ref> Turkey,<ref>Dugan (2011), p. 60.</ref> and [[Yunnan Province]], China.<ref name="Wang 2000"/> They are also collected by locals in the upper valley of the [[Serchio River]] in central Italy.<ref>Dugan (2011), p. 41.</ref> In Spain, where the mushroom is esteemed as a culinary delicacy in [[Catalan cuisine]],<ref name="Font 2003"/> it is known as ''níscalos''<ref name="Mendel 2008"/> (in Spanish) or ''rovelló''<ref name="Andrews 2005"/> (in Catalan). In Cyprus, it is known as ''γαιματάς'' (meaning "the bloody one") and it is widely collected by the locals, but considered inferior to the saffron milk cap (''[[Lactarius deliciosus]]'').<ref>Loizides M, Kyriakou T, Tziakouris A. (2011). Edible & Toxic Fungi of Cyprus (in Greek and English). Published by the authors. pp. 188–89. {{ISBN|978-9963-7380-0-7}}.</ref> In India, young specimens are consumed along with ''L.&nbsp;deliciosus'';<ref name="Lakhanpal 1987"/> and some consider ''L.&nbsp;sanguifluus'' to have a better flavor than its more well-known relative.<ref name="Andrews 2005"/> Its English [[common name]] is the "bloody milkcap".<ref name="BMS Common names"/>

Fruit bodies can [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], including toxic ones, from [[soil contamination|polluted soil]]. For this reason, consuming mushrooms harvested from potentially contaminated sites—such as near roadsides subject to heavy traffic—is not recommended.<ref name="Işıloğlu 2001"/> In a Turkish study of various edible mushroom species collected from lawns, near roads, and the inner parts of forests, the fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;sanguifluus'' were determined to have accumulated high levels of [[zinc]], [[manganese]], [[nickel]], [[cobalt]], [[cadmium]], and [[lead]].<ref name="Işıloğlu 2001"/>

==Bioactive compounds==
''Lactarius sanguifluus'' contains a mixture of [[sterol]]s. The predominant sterol is [[ergosterol]] (56.6% of total sterols), with lesser amounts of ergosterol [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]], including ergost-7-en-3β-ol, ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol, and ergosta-5,7-dien-3β-ol.<ref name="Cerri 1981"/>

The latex contains [[sesquiterpene]] [[biological pigment|pigments]] with [[guaiane skeleton]]s;<ref name="DeRosa 1986"/> these include the compounds given the common names lactaroviolin and sangol. Some of these chemicals are thought to undergo [[enzyme|enzymatic]] conversions when the fruit body becomes injured.<ref name="Sterner 1988"/> Fruit body extracts have been shown to have some [[antimicrobial]] activity against [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] and Gram-negative bacteria.<ref name="Dulger 2002"/>
