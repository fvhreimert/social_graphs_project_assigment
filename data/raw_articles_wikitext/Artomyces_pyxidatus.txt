'''''Artomyces pyxidatus''''' is a [[Coral fungi|coral fungus]] that is commonly called '''crown coral''' or '''crown-tipped coral fungus'''. Its most characteristic feature is the crown-like shape of the tips of its branches. The [[botanical name|epithet]] ''pyxidatus'' means "box-like"—a reference to this shape.<ref name="Henrici 2012"/>

== Description ==
The hard, coral-like fruiting bodies reach {{Convert|4-10|cm|frac=2}} tall.<ref name="audu" /> The colour ranges from cream to semi-tan.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=250–251|language=en}}</ref> The branches rise in ringlike arrangements resembling a crown.<ref name=":0" /> [[Basidia]] and basidiospores are produced on the surfaces of the branches. The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name="audu" />

The [[sesquiterpene]] compounds pyxidatols A-C, tsuicoline&nbsp;E and omphadiol have been obtained from the liquid culture of this fungus.<ref name="Zheng 2008" />

DNA evidence and microscopy indicates that the species is closely related to members of the genera ''[[Russula]]'' and ''[[Lentinellus]]'', as well as ''[[Auriscalpium vulgare]]''.<ref name=":0" /> ''[[Artomyces piperatus]]'' is found on the North American West Coast.<ref name="audu" /> Other similar species include ''Clavulina avellanea'', ''[[Clavulina cristata|C.&nbsp;cristata]]'', ''C.&nbsp;divaricata'', ''C.&nbsp;piperata'', and ''C.&nbsp;taxophila''.<ref name=":0" /> Additionally, ''[[Ramaria stricta]]'' is similar but lacks crown-like tips.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=129, 152}}</ref>

== Distribution and habitat ==
In eastern North America, ''A. pyxidatus'' appears on decaying wood from June to September.<ref name="audu" /> It can be observed throughout [[Northern Canada]] during the growing season. In Britain, it was recorded in 2011, almost 116 years after its previous reliable report, a collection made by mycologist [[Carleton Reale]] on 20 October 1886. Two subsequent records have been provided in Britain since 2011; one by Yvonne Davidson in Kent in 2018, and one by Cameron Ambler in East Sussex in 2021.
