'''''Typhula quisquiliaris''''', [[common name|commonly known]] as the '''bracken club''', is a species of [[club fungi|club fungus]] in the family [[Typhulaceae]]. It produces small, white [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] up to {{convert|9|mm|in|sigfig=1}} in height, each with a single distinct "head" and "stem". The head is fertile, while the stem attaches to a [[sclerotium]] embedded in the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The fruit bodies grow from dead wood, and strongly favours [[bracken]], where the species feeds [[saprotrophically]]. Though ''T.&nbsp;quisquiliaris'' was described under a different name by [[James Sowerby]] in 1803, the [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''quisquiliaris'' was [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] in 1821 by [[Elias Magnus Fries]], and the species was moved to the genus ''[[Typhula]]'', which resulted in its currently accepted [[binomial name]] by [[Paul Christoph Hennings]] in 1896. The species has been recorded in Europe and north Africa.

==Taxonomy==
''Typhula quisquiliaris'' was first described by [[James Sowerby]] in 1803 as ''[[Clavaria]] obtusa''. However, this name was found to be illegitimate,<ref name="Mycobank"/> as it had already been given to a different species by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] in 1797.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mycobank.org/MycoTaxo.aspx?Link=T&Rec=240327|title= ''Clavaria obtusa'' Pers. 1797|publisher= [[MycoBank]]. International Mycological Association|access-date=2 August 2011}}</ref> The species was given its [[sanctioned name]] several years later by [[Elias Magnus Fries]], in his 1821 ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]''. Fries named the species ''[[Pistillaria]] quisquiliaris'', having previously (in 1818) named it ''Clavaria quisquiliaris''.<ref name="Mycobank"/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''quisquiliaris'' is from the Latin meaning "pertaining to refuse".<ref name="Rea"/><ref name=Latin>{{cite book|last=Andrews|first=Ethan Allen|title=A Copious and Critical Latin-English Lexicon|year=1876|publisher=Harper & Bros|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNkEAQAAIAAJ|author2=Freund, William |access-date=2 August 2011|page=1259|quote=quisquiliae, arum ... The waste or refuse of any thing, the droppings of trees, sweepings, offscourings, rubbish, filth}}</ref> In the same year, [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] reclassified Sowerby's ''Clavaria obtusa'', naming it ''Geoglossum obtusum''. Fries's name was taken up as the valid one, however, and in 1896, [[Paul Christoph Hennings]] transferred the species to ''[[Typhula]]'', giving the species the name by which it is known today.<ref name="Mycobank"/> However, the name ''Pistillaria quisquiliaris'' was sometimes used into the 20th century. For instance, [[Carleton Rea]] used it in a 1922 publication.<ref name="Rea">{{cite book |title=British Basidiomycetaceae: a Handbook to the Larger British Fungi |author=Rea, Carleton |author-link=Carleton Rea |year=1922 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |page=205 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/17128558}}</ref> The species is [[common name|commonly known]] as the bracken club.<ref name="Sterry"/>

''Typhula quisquiliaris'' produces [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] in the form of [[Clavarioid fungi|clubs]]. Each fruit body consists of a single distinct "stem" and "head",<ref name="Sterry"/> and measures up to {{convert|7|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in height.<ref name="Ellis">{{cite book |title= Fungi without Gills (Hymenomycetes and Gasteromycetes): An Identification Handbook|author1=Ellis, Martin Beazor |author2=Ellis, J. Pamela |year= 1990|publisher= [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn= 978-0-412-36970-4|pages= 211–2}}</ref> The surface of the head is smooth and white,<ref name="Sterry"/> and measures  {{convert|1.5|to|4|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} by {{convert|1|to|2.5|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. The rounded stem is [[Sterility (physiology)|infertile]], and of a similar colour to the head. However, it has a very fine [[wiktionary:downy|downy]] covering, and is somewhat translucent. The stem measures from {{convert|0.3|to|0.4|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} in width. The stem attaches to [[sclerotium]] which is buried into the branch from which the fruit body grows.<ref name="Sterry">{{cite book |title= Complete Guide to British Mushrooms & Toadstools|author1=Sterry, Paul |author2=Hughes, Barry |year= 2009|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|isbn= 978-0-00-723224-6|page= 242}}</ref>

===Microscopic characteristics===
''Typhula quisquiliaris'' spores are narrowly [[ellipsoid]], and measure from 9 to 14 by 4 to 5.5 [[micrometre]]s (μm).<ref name="Ellis"/> The spores are white, and contain small [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]].<ref name="Rea"/> The spores are borne on [[basidia]] which measure 50 to 70 by 7 to 8 μm, with four spores on each basidium. The downy covering of the stem is made up of thick-walled hairs, each measuring 15 to 60 by 3 to 7 μm, though they are often swollen towards the base. The sclerotium measures from 1.5 to 3 by 0.5 μm, and is a pale yellow colour. [[Clamp connections]] are present in the [[hyphae]].<ref name="Ellis"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Typhula quisquiliaris'' fruit bodies are typically found in rows, growing from plant [[detritus]].<ref name="Sterry"/> The species favours [[bracken]],<ref name="Ellis"/> especially ''[[Pteridium aquilinum]]'',<ref name="Ellis"/> but the colonisation of dead matter from other plants is not unknown.<ref name="Sterry"/> Upon these substrates, it feeds as a [[saprotroph]], breaking down the dead organic matter in order to sustain itself.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} The species has been recorded in Europe<ref name="Sterry"/> and northern Africa.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} In Europe, the fruit bodies can be encountered from April to December.<ref name="Rea"/>
