'''''Rubroboletus satanas''''', commonly known as '''Satan's bolete''' or the '''Devil's bolete''', is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus of the [[Boletaceae|bolete family]] ([[Boletaceae]]) and one of its most infamous members. It was known as '''''Boletus satanas''''' before its transfer to the new genus ''[[Rubroboletus]]'' in 2014, based on molecular [[phylogenetic]] data.

These squat, brightly coloured fruiting bodies are often massive and imposing, with a beige-coloured velvet-textured cap up to {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}} across, yellow to orange-red pores and a bulbous red stem. The flesh turns blue when cut or bruised and the fruit bodies often emit an unpleasant rotten odor.

Found in [[broad-leaved]] and mixed woodland in the warmer regions of Europe, it is classified as a [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous mushroom]], known to cause violent [[gastroenteritis]]. However, reports of poisoning are rare, due to the striking coloration and unpleasant odor of the fruiting bodies, which discourage experimentation.

==Taxonomy==
Originally known as ''Boletus satanas'', Satan's bolete was described by German mycologist Harald Othmar Lenz in 1831. Lenz was aware of several reports of adverse reactions from people who had consumed this fungus and apparently felt himself ill from its "emanations" while describing it, hence giving it its sinister epithet.<ref name = "Ramsbottom53">{{cite book | author = Ramsbottom J | year = 1953 | title = Mushrooms & Toadstools |pages=53–54 | publisher = Collins | isbn = 1-870630-09-2}}</ref> The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|σατανᾶς}} (''satanas'', or [[Satan]]) is derived from [[Hebrew]] ''śāṭān'' (שטן).<ref name=Nilper/> The American mycologist [[Harry D. Thiers]] concluded that material from North America matches the species description;<ref name=Thiers75>{{cite book |title=California Mushrooms &ndash; A Field Guide to the Boletes |author=Thiers HD |year=1975 |publisher=Hafner Press |location=New York |isbn=0-02-853410-7 |page=58}}</ref> however, [[genetic testing]] has since confirmed that western North American collections represent ''[[Rubroboletus eastwoodiae]]'', a different species.

Genetic analysis published in 2013 revealed that ''B.&nbsp;satanas'' and several other red-pored boletes are part of the "dupainii" clade (named after ''[[Rubroboletus dupainii|B.&nbsp;dupainii]]'') and are distantly nested from the core group of ''[[Boletus]]'' (including ''[[Boletus edulis|B. edulis]]'' and relatives) within the [[Boletineae]]. This indicated that ''B.&nbsp;satanas'' and its relatives belonged to a distinct genus.<ref name="Nuhn 2013">{{cite journal |vauthors=Nuhn ME, Binder M, ((Taylor AFS)), Halling RE, Hibbett DS |title=Phylogenetic overview of the [[Boletineae]] |journal=Fungal Biology |year=2013 |volume=117 |issue=7–8 |pages=479–511 |doi=10.1016/j.funbio.2013.04.008|pmid=23931115 }}</ref> The species was hence transferred to the new genus ''[[Rubroboletus]]'' in 2014, along with several allied red-pored, blue-staining bolete species.<ref name="Zhao 2014"/> Genetic testing on several species of the genus revealed that ''R. satanas'' is most closely related to ''[[Rubroboletus pulchrotinctus|R. pulchrotinctus]]'', a morphologically similar but much rarer species occurring in the [[Mediterranean]] regions.<ref name="Loizides 2019"/>

===Common names===
Both ''Rubroboletus satanas'' and ''[[Suillellus luridus]]'' are known as ''ayimantari'' ('bear mushroom') in eastern Turkey.<ref name=Dem04>{{cite journal |vauthors=Demirel K, Uzun Y, Kaya A |year=2004|title=Some Poisonous Fungi of East Anatolia |journal=Turk J Bot |volume=28|pages=215–19 |url=http://journals.tubitak.gov.tr/botany/issues/bot-04-28-1-2/bot-28-1-2-23-0207-2.pdf|access-date= 2008-02-08}}</ref>

==Description==
The compact [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] can reach an impressive {{convert|30|cm|0|abbr=on}}, exceptionally {{convert|40|cm|0|abbr=on}}, and very rarely {{convert|50|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter. It is arguably the largest bolete found in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=June 2025}} At first it is hemispherical with an inrolled margin, but becomes convex at maturity as the fruit body expands, while in older specimens the margin might be slightly undulating. When young, the pileus is greyish white to silvery-white or buff, but older specimens tend to develop olivaceous, ochraceous or brownish tinges. The surface of the cap is finely [[tomentose]], becoming smooth at maturity and is often slightly viscid in wet weather. The cuticle is tightly attached to the flesh and does not peel.<ref name="Courtecuisse 1995"/><ref name="Estadès 2004"/>



The free to slightly adnate tubes are up to {{convert|3|mm|frac=8|abbr=on}} long, pale yellow or greenish yellow and bluing when cut. The pores (tube mouths) are rounded, yellow to orange at first, but soon turning red from the point of their attachment to the stem outwards, eventually becoming entirely purplish red or carmine-red at full maturity and instantly bluing when touched or bruised. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|5–15|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, extraordinarily {{convert|20|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, very rarely {{convert|25|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long, distinctly bulbous ({{convert|4–12|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}, extraordinarily {{convert|16|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}, very rarely {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on|disp=or}}), and often wider than its length, becoming more ventricose as the fungus expands but remaining bulbous at the base. Its colour is golden-yellow to orange at the apex, becoming increasingly pinkish-red to reddish-orange further down and deep carmine-red to purple-red towards the base. It is decorated in a fine, yellowish to reddish hexagonal net, sometimes confined to the upper half of the stipe. The flesh is thick, spongy and whitish, but may be yellow to straw-coloured in immature specimens and is sometimes reddish at the stem base. It slowly turns a faded blue colour when cut, bluing more intensely around the apex and above the tubes. The smell is weak and pleasantly musky in young fruit bodies, but becomes increasingly putrid in older specimens, reminiscent of carrion.<ref name="Galli 2007"/> Young specimens have a reportedly pleasant, nutty taste.<ref name=Zeitl76>{{cite book|author=Zeitlmayr L|year=1976|title=Wild Mushrooms:An Illustrated Handbook|publisher=Garden City Press, Hertfordshire|isbn=0-584-10324-7|page=102}}</ref> The [[spore print]] is olivaceous green.<ref name="Kibby 2016"/>

The spores are fusiform (spindle-shaped) when viewed under a microscope and measure 10–16 × 4.5–7.5&nbsp;[[μm]]. The cap cuticle is composed of interwoven septate hyphae, which are often finely incrusted.<ref name="Munoz 2005"/><ref name="Breitenbach 1991"/>

===Similar species===
Satan's bolete can be confused with a number of other species:

*''[[Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus]]'' is found predominantly on [[acidic soil]], develops pinkish tinges of the cap, has a more or less cylindrical or clavate stipe with a very dense, well-developed net and lemon-yellow flesh that distinctly stains blue only in the cap when longitudinally sliced.
*''[[Rubroboletus legaliae]]'' is also acidophilous, has pinkish tinges on the cap, flesh that stains more extensively blue when cut and narrower spores, measuring 9–15 × 4–6 μm.
*''[[Rubroboletus pulchrotinctus]]'' has a variable cap colour often featuring a pinkish band at the margin; has a dull-coloured stipe without deep red tinges, pores that remain yellow or orange even in mature fruit bodies, and somewhat narrower spores, measuring 12–15 × 4.5–6 μm.
*''[[Rubroboletus rubrosanguineus]]'' is associated with spruce (''[[Picea]]'') or fir (''[[Abies]]''), has pinkish tinges on the cap and smaller spores, measuring 10–14.5 × 4–6 μm.
*''[[Caloboletus calopus]]'' is usually associated with coniferous trees, has pores that remain persistently yellow even in overripe fruit bodies, has a more slender, cylindrical or clavate stipe and narrower spores, measuring 11–16 × 4–5.5 μm.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Rubroboletus satanas'' is widely distributed throughout the temperate zone, but is rare in most of its reported localities. In Europe, it mostly occurs in the southern regions and is rare or absent in northern countries. It fruits in the summer and early autumn in warm, [[broad-leaved]] and mixed forests, forming [[ectomycorrhizal]] associations with oak (''[[Quercus]]'') and sweet chestnut (''[[Castanea (plant)|Castanea]]''), with a preference for [[calcareous]] (chalky) soils. Other frequently reported hosts are hornbeam (''[[Carpinus]]''), beech (''[[Fagus (plant)|Fagus]]'') and lime and linden trees (''[[Tilia]]'').<ref name="Munoz 2005"/><ref name="Galli 2007"/>

==Toxicity==


This mushroom is moderately [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]], especially if eaten raw.

Controversially, English mycologist [[John Ramsbottom (mycologist)|John Ramsbottom]] reported in 1953 that ''R.&nbsp;satanas'' is consumed in certain parts of Italy and the former [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name = "Ramsbottom53"/> In those regions, the fungus is reportedly eaten following prolonged boiling that may neutralise the toxins, though this has never been proven scientifically. Similar reports exist from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] of the United States,<ref name=Thiers75/> but probably involve a different fungus misidentified as ''R.&nbsp;satanas''. Ramsbottom speculated that there may be a regional variation in its toxicity, and conceded that the fungus may not be as poisonous as widely reported.<ref name = "Ramsbottom53"/> Nevertheless, ''R.&nbsp;satanas'' is rarely sampled casually, not least because of the foul smell, which in addition to their bright red colour and blue staining, make this fungus unappealing for human consumption.<ref name=Benj95/>
