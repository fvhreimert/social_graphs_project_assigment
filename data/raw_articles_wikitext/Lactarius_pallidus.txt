'''''Lactarius pallidus''''', the '''pale milkcap''', is an [[edible mushroom]] of the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]''. It is pale in colour, and found on the floor in [[beech]] or [[birch]] woodland. It's smooth [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] features a particularly thick layer of flesh and often has an incurved margin. Though generally considered [[edible mushroom|edible]], it is not recommended to be eaten raw. It is common in [[Europe]], and less common in [[North America]] and [[Australasia]].

==Taxonomy==
''Lactarius pallidus'' was classified as a member of ''Lactarius'' by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. It was first described by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]],<ref name="Phillips"/> who named it ''Agaricus pallidus''<ref>{{cite book |title= Bibliographical Index of North American Fungi - Vol I - Abrothallus to Badhamia|last= Farlow|first= W.

==Description==

''Lactarius pallidus'' has a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of {{convert|4|to|10|cm|in}} across. In shape, it is initially a flattened convex, developing a funnel-shaped depression with age. It is pale buff in colour, sometimes dull but often with a rosy tint. It can also be a pale brown or pale flesh colour. The cap is smooth, firm, and sticky, and has a thick layer of white to buff flesh. The margin is incurved on younger specimens.<ref name="Phillips"/> The pale colour, incurved margin, and smooth cap are its most distinguishing features.<ref name="Pegler"/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|3|to|8|cm|in}} long, by {{convert|6|to|28|mm|in}} thick. In shape, the stem is cylindrical or slightly narrowed at the base, and is concolorous with the cap or whitish. The moderately decurrent, crowded gills are pale rosy buff to yellowish buff, and leak white [[latex|milk]]. The spores are elliptic, with ridges of varying thickness running across them, forming few cross-connections. They typically measure 8 to 10 by 6 to 7 [[micrometre]]s. The spores leave a [[spore print]] that is pale ochre with a slight salmon tinge.<ref name="Phillips">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe|last= Phillips|first= Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page= 83}}</ref>

''Lactarius pallidus'' is similar in appearance to ''[[Lactarius affinis|L. affinis]]'', but is differentiated by the fact that the former lacks the peppery taste of the latter.<ref name="McKnight"/>

==Edibility==
Though generally considered edible,<ref>{{cite book |title= British Edible Fungi|last= Cooke|first= M. C.|year= 2007|publisher= Read Books|isbn= 978-1-4067-5608-1|page= 230|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lOrahbcWdKAC&q=%22Lactarius+pallidus%22&pg=PA230}}</ref> especially after cooking,<ref name="Phillips"/> ''L. pallidus'' has been described by some mycologists as inedible.<ref name="Pegler">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Toadstools|last= Pegler|first= David N.|year= 1983|publisher= Mitchell Beazley Publishing|location= London|isbn= 0-85533-500-9|page= 115}}</ref> The milk has a mild to moderately hot taste.<ref name="Phillips"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Lactarius pallidus'' is typically found growing [[mycorrhizal]]ly under [[beech]], but can also be found under [[birch]].<ref name="Pegler"/> It is typically half-buried among [[leaf litter]].<ref name="Pegler"/> It can sometimes be found in large groups,<ref name="Pegler"/> and occurs throughout summer and autumn.<ref name="Phillips"/> It can be found commonly in [[Europe]] but is much rarer in [[North America]].<ref name="McKnight">{{cite book |title= A Field Guide to Mushrooms, North America|last= McKnight|first= Vera B.|author2=Peterson, Roger Tory |year= 1998|publisher= [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|isbn= 978-0-395-91090-0|page= 326|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=kSdA3V7Z9WcC&q=%22Lactarius+pallidus%22&pg=RA1-PA326}}</ref> It can also be found in [[Australia]].<ref name="May"/>
