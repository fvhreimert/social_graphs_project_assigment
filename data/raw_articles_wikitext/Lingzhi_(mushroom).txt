'''Lingzhi''' ('''''Ganoderma sichuanense'''''), also known as '''reishi''', is a [[polypore]] [[fungus]] ("bracket fungus") native to [[East Asia]] belonging to the [[Genus (biology)|genus]] ''[[Ganoderma]]''.

Its reddish brown, varnished, kidney-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] with bands and peripherally inserted [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] give it a distinct [[hand fan|fan]]-like appearance.  When fresh, the lingzhi is soft, cork-like, and flat. It lacks [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on its underside, and instead releases its [[spores]] via fine pores (80–120 μm) in yellow colors.<ref name="Cao 2012"/>

In nature, it grows at the base and stumps of [[deciduous tree]]s, especially [[maple]]s.  Only two or three out of 10,000 such trees will have lingzhi growth, and therefore its wild form is rare.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}  Lingzhi may be cultivated on [[hardwood]] logs, [[sawdust]], or [[woodchips]].

The lingzhi mushroom is used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].<ref name="Cao 2012">{{cite journal |last1=Cao |first1=Yun |last2=Wu |first2=Sheng-Hua |last3=Dai |first3=Yu-Cheng |title=Species clarification of the prize medicinal Ganoderma mushroom 'Lingzhi' |journal=[[Fungal Diversity]] |year=2012 |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=49–62 |doi=10.1007/s13225-012-0178-5 |s2cid=15239238 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kenneth |first=Jones |title=Reishi: Ancient Herb for Modern Times |year=1990 |publisher=Sylvan Press |page=6}}</ref>

== Taxonomy ==
Lingzhi, also known as ''reishi'' from its Japanese pronunciation, is the ancient "mushroom of immortality", revered for over 2,000 years (with some evidence suggesting use in Neolithic China 6,800 years ago).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Sun |first1=Guoping |last2=Cao |first2=Lijuan |last3=Huang |first3=Luqi |last4=Wang |first4=Yajun |last5=Yuan |first5=Yuan |last6=Han |first6=Dong |last7=Yuan |first7=Bing |last8=Wang |first8=Yeran |last9=Shen |first9=Yueming |date=2018-05-01 |title=Archaeological evidence suggests earlier use of ''Ganoderma'' in Neolithic China |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |volume=63 |issue=13 |pages=1180–1188 |doi=10.1360/n972018-00188 |s2cid=103581412 |issn=0023-074X|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, as of 2023 there is an ongoing debate on which one of the described ''Ganoderma'' species is the true lingzhi mushroom. It is also likely that a few similar ''Ganoderma'' species were considered interchangeable.

In the scientific literature, the lingzhi mushroom is ambiguously referred to as:

* ''Ganoderma sichuanense'' — the currently accepted name, described by Zhao and Zhang (1983).<ref name="Zhao 1983">{{Cite book |first=Chi-ting |last=Chao |title=Taxonomic studies on the family Ganodermataceae of China II. |oclc=80615364}}</ref>
* ''Ganoderma lingzhi'' — described by Cao et al. (2012)<ref name="Cao 2012" /> as a novel species that may be the best fit for traditional definitions of the lingzhi mushroom. However, Du et al. (2023)<ref name="Du 2023" /> found that it is the same species as ''G. sichuanense'', so it is now treated as a later synonym.
* ''[[Ganoderma lucidum]]'' — the type species of ''Ganoderma'' was first described in 1781 by Curtis as ''Boletus lucidus'' based on European collections. In 1881 Karst designated it as the type species of his new genus ''Ganoderma,'' as ''Ganoderma lucidum''.  Early literature used ''G.&nbsp;lucidum'' for collections from China, but it was later established that Asian populations are distinct from European, both morphologically and phylogenetically.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Pegler |first1=D. N. |last2=Yao |first2=Y. J. |date=1996 |title=Oriental species of Ganoderma section Ganoderma |journal=Botany and Mycology for the Next Millenium: Collection of Scientific Articles Devoted to the 70th Anniversary of Academician Sytnik KM |publisher=Kholodny NG Institute of Botany, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine |publication-place=Kyiv |pages=336–347}}</ref><ref name="Du 2023" /> As the lingzhi fungus is strongly rooted in culture, the old name persists, even though it is well established that ''G.&nbsp;sichuanense'' and ''G.&nbsp;lucidum'' are distinct species.

One source employed to solve the task of identifying the traditional lingzhi mushroom is the 16th century Chinese herbal compendium, the {{transliteration|zh|[[Bencao Gangmu]]}} (1578). There, a number of different lingzhi-like mushrooms defined by color were used for different purposes. No exact current species can be attached to these ancient lingzhi for certain, but according to Dai et al. (2017),<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dai |first1=Y.-C. |title=Ganoderma lingzhi (Polyporales, Basidiomycota): the scientific binomial for the widely cultivated medicinal fungus Lingzhi |journal=Mycological Progress |date=2017 |volume=16 |issue=11–12 |pages=1051–1055|doi=10.1007/s11557-017-1347-4 |bibcode=2017MycPr..16.1051D |s2cid=38561105 }}</ref> as well as other researchers, and based on molecular work, red lingzhi is most likely to be ''Ganoderma sichuanense''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dai|first1=Yu-Cheng|last2=Zhou|first2=Li-Wei|last3=Hattori|first3=Tsutomu|last4=Cao|first4=Yun|last5=Stalpers|first5=Joost A.|last6=Ryvarden|first6=Leif|last7=Buchanan|first7=Peter|last8=Oberwinkler|first8=Franz|last9=Hallenberg|first9=Nils|last10=Liu|first10=Pei-Gui|last11=Wu|first11=Sheng-Hua|date=December 2017|title=Ganoderma lingzhi (Polyporales, Basidiomycota): the scientific binomial for the widely cultivated medicinal fungus Lingzhi|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11557-017-1347-4|journal=Mycological Progress|language=en|volume=16|issue=11–12|pages=1051–1055|doi=10.1007/s11557-017-1347-4|bibcode=2017MycPr..16.1051D |s2cid=38561105 |issn=1617-416X|url-access=subscription}}</ref><ref name="Cao 2012" />

''Ganoderma sichuanense'' is the most widely found species in Chinese herb shops today,{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}} and the fruiting bodies are widely cultivated in China and shipped to many other countries. About 7–10 other ''Ganoderma'' species are also sold in some shops, but have different Chinese and Latin names, and are considered different in their activity and functions. The differences are based on concentrations of [[triterpenes]] such as [[ganoderic acid]] and its derivatives, which vary widely among species. Research on the genus is ongoing, but a number of recent phylogenetic analyses have been published in recent years.<ref name="Zhou 2015">{{cite journal |last1=Zhou |first1=Li-Wei |last2=Cao |first2=Yun |last3=Wu |first3=Sheng-Hua |last4=Vlasák |first4=Josef |last5=Li |first5=De-Wei |last6=Li |first6=Meng-Jie |last7=Dai |first7=Yu-Cheng |title=Global diversity of the ''Ganoderma lucidum'' complex (Ganodermataceae, Polyporales) inferred from morphology and multilocus phylogeny |journal=Phytochemistry |year=2015 |volume=114 |pages=7–15 |doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2014.09.023 |pmid=25453909|bibcode=2015PChem.114....7Z }}</ref>

=== Nomenclature ===
[[Petter Adolf Karsten]] first described the genus ''[[Ganoderma]]'' in 1881,.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Steyaert |first=R. L. |title=Note on the nomenclature of fungi and, incidentally, of ''Ganoderma lucidum'' |journal=Taxon |year=1961 |volume=10 |issue=8 |pages=251–252 |url=http://www.iapt-taxon.org/historic/Congress/IBC_1964/nom_fung.pdf|doi=10.2307/1216350 |jstor=1216350 |bibcode=1961Taxon..10..251S }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Karsten |first=PA. |title=Enumeratio Boletinearum et Polyporearum Fennicarum, systemate novo dispositarum |journal=Revue Mycologique, Toulouse |year=1881 |volume=3 |issue=9 |pages=16–19 |language=la}}</ref> He designated as its type species a European fungus named ''Boletus lucidus'' by English botanist [[William Curtis]] in 1781. Since then, many other ''Ganoderma'' species have been described.

The lingzhi's [[botanical name]]s have [[Greek and Latin roots in English|Greek and Latin roots]]. ''Ganoderma'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{transliteration|grc|ganos}} ({{lang|grc|γανος}}; {{gloss|brightness}}), and {{transliteration|grc|derma}} ({{lang|grc|δερμα}}; {{gloss|skin; together; shining skin}}).<ref name="Liddell 1980">{{cite book |last1=Liddell |first1=Henry George |last2=Scott |first2=Robert |author-link1=Henry George Liddell |author-link2=Robert Scott (philologist) |title=A Greek-English Lexicon |year=1980 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=United Kingdom |isbn=978-0-19-910207-5 |edition=Abridged|title-link=A Greek-English Lexicon }}</ref> The [[Specific name (botany)|specific epithet]], ''sichuanense'', comes from the [[Sichuan]] Chinese province. The common name, lingzhi, comes from [[Chinese language|Chinese]], meaning {{gloss|divine mushroom}}.

=== Varieties ===
It was once thought that ''G. lingzhi'' generally occurred in two growth forms: a large, [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]], specimen with a small or nonexistent stalk, found in North America, and a smaller specimen with a long, narrow stalk, found mainly in the tropics. However, recent molecular evidence has identified the former, stalkless, form as a distinct species called ''[[Ganoderma sessile|G. sessile]]'', a name given to North American specimens by William Alfonso Murrill in 1902.<ref name="Zhou 2015" /><ref>{{cite web |title=''Ganoderma sessile'' |url=http://www.mycobank.org/Biolomics.aspx?Table=Mycobank&MycoBankNr_=237038 |website=[[MycoBank]] |publisher=[[International Mycological Association]]}}</ref>

Environmental conditions play a substantial role in the lingzhi's manifest morphological characteristics. For example, elevated [[carbon dioxide]] levels result in stem [[wikt:elongation|elongation]] in lingzhi. Other formations include antlers without a cap, which may also be related to carbon dioxide levels. The three main factors that influence fruit body development morphology are light, temperature, and humidity. While water and air quality play a role in fruit body development morphology, they do so to a lesser degree.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Yajima |first1=Yuka |last2=Miyazaki |first2=Minoru |last3=Okita |first3=Noriyasu |last4=Hoshino |first4=Tamotsu |title=Production of Ginkgo Leaf−Shaped Basidiocarps of the Lingzhi or Reishi Medicinal Mushroom ''Ganoderma lucidum'' (Higher Basidiomycetes), Containing High Levels of α- and β-D-Glucan and Ganoderic Acid A |journal=International Journal of Medicinal Mushrooms |year=2013 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=175–182 |doi=10.1615/IntJMedMushr.v15.i2.60|pmid=23557369 }}</ref>

=== Other uses ===
Lingzhi is commercially manufactured and sold. Since the early 1970s, most lingzhi is cultivated. Lingzhi can grow on substrates such as sawdust, grain, and wood logs. After formation of the fruiting body, lingzhi is most commonly harvested, dried, ground, and processed into tablets or capsules to be directly ingested or made into tea or soup. Other lingzhi products include processed fungal mycelia or spores.<ref name="Wachtel-Galor 2011" /> Lingzhi is also used to create [[mycelium]] bricks.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Andy Corbley |date=2020-12-10 |title=Stanford Designer is Making Bricks Out of Fast-Growing Mushrooms That Are Stronger than Concrete |url=https://www.goodnewsnetwork.org/phil-ross-invents-mycelium-mushroom-bricks-arch/ |access-date=2021-01-05 |website=Good News Network |language=en-US}}</ref>

The (1596) {{transliteration|zh|[[Bencao Gangmu]]}} (''Compendium of Materia Medica'') has a {{transliteration|zh|Zhi}} ({{lang|zh|芝}}) category that includes six types of {{transliteration|zh|zhi}} (calling the green, red, yellow, white, black, and purple mushrooms of the {{transliteration|zh|Shennong bencao jing}} the ''liuzhi'' (六芝; "six mushrooms") and sixteen other fungi, mushrooms, and lichens, including ''mu'er'' (木耳; "wood ear"; "[[cloud ear fungus]]", ''[[Auricularia auricula-judae]]''). The author [[Li Shizhen]] classified these six differently colored ''zhi'' as ''xiancao'' (仙草; "immortality herbs"), and described the effects of ''chizhi'' ("red mushroom"):

The ''Bencao Gangmu'' does not list ''lingzhi'' as a variety of ''zhi'', but as an alternate name for the ''shi'er'' (石耳; "stone ear", ''[[Umbilicaria esculenta]]'') lichen. According to Stuart and Smith,
{{Blockquote|text=[The 石耳 Shih-erh is] edible, and has all of the good qualities of the 芝 (Chih), it is also being used in the treatment of [[Kidney stone|gravel]], and said to benefit virility.

The [[Old Chinese]] name for lingzhi {{lang|och|靈芝}} was first recorded during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 9 AD). In the [[Chinese language]], {{transliteration|zh|língzhī}} ({{lang|zh|靈芝}}) is a compound. It comprises {{transliteration|zh|líng}} ({{lang|zh|靈}}); "spirit, spiritual; soul; miraculous; sacred; divine; mysterious; efficacious; effective)" as, for example, in the name of the [[Lingyan Temple (Jinan)|Lingyan Temple]] in [[Jinan]], and {{transliteration|zh|zhī}} ({{lang|zh|芝}}); "(traditional) plant of longevity; fungus; seed; branch; mushroom; excrescence"). [[Fabrizio Pregadio]] notes, "The term ''zhi'', which has no equivalent in Western languages, refers to a variety of supermundane substances often described as plants, fungi, or 'excrescences'."<ref name="Pregadio 2008">{{cite book |editor-last=Pregadio |editor-first=Fabrizio |editor-link=Fabrizio Pregadio |title=The Encyclopedia of Taoism |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |page=1271 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&pg=PP1 |quote=''Zhi'' 芝 numinous mushrooms; excrescences|isbn=978-0-203-69548-7 }}</ref> ''Zhi'' occurs in other Chinese plant names, such as {{transliteration|zh|zhīmá}} ({{lang|zh|芝麻}}; "sesame" or "seed"), and was anciently used a [[phonetic loan character]] for {{transliteration|zh|zhǐ }} ({{lang|zh|芷}}; "[[Angelica]] iris"). Chinese differentiates ''Ganoderma'' species into {{transliteration|zh|chìzhī}} ({{lang|zh|赤芝}}; "red mushroom") ''G. lingzhi'', and {{transliteration|zh|zǐzhī}} ({{lang|zh|紫芝}}; "purple mushroom") ''[[Ganoderma sinense]]''.

Lingzhi has several [[synonyms]]. Of these, {{transliteration|zh|ruìcǎo}} ({{lang|zh|瑞草}}; "auspicious plant") ({{transliteration|zh|ruì}} {{lang|zh|瑞}}; "auspicious; felicitous omen" with the suffix {{transliteration|zh|cǎo}} {{lang|zh|草}}; "plant; herb") is the oldest; the ''[[Erya]]'' dictionary (c. 3rd century BCE) defines {{transliteration|zh|xiú}} {{lang|zh|苬}}, interpreted as a [[wiktionary:miscopy|miscopy]] of {{transliteration|zh|jūn}} ({{lang|zh|菌}}; "mushroom") as {{transliteration|zh|zhī}} ({{lang|zh|芝}}; "mushroom"), and the commentary of [[Guo Pu]] (276–324) says, "The [''zhi''] flowers three times in one year. It is a [''ruicao''] felicitous plant."<ref>{{cite book |last=Bretschneider |first=E. |title=Botanicon Sinicum |date=1893 |publisher=[[Kelly & Walsh]] |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_UIAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> Other Chinese names for ''Ganoderma'' include {{transliteration|zh|ruìzhī}} ({{lang|zh|瑞芝}}; "auspicious mushroom"), {{transliteration|zh|shénzhī}} ({{lang|zh|神芝}}; "divine mushroom", with [[Shen (Chinese religion)|shen]]; "spirit; god' supernatural; divine"), {{transliteration|zh|mùlíngzhī}} ({{lang|zh|木靈芝}}) (with "tree; wood"), {{transliteration|zh|xiāncǎo}} ({{lang|zh|仙草}}; "immortality plant", with [[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]; "(Daoism) transcendent; immortal; wizard"), and {{transliteration|zh|língzhīcǎo}} ({{lang|zh|靈芝草}}) or {{transliteration|zh|zhīcǎo}} ({{lang|zh|芝草}}; "mushroom plant").

==== English ====
In English, ''lingzhi'' or ''ling chih'' (sometimes spelled "''ling chi''", using the French [[EFEO Chinese transcription]]) is a [[Loanword#In English|Chinese loanword]]. It is also commonly referred to as "''reishi''", which is loaned from Japanese.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Ganoderma lucidum|title=The Fungal Pharmacy: The Complete Guide to Medicinal Mushrooms & Lichens of North America|author-last=Rogers|author-first=Robert|place=BErkeley, CA|publisher=North Atlantic Books|date=2011|isbn=978-1-55643-953-7|pages=172–185}}</ref>

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) gives the definition, "The fungus ''Ganoderma lucidum'' (actually ''Ganoderma lingzhi'' (see ''[[Ganoderma lucidum]]'' for details), believed in China to confer longevity and used as a symbol of this on Chinese ceramic ware.",<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford English Dictionary |year=2009 |edition=CD-ROM |version=4.0 |chapter=ling chih|title-link=Oxford English Dictionary }}</ref> and identifies the [[etymology]] of the word as Chinese: ''líng'', "divine" + ''zhī'', "fungus". According to the ''OED'', the earliest recorded usage of the [[Wade–Giles]] romanization ''ling chih'' is 1904,<ref>{{cite book |last=Bushell |first=Stephen Wootton |author-link=Stephen Wootton Bushell |title=Chinese Art |publisher=H.M. Stationery Office |year=1904 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ost-art-chinese_art/page/n316 148] |url=https://archive.org/details/ost-art-chinese_art}} ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]]); This context describes the ''lingzhi'' fungus and [[Ruyi (scepter)|ruyi scepter]] as Daoist symbols of longevity on a jade vase.</ref> and of the [[Pinyin]] ''lingzhi'' is 1980.

In addition to the transliterated loanwords, English names include "glossy ganoderma" and "shiny polyporus".<ref>{{cite web |title=Names of a Selection of Asian Fungi |url=http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Fungi_Asian.html |website=Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |date=18 February 1999}}</ref>

==== Japanese ====
The [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word {{transliteration|ja|reishi}} ({{lang|ja|霊芝}}) is a [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]] loanword deriving from the Chinese {{transliteration|zh|língzhī}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|灵芝}}; {{lang|zh-Hant|靈芝}}). Its modern Japanese [[kanji]], {{lang|ja-Hani|霊}}, is the [[shinjitai]] ("new character form") of the [[kyūjitai]] ("old character form"), {{lang|ja-Hant|靈}}. Synonyms for ''reishi'' are divided between Sino-Japanese borrowings and native Japanese coinages. Sinitic loanwords include literary terms such as {{transliteration|ja|zuisō}} ({{lang|ja|瑞草}}, from {{transliteration|zh|ruìcǎo}}; "auspicious plant") and {{transliteration|ja|sensō}} ({{lang|ja|仙草}}, from {{transliteration|zh|xiāncǎo}}; "immortality plant"). The [[Japanese writing system]] uses {{transliteration|ja|shi}} or {{transliteration|ja|shiba}} ({{lang|ja|芝}}) for "grass; lawn; turf", and ''take'' or {{transliteration|ja|kinoko}} ({{lang|ja|茸}}) for "mushroom" (e.g., [[shiitake]]). A common native Japanese name is {{transliteration|ja|mannentake}} ({{lang|ja|万年茸}}; "10,000-year mushroom"). Other Japanese terms for ''reishi'' include {{transliteration|ja|kadodetake}} ({{lang|ja|門出茸}}; "departure mushroom"), {{transliteration|ja|hijiridake}} ({{lang|ja|聖茸}}; "sage mushroom"), and {{transliteration|ja|magoshakushi}} ({{lang|ja|孫杓子}}; "grandchild ladle").

==== Korean ====
The [[Korean language|Korean]] name, {{transliteration|ko|yeongji}} ({{Korean|hangul=영지|hanja=靈芝}}) is also borrowed from, so a [[cognate]] with, the Chinese word {{transliteration|zh|língzhī}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|灵芝}}; {{lang|zh-Hant|靈芝}}). It is often called ''yeongjibeoseot'' ({{lang|ko|영지버섯}}; "''yeongji'' mushroom") in Korean, with the addition of the native word {{transliteration|ko|beoseot}} ({{lang|ko|버섯}}) meaning "mushroom". Other common names include {{transliteration|ko|bullocho}} ({{Korean|hangul=불로초|hanja=不老草|labels=no}}; "elixir grass") and {{transliteration|ko|jicho}} ({{Korean|hangul=지초|hanja=芝草|labels=no}}). According to color, ''yeongji'' mushrooms can be classified as {{transliteration|ko|jeokji}} ({{Korean|hangul=적지|hanja=赤芝|labels=no}}) for "red", {{transliteration|ko|jaji}} ({{Korean|hangul=자지|hanja=紫芝|labels=no}}) for "purple", {{transliteration|ko|heukji}} ({{Korean|hangul=흑지|hanja=黑芝|labels=no}}) for "black", {{transliteration|ko|cheongji}} ({{Korean|hangul=청지|hanja=靑芝|labels=no}}) for "blue" or "green", {{transliteration|ko|baekji}} ({{Korean|hangul=백지|hanja=白芝|labels=no}}) for "white", and {{transliteration|ko|hwangji}} ({{Korean|hangul=황지|hanja=黃芝|labels=no}}) for "yellow". South Korea produces over 25,000 tons of mushrooms every year.

==== Thai ====
The [[Thai language|Thai]] word {{transliteration|th|het lin chue}} ({{lang|th|เห็ดหลินจือ}}) is a compound of the native word {{transliteration|th|het}} ({{lang|th|เห็ด}}) meaning "mushroom" and the loanword {{transliteration|th|lin chue}} ({{lang|th|หลินจือ}}) from the Chinese {{transliteration|zh|língzhī}} ({{lang|zh-Hans|灵芝}}; {{lang|zh-Hant|靈芝}}).

==== Vietnamese ====
The [[Vietnamese language]] word {{lang|vi|linh chi}} is a loanword from Chinese. It is often used with {{lang|vi|nấm}}, the Vietnamese word for "mushroom", thus {{lang|vi|nấm linh chi}} is the equivalent of "lingzhi mushroom".
