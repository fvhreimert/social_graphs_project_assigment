'''''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa''''', also known as '''rhododendron psilocybe''' and '''blue-haired psilocybe''',  is a [[psilocybin mushroom]] of the family [[Hymenogastraceae]]<!--, in the section Semilanceatae,--> having [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as main active compounds. First documented in 1980 in the [[Pacific Northwest]], it is relatively uncommon and can be distinguished from other closely related species by its smaller spores and forking [[cheilocystidia]].
''[[Psilocybe cyanescens]]'' also has forking [[cheilocystidia]], but less often than ''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa''. ''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' is also distinguished from ''Psilocybe cyanescens'' by an absence of [[pleurocystidia]]. 
The name of this species refers to the fibrils on the [[Stipe (mycology)]] that turn bluish in age, or when handled.

This species is closely related to ''[[Psilocybe subfimetaria]]''.

==Description==
''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' has a [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] smell and taste.

===Pileus===
The [[pileus (mycology)|Pileus]] is 1.4–3.5&nbsp;cm in diameter and [[conic]] to [[wikt:convex|convex]] to broadly convex then becoming flat in age. It is not usually [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]]. The pileus is deep chestnut brown and [[hygrophanous]], fading to yellowish brown or grayish white when dry. The surface is [[wikt:viscid|viscid]] when moist from the separable gelatinous [[pellicle (biology)|pellicle]].

===Gills===
The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are  [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] to [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] to slightly [[wikt:subdecurrent|subdecurrent]] in age. It is light grayish, becoming purplish brown with age while the edges remain whitish.

===Spores===
''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' [[spore]]s are purplish brown in deposit, [[wikt:subellipsoid|subellipsoid]] in shape, and (9)9.5–11(12) x (5.5)6–6.6(7) [[micrometre|μm]].

===Stipe===
The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 3–8&nbsp;cm long and 0.5&nbsp;cm thick. It has an equal structure only enlarging near the base. The stipe is [[wikt:striate|striate]], pallid to yellow brown with fine fibrils that stain blue when handled. The stipe has a [[wikt:cortina|cortina]] that sometimes leaves a fragile [[wikt:annular zone|annular zone]]. White [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]]s are at the base. The flesh is brownish and bruises bluish to indigo-black.

===Microscopic features===
''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' [[basidium|basidia]] each produce four spores, and rarely only two spores. The [[cheilocystidia]] are [[wikt:fusiform|fusiform]] to [[wikt:lanceolate|lanceolate]] and 22–33 x 5.5–7 [[μm]], with an elongated, forking neck and are 1–1.5&nbsp;μm thick at its apex. [[Pleurocystidia]] are absent in ''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa''.

==Habitat and formation==
''Psilocybe cyanofibrillosa'' is found growing scattered to [[gregarious]], from September to December from Northern [[California]] to [[British Columbia, Canada]]. It is found in soils enriched with [[deciduous]] wood debris, among bush [[lupin]]es, in [[Alder]] and [[Willow]] wood chips and bark mulch, [[Fir]] sawdust, in coastal regions, in [[rhododendron]] gardens and nurseries, and in flood plains in river [[estuaries]].

==Chemistry==
Both [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] (0.05&nbsp;mg per gram dry weight and 1.4&nbsp;mg per gram psilocin) were detected by Beug and Bigwood.
