'''''Lactarius rufus''''' is a common, medium-sized member of the mushroom genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'', whose many members are commonly known as milkcaps. Known by the common name of the '''rufous milkcap''', or the '''red hot milk cap''' in [[North America]]. It is dark brick red in color, and grows with [[pine]] or [[birch]] trees. It is suspected of being [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] but has some regional culinary uses.

==Taxonomy==
Described originally by [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]], and later by the Swedish father of modern mycology [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''rufus'' is a reference to its colour.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is up to {{convert|10|cm|frac=4}} in diameter. It is dark brick, bay, or red-brown.  At first it is convex, and often has a small central boss (umbo), but later flattens, eventually acquiring a shallow central depression. The surface is dry and matt. The concolorous, but paler  [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]  often becomes hollow with age. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are slightly decurrent, cream, becoming coloured as the cap later, only paler. The [[spore print]] is creamy white, with a slight salmon tinge. The flesh is white, as is the (abundant) milk, which tastes mild initially, gradually becoming very hot, and acrid after a minute or so.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | last = Phillips |first= Roger| year = 2006  | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=60}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Lactarius rufus'' appears from late spring to late autumn. It is frequent in the northern [[temperate]] zones in [[Europe]] and [[North America]].  It is most commonly found with [[pine]] trees, but can also appear with [[birch]], [[conifer]], or [[spruce]].<ref name=":0" /> It is common in northern [[California]], and the [[Pacific Northwest]] from late summer to early winter.<ref name=Arora1986/>

==Edibility==
''Lactarius rufus'' is generally not recommended for consumption,<ref name=Arora1986>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/79/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=79-80 |orig-date=1979}}</ref><ref name=Roody2003>{{cite book |author=Roody WC. |title=Mushrooms of West Virginia and the Central Appalachians |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=Lexington, Ky |year=2003 |page=102 |isbn=0-8131-9039-8}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=5HGMPEiy4ykC&dq=Lactarius+rufus&pg=PA84 Google Books]</ref> even being considered [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] due to the presence of toxins which may cause [[gastric upset]].<ref name="Miller2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=98}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Roger|title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America|publisher=Firefly Books|year=2010|isbn=978-1-55407-651-2|location=Buffalo, NY|page=122|orig-year=2005}}</ref> However, it is used in some places as a condiment after special treatment.<ref name=Phillips06/> Mycologist [[David Arora]] notes that it is eaten in Scandinavian countries after canning, but may be poisonous raw, being especially untested in North America.<ref name=Arora1986/> As of 1984, it was one of the most common wild mushrooms harvested for food use in [[Finland]].<ref name="Ohenoja 1984">{{cite journal|vauthors=Ohenoja E, Koistinen R|date=1984|title= Fruit body production of larger fungi in Finland. 2: Edible fungi in northern Finland 1976—1978|journal=Annales Botanici Fennici|volume=21|issue=4|pages=357–66|jstor=23726151}}</ref>
