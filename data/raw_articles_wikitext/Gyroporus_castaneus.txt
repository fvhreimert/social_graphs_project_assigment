'''''Gyroporus castaneus''''', commonly known as the '''chestnut bolete''',<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/510/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=510 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> is a small, white-pored mushroom in the [[Gyroporaceae]] of order [[Boletales]]. It has a brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and is usually found with [[oak]] trees. It differs from the true boletes in that the [[spore]]s are a pale straw colour.

== Taxonomy ==
The species was described initially by the French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard]] (1742–1792). Formerly a member of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Paxillaceae]], research now places this mushroom in [[Gyroporaceae]]. ''Gyroporus'' means 'having round pores', and ''castaneus'' is a reference to the chestnut colouration.

== Description ==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is from 3 to 10&nbsp;cm in diameter, and pale to rusty brown in colour,<ref name="Arora1986" /> which becomes darker with age. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is a similar colour,<ref name="Arora1986" /> although it may be lighter at the apex. If the stem is cut vertically, it is usual to find several cavities of differing sizes inside. Both the cap and the stem have a tendency to crack or split in dry periods, or with age. The pores are small and white, yellowing with age,<ref name="Arora1986" /> and are not attached to the stem. They darken slightly when pressed. The tubes are also whitish, and the [[spore print]] is pale yellow to straw. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is firm,<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book | author = Roger Phillips | year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref> and does not change colour on cutting.<ref name="Arora1986" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
The mushroom is found occasionally in Britain and throughout continental Europe, as well as eastern North America, but it is rare in western North America.<ref name="Arora1986" /> It grows in small groups, or singly, in an [[ectomycorrhiza]]l relationship with oaks (''[[Quercus]]''). It prefers acid and sandy soils, and fruits from summer to autumn. In New Zealand, it is found in association with ''[[Leptospermum]]''.<ref name="McNabb 1968">{{cite journal |author=McNabb RFR. |title=The Boletaceae of New Zealand |journal=New Zealand Journal of Botany |year=1968 |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=137–76 (see p.&nbsp;166) |doi=10.1080/0028825X.1968.10429056|doi-access=free |bibcode=1968NZJB....6..137M }} {{open access}}</ref> In Asia, it has been recorded from Taiwan.<ref name="Yeh 1980"/>
