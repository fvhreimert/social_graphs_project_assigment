'''''Exsudoporus frostii''''' (formerly '''''Boletus frostii'''''), [[common name|commonly]] known as '''Frost's bolete''' or the '''apple bolete''', is a [[bolete]] [[fungus]] first described scientifically in 1874. A member of the family [[Boletaceae]], the [[mushroom]]s produced by the fungus have tubes and pores instead of [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of their [[pileus (mycology)|caps]]. It can be recognized by its dark red sticky caps, the red pores, the network-like pattern of the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], and the bluing reaction to tissue injury. Another characteristic of young, moist fruit bodies is the [[amber (color)|amber]]-colored drops exuded on the pore surface. 

The species is distributed in the eastern United States from [[Maine]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and in the southwest from [[Arizona]] extending south to Mexico and [[Costa Rica]]. A [[mycorrhiza]]l species, it is typically found growing near [[hardwood]] trees, especially [[oak]].

Although this mushroom is considered [[edible mushroom|edible]] when thoroughly cooked, it is generally not recommended for consumption because of the risk of confusion with other [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] red-pored, blue-bruising boletes. ''B.&nbsp;frostii'' may be distinguished from other superficially similar red-capped boletes by differences in [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], bluing reaction, distribution, and/or associated tree species.

==Taxonomy==
The species was named by the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[John Lewis Russell]] of [[Salem, Massachusetts]], based on specimens found in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]]. He named the fungus after his friend, fellow amateur American mycologist [[Charles Christopher Frost]], who published a [[species description|description]] of the species in his 1874 survey of the [[bolete]]s of [[New England]].<ref name=Frost1874/><ref name=Weber1980/> When the name of a species is contributed by an individual, but the name is formally published by another, the contributor's name can be cited, separated from the publishing author as ''apud''; for this reason, the name and authority are written ''Boletus Frostii'' Russell ''apud'' Frost in some older literature.<ref name=Singer1947/> [[Bernard Ogilvie Dodge]] made reference to ''B.&nbsp;frostii'' in 1950 during an address to the [[Mycological Society of America]], in which he spoke about the role of the amateur in discovering new species: "They would have informed us all about the man Russell, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Frost, and about the man Frost, who named a fine new bolete for his friend Russell. ''Boletus Frostii'' and ''Boletus Russellii'' are mushrooms with ''character'', even though they were described by amateurs."<ref name=Dodge1952/> However, in attempting to establish a [[lectotype]] specimen, mycologist [[Roy Halling]] examined both Russell's original material and his accompanying notes; he concluded that it was Frost who made the original species determinations, further suggesting that "there is no evidence to show that Russell ever collected ''B.&nbsp;frostii'' or wrote a description of it."<ref name=Halling1983/>

[[William Murrill]] in 1909 placed the species in the genus ''[[Suillellus]]'',<ref name=Murrill1909/> while [[Sanshi Imai]] transferred it to ''Tubiporus'' in 1968.<ref name="urlMycoBank"/> ''Tubiporus'' has since been synonymized with ''[[Boletus]]''.<ref name=Kirk2008/> In 1945, [[Rolf Singer]] described a bolete he found in [[Florida]]; although he originally described it as a [[subspecies]] of ''B.&nbsp;frostii'',<ref name=Singer1945/> he later considered the differences between the [[taxon|taxa]] significant enough to warrant publishing ''[[Boletus floridanus]]'' as a unique species.<ref name=Singer1947/> Following the [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] studies that outlined a new [[phylogenetic]] framework for the Boletaceae,<ref name="Nuhn 2013"/><ref name="Wu 2014"/> the bolete was transferred to the newly [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscribed]] genus ''[[Exsudoporus]]'' in 2014.<ref name="Vizzini 2014"/>

Due to lack of sufficient sequences, Wu and colleagues (2016) were reluctant to accept ''Exsudoporus'' and considered it a synonym of ''[[Butyriboletus]]'', so they transferred ''E.&nbsp;frostii'' to the genus ''Butyriboletus'' and proposed a new combination ''Butyriboletus frostii''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Gang|last2=Li|first2=Yan-Chun|last3=Zhu|first3=Xue-Tai|last4=Zhao|first4=Kuan|last5=Han|first5=Li-Hong|last6=Cui|first6=Yang-Yang|last7=Li|first7=Fang|last8=Xu|first8=Jian-Ping|last9=Yang|first9=Zhu L.|date=November 2016|title=One hundred noteworthy boletes from China|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s13225-016-0375-8|journal=Fungal Diversity|language=en|volume=81|issue=1|pages=25–188|doi=10.1007/s13225-016-0375-8|s2cid=22506275|issn=1560-2745|url-access=subscription}}</ref> However, following phylogenetic and morphological analyses clearly resolved ''Exsudoporus'' as a monophyletic, homogenous and independent genus that is sister to ''Butyriboletus''.<ref name="Loizides 2019"/><ref name=Alona2022/>

''Exsudoporus frostii'' is [[common name|commonly]] known as "Frost's bolete"<ref name="urlRogers" /> or the "apple bolete". In Mexico, its vernacular name is ''panza agria'', which translates to "sour belly".<ref name="Arora1986" />

==Description==
The shape of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the young [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] ranges from a half sphere to convex, later becoming broadly convex to flat or shallowly depressed, with a diameter of {{convert|5–15|cm|1|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Smith1971/> The edge of the cap is curved inward, although as it ages it can uncurl and turn upward. In moist conditions, the cap surface is sticky as a result of its [[pileipellis|cuticle]], which is made of gelatinized [[hypha]]e. If the fruit body has dried out after a rain, the cap is especially shiny,<ref name=Singer1947/> sometimes appearing finely areolate (having a pattern of block-like areas similar to cracked, dried mud).<ref name=Smith1971/> Young mushrooms have a whitish bloom on the cap surface.<ref name=Bessette2000/>

[[image:Exsudoporus frostii 15406.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[hymenium]]]]

The color is bright red initially, but fades with age. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to {{convert|2.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick, and ranges in color from pallid to pale yellow to lemon yellow.<ref name=Smith1971/> The flesh has a variable staining reaction in response to bruising, so some specimens may turn deep blue almost immediately, while others turn blue weakly and slowly.<ref name=Singer1947/> Its taste and odor have been described as pleasant<ref name="urlRogers" /> or sweet<ref name="Miller2006" /> and somewhat like [[citrus]],<ref name="Bessette2000" /> although the cuticle may taste acidic.<ref name="Smith1971" />

The tubes comprising the pore surface (the [[hymenium]]) are 9–15&nbsp;mm deep, yellow to olivaceous yellow (mustard yellow), turning dingy blue when bruised. The pores are small (2 to 3 per mm), circular, and until old age a deep red color that eventually becomes paler. The pore surface is often beaded with yellowish droplets when young (a distinguishing characteristic), and readily stains blue when bruised. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|4 to 12|cm|1|abbr=on}} long, and {{convert|1 to 2.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick at its apex. It is roughly equal in thickness throughout its length, though it may taper somewhat toward the top; some specimens may appear ventricose (swollen in the middle).<ref name=Smith1971/> The stipe surface is mostly red, or yellowish near the base; it is [[wiktionary:reticulate|reticulate]]—characterized by ridges arranged in the form of a net-like pattern.<ref name=Smith1971/> [[Mycelia]], visible at the base of the stipe, are yellowish white to light yellow.<ref name=Singer1947/>

[[image:Exsudoporus frostii 50214.jpg|thumb|Young fruit bodies may secrete an amber liquid.]]

The [[spore print]] of ''B.&nbsp;frostii'' is olive brown.<ref name=Smith1971/> The [[basidiospore|spores]] are thick walled, smooth, and spindle shaped, with dimensions of 11–15 by 4–5&nbsp;[[μm]]. Longer spores up to 18&nbsp;μm long may also be present.<ref name=Smith1971/> The cap cuticle, or [[pileipellis]], is made of a tangled layer of gelatinized hyphae that are 3–6&nbsp;μm wide.<ref name="urlMushroomExpert.Com"/> The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are four spored and measure 26–35 by 10.5–11.5&nbsp;μm. [[Cystidia]] are non-fertile cells interspersed among the basidia, and they are prevalent in the hymenial tissue of ''E.&nbsp;frostii''. These [[hyaline]] (translucent) cells measure 30–53 long by 7.5–14&nbsp;μm wide, and range in shape from somewhat like a spindle (tapering at each end, but with one end typically rounded) to ''subampullaceous''—shaped somewhat like a swollen bottle.<ref name=Singer1947/>

===Similar species===

Other red-capped boletes include the poisonous ''[[Boletus flammans|B.&nbsp;flammans]]'' and ''[[Boletus rubroflammeus|B.&nbsp;rubroflammeus]]''; the former grows most commonly under [[conifer]]s, the latter in association with [[hardwood]]s in eastern North America and southern [[Arizona]].<ref name=Arora1986/> Often confused with ''[[Exsudoporus floridanus]]'' and ''[[Exsudoporus permagnificus|E.&nbsp;permagnificus]]'', but the latter species is known only from Europe and Western Asia and always grow in association with [[oak]]s and occasionally also with [[sweet chestnut]].<ref name=Poeder1981/><ref name=Alessio1981/><ref name=Alona2022/> ''Exsudoporus floridanus'' differs from ''E. &nbsp;frostii'' in having a lighter cap color and in the texture of the cap surface: it is [[tomentose]] (covered with dense, short, soft, matted hairs) or [[wikt:velutinous|velutinous]] (like [[velvet]]), compared to the relatively smooth surface of ''E.&nbsp;frostii''. Singer notes that although the physical characteristics between the two taxa may be blurred and are hard to define, the area of origin can reliably distinguish them: ''E.&nbsp;floridanus'' is found on shaded lawns and [[scrubland]] in open oak stands in non-[[tropical]] regions of Florida, typically on grassy or sandy soil, where it fruits between May and October.<ref name=Singer1947/>

The fruit bodies of young specimens of ''[[Boletus kermesinus|B.&nbsp;kermesinus]]'', newly described from Japan in 2011, are similar in appearance to ''E.&nbsp;frostii''. In addition to its distribution, ''B.&nbsp;kermesinus'' can be distinguished from ''E.&nbsp;frostii'' by having flesh that does not bruise blue and a stipe in which the reticulum is not as deep and coarse.<ref name=Takahashi2011/> ''[[Boletus pseudofrostii|B.&nbsp;pseudofrostii]]'', found in [[Belize]], produces smaller caps that are {{convert|1.7|to|2.0|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter.<ref name=OrtizSantana2007/> ''[[Boletus russelli]]'', found in eastern North America, has a red to reddish-brown cap and reticulate stipe, but its pore surface is yellow, and the fruit body does not bruise blue.<ref name=Kuo2007/>

==Habitat and distribution==
[[image:Exsudoporus frostii 54090.jpg|thumb|upright|Immature specimen with cap not fully expanded; bruising is evident on the stipe.]]

''Exsudoporus frostii'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l species,<ref name=Vozzo1961/> meaning that the fungus forms associations with the roots of various species of trees. The fruit bodies grow solitarily, scattered, or in groups on the ground under hardwood trees. The fungus fruits in summer to early autumn. William Murrill noted its preference for growing in "thin oak woods, where the light is sufficient to enable grass to grow",<ref name="Murrill1909" /> and [[Alexander H. Smith]] mentioned its preference for growing in "thin, sandy soil under scrub oak".<ref name="Weber1980" /> It can be found from June to September in eastern North America.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=333}}</ref> In the United States, it is distributed from [[Maine]] south to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], extending west to [[Tennessee]] and [[Michigan]], and in southern Arizona.<ref name="Singer1947" /><ref name="Bessette2000" /> In Mexico, it is often found under [[Madrone]].<ref name="Arora1986" /> It has also been collected in [[Costa Rica]], where it associates with the oak species ''[[Quercus copeyensis]]'', ''[[Quercus costaricensis|Q.&nbsp;costaricensis]]'', ''[[Quercus rapurahuensis|Q.&nbsp;rapurahuensis]]'', and ''[[Quercus seemanii|Q.&nbsp;seemanii]]''.<ref name="urlBoletus frostii" /> A 1980 publication tentatively suggested that the fungus was also present in Italy,<ref name="Alessio1980" /> but the author later determined that the putative ''E.&nbsp;frostii'' was actually ''[[Exsudoporus permagnificus|Boletus siculus]]'' (now synonymized into ''E.&nbsp;permagnificus'').<ref name="Alessio1981" />

== Ecology ==
The mycorrhizal associations are [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]], because the fungus absorbs [[dietary mineral|mineral]] nutrients from the soil and channels these into the plant, while the plant provides the fungus with sugars, a product of [[photosynthesis]]. The characteristic feature of the mycorrhiza is the presence of a sheath of fungal tissue that encases the terminal, nutrient-absorbing [[wiktionary:rootlet|rootlets]] of the host plant. The fungus forms an extensive underground network of hyphae that radiate outward from the surface of the root sheath, effectively increasing the surface area for nutrient absorption. The hyphae also invade between the root [[cortex (botany)|cortical cells]] to form a [[Hartig net]].<ref name="Deacon2003" /> Using [[microbiological culture|pure culture]] techniques, ''Exsudoporus frostii'' has been shown to form mycorrhizae with [[Virginia pine]] (''Pinus virginiana''),<ref name="Vozzo1961" /> while a field study confirms a similar association with the oak ''[[Quercus laurina]]''.<ref name="Morris2009" />

The fruit bodies can be [[parasitized]] by the mold-like fungus ''[[Sepedonium ampullosporum]]''.<ref name="Sahr1999" /> Infection results in [[necrosis]] of the mushroom tissue and a yellow color caused by the formation of large amounts of [[pigment]]ed aleurioconidia (single-celled [[conidia]] produced by extrusion from the [[conidiophore]]s).<ref name="Neuhof2007" />

== Edibility ==
This species is nonpoisonous.<ref name="Miller2006" /> Murrill wrote in 1910 of its [[edible mushroom|edibility]]: "Usually viewed with suspicion because of its red hymenium, but its properties are not accurately known."<ref name="Murrill1910" /> Since then, several authors have advised against consuming the species, due to its resemblance to other toxic red-capped boletes.<ref name="urlRogers" /><ref name="Smith1971" /><ref name="Bessette1995" /> In his ''100 Edible Mushrooms'' (2007), Michael Kuo notes that although the mushroom is apparently edible for some, it "affects others negatively".<ref name="Kuo2007" /> [[David Arora]] mentions that it is commonly sold in rural markets in Mexico;<ref name="Arora1986" /> a 1997 study suggests that it is only consumed in rural areas of [[Querétaro]].<ref name="León-Guzmán1997" />

[[Food chemistry|Chemical analysis]] of fresh fruit bodies collected in Mexico showed them to have the following composition: [[moisture]] 94.53%; [[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]] 0.323%; [[dietary fiber]] 3.024%; [[fat]] 0.368%; and [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] 1.581%. The [[free fatty acid]] content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common [[Agaricus bisporus|button mushroom]] (''Agaricus bisporus''), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was [[oleic acid]] (1.95%), followed by [[linoleic acid]] (1.68%) and [[palmitic acid]] (1.69%).<ref name="León-Guzmán1997" />
