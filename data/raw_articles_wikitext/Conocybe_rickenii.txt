'''''Conocybe rickenii''''' is a mushroom from the genus ''[[Conocybe]]''. Its [[edible mushroom|edibility]] is disputed, and it has the appearance of a typical [[little brown mushroom]] with a small, conical [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and long, thin [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. In colour, it is generally a cream-brown, lighter on the stem, and it has a thin layer of [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] with no distinct smell or taste. It is a [[coprophilous fungi|coprophilous fungus]], feeding off dung and it is most common on very rich soil or growing directly from dung. It can be found in Europe, Australia and Pacific islands.

==Taxonomy==
''Conocybe rickenii'' was first described in 1930 by German mycologist [[Julius Schäffer]] and named ''Galera rickenii''. It was reclassified by [[Robert Kühner]], who placed it in the genus ''Conocybe''.<ref name="Phillips"/>

==Description==


''Conocybe rickenii'' has a conical cap of {{convert|1|to|2.5|cm|in|1}} across, which is an ochre-brown, sometimes becoming a little more grey at the centre. The stem is typically {{convert|40|to|70|mm|in}} in height, by {{convert|1|to|2|mm|in|2}} in thickness, and is whitish cream, darkening to a dirty brown with age. The thin layer of flesh is grey-brown in the cap, while lighter in the stem. It has ochre-cream (later darkening to rusty-ochre) gills,<ref name="Phillips">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe|last= Phillips|first= Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page= 154}}</ref> which are adnate,<ref name="Pegler">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Toadstools|last= Pegler|first= David N.|year= 1983|publisher= Mitchell Beazley Publishing|location= London|isbn= 0-85533-500-9|page= 162}}</ref> leaving a brown spore print. The spores themselves are elliptic to oval, measuring between 10–20&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]] by 6–12&nbsp;μm. It has two-spored [[basidia]], and a cellular [[cap cuticle]].<ref name="Phillips"/>

It is generally a little larger than the slightly more common coprophilous ''[[Conocybe pubescens|C.&nbsp;pubescens]]'',<ref>Pegler, 162</ref> while it can be differentiated from other dung-loving ''Conocybe'' by its two-spored basidia, large spores and the fact it does not have lecythiform (flask-shaped) [[caulocystidia]].<ref name="Hemmes"/>

==Edibility==
British mycologist [[Roger Phillips (mycologist)|Roger Phillips]] lists the edibility as unknown,<ref name="Phillips"/> while [[David Pegler]] considers it inedible.<ref name="Pegler"/> The flesh has no distinct smell or taste.<ref name="Phillips"/>

==Distribution and habitat==

''Conocybe rickenii'' grows on extremely [[Fertility (soil)|rich soil]], especially on [[feces|dung]] and [[compost heap]]s.<ref name="Phillips"/> It can be found in very large numbers in gardens where horse manure has been used to enrich the soil.<ref name="Pegler"/> It can be found in Europe,<ref name="Phillips"/> Australia,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/search?q=lsid:urn:lsid:catalogueoflife.org:taxon:d6f62a2b-2dc5-11e0-98c6-2ce70255a436:col20120124#tab_recordsView|title=Occurrence search: ''Conocybe rickenii'' |access-date=2014-01-21 |work=Atlas of Living Australia |publisher=[[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] (GBIF)}}</ref> and [[Pacific islands]] and the United States.<ref name="Hemmes">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms of Hawai'i|last= Hemmes|first= Don E.|author2=Desjardin, Dennis E.|year= 2002|publisher= Ten Speed Press|isbn= 978-1-58008-339-3|page= 56|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xbEC2PrmZZkC&q=%22Conocybe+rickenii%22&pg=PA56|access-date= 29 March 2009}}</ref>
