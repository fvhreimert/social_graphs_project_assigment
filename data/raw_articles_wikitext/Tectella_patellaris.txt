'''''Tectella patellaris''''', commonly known as the '''veiled panus''', is a species of [[mushroom]] in the family [[Mycenaceae]]. The small, inconspicuous, dull brown mushroom is found in groups or clusters on the decaying wood of broad-leaved trees.  Young specimens are easily recognized by the presence of a partial veil, as there are no other agarics that lack a stipe and have a partial veil.

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] may be somewhat viscid when wet. Dimensions of the cap are approximately 0.5–2.0&nbsp;cm across.  The fruit body is generally small, brown, and clamshell-shaped. ''Tectella patellaris'' often lacks a true [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], but may include a very short one:<ref name="Central"/> the stipitate point of attachment manifests as a lateral extension of the pileus, ranging from 0.1 to 0.3&nbsp;cm.<ref name=Phillips/> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] radiate from this central point of attachment. This mushroom is [[saprobic]] and found on fallen logs of hardwoods in North America and Europe.  The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''patellaris'' means "dish shaped".<ref name="Central"/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "Veiled Panus".<ref name="Central"/> The snuff brown gills of young specimens are covered with a buff white ephemeral partial veil that may be absent in older specimens.  The spore deposit from ''Tectella patellaris'' is white.<ref name="Central">{{cite book | last = C.

===Microscopic characteristics===
The [[spore]]s are 3–4&nbsp;×&nbsp;1–1.5&nbsp;[[μm]], smooth, and cylindrical, and weakly amyloid. Spores are white in mass. Cheilocystidia are present on gill edges.<ref name="Central"/>

===Similar species===
''Tectella patellaris'' can be distinguished from other saprophytic, white-spored, pendulous species by the presence of its partial veil and unique lamellar attachment.  ''Panellus stipticus'' is tougher, lacks the partial veil, and is luminescent.  ''[[Crepidotus mollis]]'' and ''[[Crepidotus applanatus]]'' are brown-spored.

==Habitat and distribution==
'' Tectella patellaris'' is widely distributed in North America and Europe and due to its inconspicuous and unassuming presence, may be more common than is reported.<ref name="Central"/>
