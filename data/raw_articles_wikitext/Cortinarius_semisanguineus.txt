'''''Cortinarius semisanguineus''''' is a medium-sized [[mushroom]] with a pale brown to ochre [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and bright blood-red gills. It belongs to the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'', a group collectively known as webcaps. It is found growing in conifer plantations, and has recently been given the fanciful common name of '''surprise webcap'''. In the past it has been called the '''red-gilled webcap'''.

==Taxonomy==
This mushroom is placed by some authorities in the genus ''[[Dermocybe]]''. Most mycologists retain ''Dermocybe'' as merely a subgenus of ''Cortinarius''. The group contains almost 30 species. The species name ''semisanguineus'' means 'half blood-red', a reference to the [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] colour, as compared with ''[[Cortinarius sanguineus|C.&nbsp;sanguineus]]'', which is wholly blood-red.<ref name="H&R1992">{{cite book |author=Grunert |first=Helmut |title=Field Guide to MUSHROOMS of Britain and Europe |last2=Grunert |first2=Renate |publisher=The Crowood Press Ltd |year=1992 |isbn=1-85223-592-6 |edition=English}}</ref>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is campanulate (bell-shaped), and later flattens, but retains a broad umbo (shield-like central boss). It is usually between {{convert|2–5|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} across,<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=644}}</ref> brownish ochre, or umber and with a darker centre. It is covered in fine fibrils, and is dry. The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is usually the same colour as the cap or paler, and is smooth, or finely fibrillose like the cap. It is long, slim, and cylindrical. [[Partial veil|Cortinal]] remnants often left on the stem in this species can be quite fleeting. The gills are adnate, markedly sinuate, and fairly crowded. They are initially blood-red, but turn cinnamon-brown on aging, giving a [[spore print]] of the same colour.<ref name="audu" /> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is said to smell of radishes,<ref name=H&R1992/> and it is [[ochre]] in the stem, but more olive in the cap.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book|last=Phillips|first=Roger|year=2006|title=Mushrooms|publisher=[[Pan MacMillan]]|isbn=0-330-44237-6|page=205}}</ref>

''[[Cortinarius phoeniceus|C.&nbsp;phoeniceus]]'',<!-- (Vent.) Maire Bull. Fr.

==Distribution and habitat==
''Cortinarius semisanguineus'' appears in [[conifer]], or [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed conifer]], and birch woods in autumn (fall). It is occasional in [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Europe]], [[Scandinavia]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2025}} and common in parts of [[North America]].<ref name="audu" /> It has a [[mycorrhiza]]l relationship with birch trees (''[[Betula]]''), and other coniferous softwood trees. It is often abundant under young spruce in plantations on acid soil,<ref name=T.Laessoe/> appearing from September to November.<ref name="audu" />

==Edibility==
The species cannot be recommended for the table as it is suspected of being toxic; it may contain similar poisonous compounds to other species found in the ''[[Dermocybe]]'' subgenus of ''Cortinarius'', such as ''[[Cortinarius orellanus|C.&nbsp;orellanus]]'' and its close relatives.<ref name=H&R1992/><ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last=Miller Jr.|first=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=318|author-link=Orson K.
