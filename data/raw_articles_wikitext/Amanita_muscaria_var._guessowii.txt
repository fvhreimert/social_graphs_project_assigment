'''''Amanita muscaria'' var. ''guessowii''''', commonly known as the '''American yellow fly agaric''', is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus of the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. It is one of several [[Variety (botany)|varieties]] of the poisonous and psychoactive ''[[Amanita muscaria|A.&nbsp;muscaria]]'' (fly agaric).

==Description==
===Cap===
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{Convert|6-18|cm|frac=4}} wide, globose then convex, flattening in age.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=535}}</ref> It is bright yellow or yellow-orange, usually more orange or reddish orange towards the center, and fading to pale yellow.<ref name="audu" /> The [[volva (mycology)|volva]] is distributed over the cap as cream to pale tan warts; it is otherwise smooth and sticky when wet. The margin becomes slightly striate in age. The mild-smelling flesh<ref name="audu" /> is white and it does not stain when cut or injured.

===Gills===
The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free to narrowly [[wikt:adnate|adnate]], [[wikt:subcrowded|subcrowded]] to crowded, cream to pale cream, truncate, unevenly distributed, of diverse lengths, and plentiful.

===Spores===
American yellow fly agaric [[spore]]s are white in deposit, broadly ellipsoid to ellipsoid (infrequently [[wikt:subglobose|subglobose]] or elongate) and [[wikt:inamyloid|inamyloid]]. The spores are (7.0) 8.7–12.2 (14.8) x (5.9) 6.5–8.2 (9.5) [[μm]]. The [[spore print]] is white.<ref name="audu" />

===Stipe===
The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 7–16 cm long and 1–3&nbsp;cm thick,<ref name="audu" /> more or less equal or narrowing upwards and slightly flaring at the apex. It is white to yellowish cream, densely stuffed with a pith, the skirt-like ring is membranous, persistent, the lower stipe and upper bulb are decorated with tufts of volval material<ref name="audu" /> that are bright pale yellow to cream or sordid cream.

===Microscopic features===
Clamps are present at bases of the [[basidia]].

==Distribution and habitat==
American yellow fly agaric is found growing solitary or [[wiktionary:gregarious|gregariously]], it is [[mycorrhiza]]l with [[conifers]] mostly but also [[deciduous trees]] as well, it is found often in the fall but sometimes in the spring, common in the northeast, from eastern Canada to North Carolina, northwest Florida, and west to Michigan.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.shroomery.org/10224/Hunting-Fly-Agarics-in-North-America |title = Shroomery - Hunting Fly Agarics in North America}}</ref>

==Toxicity==

''Amanita muscaria'' is in general [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]]<span data-darkreader-inline-color="">, and historically was considered deadly, although possibly in error.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mushroom poisoning syndromes |url=http://www.namyco.org/toxicology/poison_syndromes.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090404122352/http://www.namyco.org/toxicology/poison_syndromes.html |archive-date=4 April 2009 |access-date=2009-03-22 |work=North American Mycological Association (NAMA) website |publisher=NAMA}}</ref></span> U<span data-darkreader-inline-color="">nless consumed to the same deadly extent applying to any poisonous mushroom, it will probably only produce [[nausea]] and/or vomiting,<ref name="Arora">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/228/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=894 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> but medical treatment may be required.<ref name="Tupalska-Wilczyńska">{{cite journal |last1=Tupalska-Wilczyńska |first1=Krystyna |last2=Ignatowicz |first2=Roman |last3=Poziemski |first3=Andrzej |last4=Wójcik |first4=Halina |last5=Wilczyński |first5=Grzegorz |year=1996 |title=Zatrucia muchomorami plamistym i czerwonym—patogeneza, objawy, leczenie |trans-title=Poisoning with spotted and red mushrooms—pathogenesis, symptoms, treatment |journal=Wiadomosci Lekarskie |language=pl |volume=49 |issue=1–6 |pages=66–71 |pmid=9173659}}</ref> It contains the toxins [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]] and likely others.<ref name="Arora" /></span>

==Psychoactivity==
{{Main articles|Muscimol mushroom}}

Ibotenic acid and muscimol are both psychoactive constituents which can cause effects such as [[hallucination]]s, [[Synesthesia|synaesthesia]], [[euphoria]], [[dysphoria]] and [[retrograde amnesia]]. The effects of muscimol and ibotenic acid most closely resemble that of any GABAergic compound but with a dissociative effect taking place in low to mid doses which are followed by delirium and vivid hallucinations at high doses.

Ibotenic acid is mostly broken down into the body to muscimol, but what remains of the ibotenic acid is believed<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stebelska |first1=Katarzyna |title=Fungal Hallucinogens Psilocin, Ibotenic Acid, and Muscimol |url=https://journals.lww.com/drug-monitoring/Abstract/2013/08000/Fungal_Hallucinogens_Psilocin,_Ibotenic_Acid,_and.2.aspx#ContentAccessOptions |journal=Therapeutic Drug Monitoring |year=2013 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=420–442 |doi=10.1097/FTD.0b013e31828741a5 |pmid=23851905 |s2cid=44494685 |access-date=4 March 2023|url-access=subscription }}</ref> to cause the majority of dysphoric effects of consuming ''A. muscaria'' mushrooms. Ibotenic acid is also a scientifically important [[neurotoxin]] used in lab research as a brain-lesioning agent in mice.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Becker |first1=A |last2=Grecksch |first2=G |last3=Bernstein |first3=HG |last4=Höllt |first4=V |last5=Bogerts |first5=B |year=1999 |title=Social behaviour in rats lesioned with ibotenic acid in the hippocampus: quantitative and qualitative analysis |journal=Psychopharmacology |volume=144 |issue=4 |pages=333–8 |doi=10.1007/s002130051015 |pmid=10435405 |s2cid=25172395}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Isacson |first1=O |last2=Brundin |first2=P |last3=Kelly |first3=PA |last4=Gage |first4=FH |last5=Björklund |first5=A |year=1984 |title=Functional neuronal replacement by grafted striatal neurones in the ibotenic acid-lesioned rat striatum |journal=Nature |volume=311 |issue=5985 |pages=458–60 |bibcode=1984Natur.311..458I |doi=10.1038/311458a0 |pmid=6482962 |s2cid=4342937}}</ref>

As with other wild-growing mushrooms, the ratio of ibotenic acid to muscimol depends on countless external factors such as season, age, and habitat. Percentages vary between specimens.{{Citation needed|date=March 2025}}
