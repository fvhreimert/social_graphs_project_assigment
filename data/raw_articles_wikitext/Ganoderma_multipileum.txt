'''''Ganoderma multipileum''''', commonly known as '''lingzhi''' or '''chizhi''', is a species of [[polypore]] mushroom.

Formerly known as ''Ganoderma lucidum'', [[phylogenetic]] analyses published in 2009 revealed that ''G.&nbsp;lucidum'' is primarily a European species, and that the name has been incorrectly applied to Asian collections.<ref name="Wang2009">{{cite journal |vauthors=Wang DM, Wu SH, Su CH, Peng JT, Shih YH, Chen LC |year=2009 |title=''Ganoderma multipileum'', the correct name for ''G. lucidum'' in tropical Asia |journal=Botanical Studies |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=451–58}}</ref>
