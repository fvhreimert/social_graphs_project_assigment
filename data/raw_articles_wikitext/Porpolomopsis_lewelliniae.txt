'''''Porpolomopsis lewelliniae''''', commonly known as the '''mauve splitting wax-cap''',  is a [[Agaricales|gilled]] [[fungus]] of the [[Hygrophoraceae|waxcap]] family found in wet forests of eastern Australia and New Zealand. The small mauve- or lilac-coloured mushrooms are fairly common and appear in moss or leaf litter on the forest floor in autumn, and are biotrophic. The key distinguishing feature is the splitting of the cap dividing down the middle of the individual gills.

==Taxonomy==
It was initially described as ''Hygrophorus lewelliniae'' by Hungarian mycologist [[Károly Kalchbrenner]] in 1882,<ref name="kalchbrenner"/> and later as ''Hygrocybe lewelliniae'' by Brittlebank in 1940, before being placed in the genus ''[[Humidicutis]]'' by Australian mycologist [[Anthony M. Young|Tony Young]] in 1997.<ref name="Young 1997"/> Kalchbrenner named this species in honour of the collector of the type specimen, [[Madeline Lewellin]].<ref>{{CiteQ|Q101072613|author1=Maroske, Sara|author2=Vaughan, Alison}}</ref> A molecular phylogenetics study found it to be more closely related to the type species of the genus ''[[Porpolomopsis]]'', ''[[Porpolomopsis calyptriformis]]'' so it was transferred to ''Porpolomopsis''.<ref name="Lodge 2014"/> The original [[holotype]] specimen had been collected on 14 June 1880 in the vicinity of [[Western Port]] in Victoria by a Miss M.R.&nbsp;Lewellin and sent by [[Ferdinand von Mueller]] to Kalchbrenner in Budapest. It was likely destroyed in the [[First World War]],<ref>Young, p. 9</ref> although a watercolour of it by the collector survives and is located in the [[National Herbarium of Victoria]]. It has been compared with collections made by [[E. J. H. Corner]] of a ''Mycena rimosacuta'' in [[Borneo]] and found to be the same species.<ref name="Young 2002"/> It may be that ''[[Humidicutis mavis]]'' is merely a white-coloured form of this species.<ref name=Young44/>

==Description==
The mauve splitting waxcap is a small mushroom with an umbonate [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] 3–6.5&nbsp;centimetres (1{{frac|1|3}}–2{{frac|1|2}} in)  in diameter, initially conical and later flattening to almost flat. It is smooth and mauve or lilac in colour with a greyish boss. The cap is textured with radial fibres, along which it may split, with the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] dividing between the split. The lilac [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 3–7&nbsp;cm (1{{frac|1|3}}–2{{frac|1|2}} in) high and 0.4–0.8&nbsp;cm thick and may be tinged yellow at the base. The lilac gills are adnexed or free, and thick or distant with even margins. The [[spore print]] is white and the [[hyaline]] [[basidiospore|spores]] are more or less oval, measuring around 5.5 x 9&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name=Young42/>

==Distribution and habitat==
Saprotrophic, this species is fairly common.<ref name ="fungimap"/> Fruiting bodies appear in autumn and winter (March to August) with some records from October, in moss or among leaf litter in wet [[sclerophyll forest]] or [[rainforest]] in [[temperate]], [[subtropical]] or [[tropical]] climates. It also appears in sandy areas.<ref name ="fungimap"/> It has been recorded from southeastern Queensland, eastern [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]], as well as New Zealand and from [[Mount Kinabalu]] in [[Sabah]]. Although not recorded from North Queensland, it is predicted to occur there.<ref name=Young42/>
