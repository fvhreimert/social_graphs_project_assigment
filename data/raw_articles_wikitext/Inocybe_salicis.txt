'''''Inocybe salicis''''' is an uncommon species of [[fungus]] found in association with [[willow]] in Europe. The species produces small, brown or yellow [[mushroom]]s with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|2.5|cm|in|1}} across, with [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]s up to {{convert|3.5|cm|in}} long. The species is similar in appearance to several other closely related species in the genus ''[[Inocybe]]'' that also associate with willow, and so is most reliably differentiated microscopically.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
''Inocybe salicis'' was [[species description|described and named]] by [[Robert Kühner]] in 1955 in the ''Bulletin Trimestriel de la Société Mycologique de France''.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.indexfungorum.org/names/NamesRecord.asp?RecordID=282702|title= ''Inocybe salicis''|publisher= [[Index Fungorum]].

International Mycological Association|access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> ''Inocybe straminipes'' is a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''I.&nbsp;salicis''. The former was originally described in 1979 by [[Henri Romagnesi]], and had different [[spore]]s from those of ''I.&nbsp;salicis''. However, the [[holotype]] was reexamined in 2009 by Ukka Vauras and Katri Kokkonen, who observed that the spores were in fact identical to those of ''I.&nbsp;salicis'', which was described earlier, and so had precedence.<ref name="Vauras">{{cite journal|last1= Vauras|first1= Ukka|last2= Kokkonen|first2= Katri|year= 2009|title= Finnish records on the genus ''Inocybe''. The new species ''Inocybe saliceticola''|journal= Karstenia|volume= 48|issue= 2|pages= 57–67 [66]|doi= 10.29203/ka.2009.429|doi-access= free}}</ref> The [[Botanical name|specific epithet]] ''salicis'' is in reference to ''[[Salix]]'', the generic name for willow.

Within the genus ''Inocybe'', ''I.&nbsp;salicis'' belongs to the section ''Marginatae'', which also includes ''[[Inocybe obtusiuscula|I.&nbsp;obtusiuscula]]'', ''[[Inocybe dunensis|I.&nbsp;dunensis]]'', ''[[Inocybe salicis-herbaceae|I.&nbsp;salicis-herbaceae]]'', ''[[Inocybe substellata|I.&nbsp;substellata]]'', ''[[Inocybe praetervisa|I.&nbsp;praetervisa]]'', ''[[Inocybe saliceticola|I.&nbsp;saliceticola]]'' and ''[[Inocybe mixtilis|I.&nbsp;mixtilis]]''. These species are all known to associate with willow, and all have macroscopic similarities. As such, they are best differentiated microscopically.<ref name="Vauras"/>

''Inocybe salicis'' mushrooms have [[tawny (color)|tawny]] to yellowish-brown [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of between {{convert|1|and|2.5|cm|in|1}} in diameter. Their surface can be cracked, covered in fibres or scaly. The caps change in shape as the mushrooms mature; while younger specimens have campanulate (bell-shaped) to conical caps, the caps of older specimens expand and flatten, with a broad [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] emerging. The [[cap cuticle]] forms a cutis. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are almost free, meaning that they only just connect to the stem, and are initially a pale grey, becoming an ochre-grey (or brownish) as they age. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] has a white to honey-coloured surface entirely covered in powdery granules. The stem is {{convert|1.5|to|3.5|cm|in|1}} long by {{convert|0.4|to|1|cm|in|1}} thick. There is a well-defined "bulb" at the base of the stem. The white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] smells spermatic, but the scent is not distinctive.<ref name="Collins1999">{{cite book |title= A Photographic Guide to the Mushrooms of Britain and Europe|last= Courtecuisee|first= Régis|year= 1999|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|isbn= 9780002200127|page= 520}}</ref>

===Microscopic characteristics===
''Inocybe salicis'' produces [[spores]] of 9 to 11 by 6 to 8&nbsp;[[micrometers]] (μm). In shape, they are elongated or curved, but they are covered with 10 to 15 distinctive blunt, semi-circular projections. The [[cystidia]] on the face and edge of the gills measure 50 to 70 by 12 to 25&nbsp;μm with a [[cell wall]] 2 to 3&nbsp;μm thick, and either taper at each end, or are shaped like swollen bottles, with the cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) more variable. The circumcystidia (cystidia on the margin of the cap) are club- or balloon-shaped, and caulocystidia can be found all the way down the stem.<ref name="Collins1999"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Inocybe salicis'' favours wet land in [[willow]] woodland and clearings. Although widespread throughout its range in Europe, it is not commonly encountered.<ref name="Collins1999"/>
