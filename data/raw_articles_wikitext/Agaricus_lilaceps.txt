'''''Agaricus lilaceps''''', also known as the '''cypress agaricus''' or the '''giant cypress agaricus''' is a species of fungus. Aside from size, the mushroom is characterized by its robust stature. It is [[Edible mushroom|edible]].

== Description ==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{Convert|7–25|cm|frac=2}} broad, convex, and expands to nearly plane.<ref name="Arora1986" /> As it ages, the disc sometimes depresses. The margin, however, is incurved, although it decurves at maturity. The surface of the cap is at first pallid to cream-buff, especially when developing below ground, but soon becomes appressed and fibrillose-squamose. In addition, it varies from brown, hazel-brown, dull chestnut-brown, and occasionally lilac-brown, although it darkens as it ages. At times, the surface develops orange-brown, rufescent areas. The context is thick, very firm, white, and slowly turns [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] when cut or bruised. The odor is that of a typical mushroom, although it tastes mild.<ref>Hotson, J. W. & [[Daniel Elliot Stuntz|D. E. Stuntz]] (1938). The genus ''Agaricus'' in western Washington. ''Mycologia'' '''30''': 204–234.</ref>

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free, close, moderately broad, and dingy-pink when young. However, when bruised, it turns reddish-brown slowly, and dark chocolate-brown at maturity.<ref>Kerrigan, R. W., P. Callac, M. P. Challen & L. A. Parra (2005). ''Agaricus'' section Xanthodermatei: a phylogenetic reconstruction with commentary on taxa. ''Mycologia'' '''97''': 1292–1315.</ref>

The [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is 5–22&nbsp;cm long, 3–6&nbsp;cm thick, and equal to [[clavate]].<ref name="Arora1986" /> The core of the stem is stuffed, while the surface is dry and white with scattered [[fibrils]] at the apex. However, the base is a discoloring dingy brownish-red to ochraceous. Also, the stipe can be smooth to patchy fibrillose below.<ref>Zeller, S.M. (1938). New or Noteworthy Agarics from the Pacific Coast States. ''Mycologia'' '''30''': 468–474.</ref> There is a partial white veil that is membranous, thick, and elastic. The upper surface is wrinkled, while the lower surface is more or less smooth, occasionally cracking and forming patches. Also, the lower surface sometimes yellows in age or when bruised, forming a superior, pendulous annulus at maturity. The stipe gradually becomes blackish from adhering spores.<ref name="Kerrigan1985">Kerrigan, R. W. (1985). Studies in ''Agaricus'' II: ''Agaricus lilaceps'' re-evaluated. ''[[Mycologia]]'' '''77''': 137–141.</ref>

The [[spore]]s are 5–6.5 by 4–5&nbsp;[[μm]], elliptical, and smooth. The [[spore print]] is dark-brown.<ref name="Arora1986" />

=== Identification ===
''A. lilaceps'' can be distinguished from its relatives by its size, robust stature, reddening flesh, and the stipe which is often club-shaped.<ref name="Kerrigan1985" /><ref name="Arora1986" />

== Habitat and distribution ==
''Agaricus lilaceps'' are scattered or clustered under [[Monterey Cypress]] (''Cupressus macrocarpa''). They fruit from mid to late [[winter]].<ref name=Arora1986>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/323/mode/2up |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=323-24}}</ref> They are found exclusively in the central area of [[California]], though ''A.&nbsp;lilaceps'' can be found in the west in the [[Monterey Bay]] area.

== Uses ==
It is among the largest and most choice edible ''[[Agaricus]]'' species in California.<ref>Kerrigan, Richard W. (1986). The Agaricales (Gilled Fungi) of California. 6. Agaricaceae. Mad River Press: Eureka, CA. page 62</ref> It may require thorough cooking to tenderize.<ref name="Arora1986" />
