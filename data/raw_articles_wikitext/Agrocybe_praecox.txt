'''''Agrocybe praecox''''', commonly known as the '''spring agrocybe''', '''early agrocybe''',<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/469/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=469-70 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> or '''spring fieldcap''', is a species of fungus. According to modern analysis, it is one of a cluster of closely similar species, known as the ''A.&nbsp;praecox'' complex.

It appears early in the year in woods, gardens, and fields in Eurasia, North Africa, and North America. It is of debatable culinary interest.

== Taxonomy ==
The mushroom was first described by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] in 1800 as ''Agaricus praecox''. In 1889, [[Victor Fayod]] devised the new genus ''Agrocybe'' and made ''A.&nbsp;praecox'' the [[type species]].<ref name="IF" />

A 1990 study by Timothy Flynn and O.&nbsp;K. Miller finds that ''A.&nbsp;praecox'' is one of four species which are indistinguishable using superficial characteristics but which can be separated through their habitat and location.<ref name="FlynnMiller" /><ref name="Kuo" /> If this proposal is accepted, the cluster consists of ''A.&nbsp;molesta'' and three other species which do not yet have proper names, but which are referred to as "Flynn & Miller Species I–III".  The three provisional species correspond to the older names ''A.&nbsp;acericola'', ''A.&nbsp;elatella'', ''A.&nbsp;praecox'', and ''A.&nbsp;sphaleromorpha'' combined; and their synonyms.<ref name="FN" /><ref name="ChampQuebec" />  According to the traditional system, various detailed morphological characteristics can be used to choose between the species, but such is variation amongst individuals that it is difficult to achieve a consistent identification in this way.

The Latin [[epithet]] ''praecox'' ('early')<ref name=":0">{{cite book |last1=Trudell |first1=Steve |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC |title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest |last2=Ammirati |first2=Joe |publisher=[[Timber Press]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-88192-935-5 |series=Timber Press Field Guides |location=Portland, OR |pages=178–179}}</ref> is related to the word "precocious" and refers to the fact that this species often appears early in the year.

== Description ==
''Agrocybe praecox'' belongs to a group of species which are difficult to distinguish consistently.<ref name="Bon" /><ref name="Courtecuisse" /><ref name="FN" /><ref name="Moser" />

The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is up to {{Convert|10|cm|abbr=off|sp=us|frac=2}} wide,<ref name="Arora1986" /> bun-shaped and brownish then convex and lightening to tannish<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=663}}</ref> (beige when dry and yellowish-brown when moist), and smooth. [[Veil (mycology)|Veil]] remnants are often visible around the rim.<ref name="audu" /> The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are initially pale grayish, later brown.<ref name="audu" /> The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is pale, {{Convert|4 to 12|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long and up to about 2&nbsp;cm thick, with a fragile ring. They often have white [[mycelial cords]] at the base.<ref name="audu" /> The odor and taste are floury.<ref name="Courtecuisse" /><ref name="FN" /> The taste may be bitter.<ref name="Bon" />

The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are 8–10 x 5–7 [[μm]],<ref name="FN" /> elliptical,<ref name="Arora1986" /> and brown [[Spore print|en masse]].<ref name="audu" />

== Habitat and distribution ==
It can grow alone or gregarious in grass, compost, or on wood debris in woods and gardens.<ref name="audu" /> Like other ''Agrocybes'', it is a [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprophyte]].

It has a widespread distribution in North America<ref name="Kuo" /> (spring to summer),<ref name="audu" /> Europe, Asia,<ref name="Asef 2020">{{cite book |author=Asef M.R. |title=Field guide of Mushrooms of Iran |publisher=Iran-Shanasi Press |location=Tehran|year=2020|page=360 |isbn=978-600-8351-42-9}}</ref> and North Africa.<ref name="Courtecuisse" />  Also it has been reported from Mongolia, Siberia, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Argentina and Colombia.<ref name="GBIF" />
