'''''Hebeloma aminophilum''''', commonly known as the '''ghoul fungus''', is a species of [[mushroom]] in the family [[Hymenogastraceae]]. Found in [[Western Australia]], it gets its [[common name]] from the propensity of the [[basidiocarp|fruiting bodies]] to spring out of decomposing animal remains.

==Taxonomy==
The ghoul fungus was first [[species description|described]] by mycologists R.N. Hilton and [[Orson K. Miller, Jr.]] in 1987.<ref name="Miller 1986"/> The [[holotype]] collection consisted of about 100 specimens that were fruiting around the bones of a decomposing [[kangaroo]] carcass that had been dumped some months before.<ref name="Miller 1986" />

=== Etymology ===
The generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''Hebe'', "youth", and  -''loma'', a fringe (pertaining to the fungal [[Veil (botany)|veil]]), referring to how the fungal veil is only seen in immature specimens.<ref>[http://www.britmycolsoc.org.uk/files/HFSG_News_Autumn2006.pdf Herefordshire Fungus Survey Group, News Sheet No 12: Autumn 2006]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It gets its common name of ghoul fungus from its habit of growing around animal carcasses.<ref name="Bougher98">{{cite book |title=Fungi of Southern Australia|author=Bougher NL, Syme K. |year=1998|pages=274–75|publisher=[[University of Western Australia]] Press |location=Nedlands, WA |isbn=978-1-875560-80-6}}</ref>

==Description==
The dull pinkish brown or cream [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|3|–|11|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} in diameter, convex initially before flattening out with age. There is a slight [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], and the cap margin is inrolled when young. A thin white veil rapidly disappears in young mushrooms. The cap surface is sticky initially. The adnate (or sometimes adnexed) gills are pale pink to pinkish brown and up to 1&nbsp;cm deep. With age, they can be encrusted with clumps of spores. The cylindrical [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|6.5|–|9|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} high, 1–1.2&nbsp;cm in diameter and has a thickened base and lacks a ring. The thick [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is cream or pale yellow, with a bitter taste and a stale smell. The [[spore print]] is pinkish brown, and the oval spores measure 8.5 by 4.9&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The [[mycelium]] is white.<ref name="Bougher98"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
An uncommon fungus, ''H. aminophilum'' is found in southern Western Australia, southeastern South Australia and Victoria.<ref name ="fungimap"/> Fruiting bodies arise in [[eucalyptus]] woodland in the vicinity of sheep, reptile and bird carcasses.<ref name ="fungimap"/> The habit of growing from flesh gives it the term sarcophilous.<ref name="Bougher98"/>
