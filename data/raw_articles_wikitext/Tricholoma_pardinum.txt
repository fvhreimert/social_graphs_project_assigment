'''''Tricholoma pardinum''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as '''spotted tricholoma''', '''tiger tricholoma''', '''tigertop''', '''leopard knight''', or '''dirty trich''', is a species of [[Agaricales|gilled mushroom]]. First officially described by [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801, it has had a confusing [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history that extends over two centuries. In 1762, German naturalist [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] described the species ''Agaricus tigrinus'' with an illustration corresponding to what is thought to be ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'', and consequently, the name ''Tricholoma tigrinum'' has been used erroneously in some European field guides.

The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of ''Tricholoma pardinum'' is an imposing mushroom with a pale grey [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] up to {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter that is covered with dark brownish to greyish scales. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are whitish, and are not attached to the stout white to pale grey-brown [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]]. The [[spore print]] is white.

It is widely distributed across North America, Europe, and parts of Asia. It is generally found in [[beech]] woodland in summer and autumn. One of the more toxic members of the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]'', the species has been implicated in a number of episodes of [[mushroom poisoning]], probably because it is a large, attractive mushroom with a pleasant smell and taste, and resembles several [[edible mushroom|edible]] species. Ingesting it—even in small quantities—results in a severe, persistent [[gastroenteritis]] caused by an unknown [[mycotoxin]].

==Taxonomy==



The German naturalist [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] published ''Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur Icones'' in 1762,<ref name=Schaffer1762/> in which he described a mushroom he called ''Agaricus tigrinus''. The illustration accompanying the name fits what we now know as ''Tricholoma pardinum''; the description is less clear.<ref name=Riva1988/> [[Elias Magnus Fries]] used the name ''Agaricus tigrinus'' in his 1821 work ''[[Systema Mycologicum]]'',<ref name=Fries1821/> in accordance with Bulliard's 1782 description, which now corresponds with ''[[Lentinus tigrinus]]''.<ref name=Riva1988/> [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]] described this species as ''Agaricus myomyces'' var. ''pardinus'' in 1801, but queried whether it was a distinct species.<ref name=Persoon1801/> In his 1838 work ''Epicrisis systematis mycologici: seu synopsis hymenomycetum'', Fries assigned a different fungus again to the binomial name and linked it to Schäffer's 1762 description.<ref name=Fries1838/> French mycologist [[Lucien Quélet]] reclassified it as a species in 1873, giving it its current [[binomial name]].<ref name=Quelet1873/> Italian mycologist Alfredo Riva has noted that Swiss mycologist [[Louis Secretan]] provided a description forty years before Quélet, in his 1833 work ''Mycographie Suisse'',<ref name=Secretan1833/> and queried why it was ignored. He has proposed the fungus be written as ''Tricholoma pardinum'' (Secr.) Quél.<ref name=Riva1988/> Secretan's works are generally not recognised for [[nomenclature|nomenclatural]] purposes because he did not use [[binomial nomenclature]] consistently.<ref name=Donk1962/><ref name=Demoulin1974/>

There has been confusion over which scientific name to use for over two hundred years.<ref name=Riva1988/> ''[[Tricholoma tigrinum]]'' has been used in some European field guides,<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/><ref name=North1967/> but has been applied in error to this species.<ref name=Bas1999/><ref name=Smith1944/> The uncertainty was such that Czech mycologists Josef Herink and [[František Kotlaba]] suggested in 1967 that both are incorrect and proposed the new name ''T.&nbsp;pardalotum''.<ref name=Herink1967/>

''Tricholoma pardinum'' lies within the [[subgenus]] ''Pardinicutis'' of ''[[Tricholoma]]'', a grouping of similar species characterised by greyish, brownish, or pallid caps that are woolly or covered in small scales, [[spore]]s with a length between eight and eleven [[micrometre]]s, and abundant [[clamp connection]]s in the [[hypha]]e.<ref name=Bas1999/> [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] analyses suggest that ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'' is closely related to ''[[Tricholoma huronense|T.&nbsp;huronense]]'', ''[[Tricholoma mutabile|T.&nbsp;mutabile]]'', and ''[[Tricholoma venenatum|T.&nbsp;venenatum]]''.<ref name=Bidartondo2002/><ref name=Lim2003/> ''Tricholoma pardinum'' var. ''filamentosum'' is an uncommon [[variety (botany)|variety]], described in 1983 by Carlo Luciano Alessio, which produces mushrooms with more [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]] caps and stalks than the typical variety.<ref name=Alessio1983/> It is found in southern Europe,<ref name=Bas1999/> where it associates with [[chestnut]] and [[spruce]] trees.<ref name=Riva1988/> Another variety has been described as ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'' var. ''unguentatum'', characterised by daintier mushrooms that have a greasy coating on their caps.<ref name=Riva1988/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''pardinum'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''pardus'' "leopard",<ref name=Simpson1979/><ref>{{L&S|pardus|ref}}</ref> referring to its [[mottle]]d or spotted [[pileus (mycology)|cap]].<ref name=Trudell2009/> The [[genus|generic]] name derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|θρίξ}} ''thrix'' "hair" (<small>[[Genitive case|GEN]]</small> {{lang|grc|τριχός}} ''trichos'') and {{lang|grc|λῶμα}} ''lōma'' "hem", "fringe", or "border".<ref name=Nilsson1977/><ref>{{LSJ|qri/c|θρίξ}}, {{LSJ|lw{{=}}ma|λῶμα|ref}}</ref> [[Common name]]s include striped tricholoma,<ref name=Lamaison2005/> spotted tricholoma,<ref name=North1967/> tiger tricholoma,<ref name=Arora1986/> poison trich,<ref name=Lincoff2008/> leopard knight,<ref name=EnglishCommonNames/> and tigertop.<ref name="usfda"/> Dirty trich was a name coined by author Gary H. Lincoff in response to a publisher's request for a more accessible name than its binomial one for North American guidebooks.<ref name=Bakaitis2003/>

Two [[subspecies]] have been described from southern Europe.{{Citation needed|date=May 2025}}

The stout stalk may be white, pale grey or pale brown, and is thicker at the base.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> The texture of the stalk surface ranges from fibrillose (appearing to be made of coarse fibres arranged longitudinally) to more or less smooth, and the stalk base will stain dirty brown to yellow when bruised.<ref name=Bas1999/><ref name=Ammirati1985/> It is {{convert|3|–|12|cm|in|abbr=on|round=0.5}} high and {{convert|1.5|–|3|cm|in|abbr=on|round=0.5}} wide, with the base {{convert|2.5|–|4|cm|in|abbr=on|round=0.5}} in diameter,<ref name=":0" /> and bruises a dirty yellow.<ref name=Bas1999/> There is no [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] or [[volva (mycology)|volva]]. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish and has a pleasant mealy smell and taste.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> Variety ''filamentosum'' has a mealy odour and taste reminiscent of cucumber.<ref name=Riva1988/>

The [[spore print]] is white, and the oval to oblong [[Basidiospore|spores]] are 7.5–9.5&nbsp;[[μm]] long by 5.0–7.0&nbsp;μm wide.<ref name=Bas1999/> Spores are smooth, [[hyaline]] (translucent), [[nonamyloid]],<ref name=Ammirati1985/> and have a prominent [[hilum (biology)|hilum]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to club shaped, four spored, and measure 39–50 by 8.0–9.6&nbsp;μm. The [[cystidia]] present on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are thin walled, hyaline, have a short stalk and a spherical apical portion, and measure 29–41 by 12–21&nbsp;μm; cystidia are absent from the gill face.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] ranges in cellular form from a cutis (in which the [[hypha]]e are bent over, running parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (with hyphae emerging roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface); the hyphae comprising the cuticle are cylindrical, and measure 2.0–9.0&nbsp;μm wide with a club-shaped tip up to 11&nbsp;μm wide.<ref name=Bas1999/>

''Tricholoma pardinum'' mushrooms may be confused with several [[edible mushroom|edible]] grey-capped members of the genus ''Tricholoma'', and some authorities recommend leaving all grey-capped ''Tricholoma'' mushrooms for experienced [[Mushroom hunting|hunters]].<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/><ref name=Smith1980/> There are several superficially similar European species that could be mistaken for ''T.&nbsp;pardinum''. The smaller ''[[Tricholoma terreum|T.&nbsp;terreum]]'' lacks a mealy smell and cap scales,<ref name=Haas1969/> is darker and less robust, and has smaller spores measuring 5.0–7.5 by 4.0–5.0&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Roody2003/> The edible ''[[Tricholoma argyraceum|T.&nbsp;argyraceum]]'' somewhat resembles ''T.&nbsp;pardinum''—but with finer scales,<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> and gills and bruised parts that yellow with age. Unlike the preferentially montane ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'', these lookalikes tend to fruit at lower elevations.<ref name=Lemesle/> ''[[Tricholoma atrosquamosum|T.&nbsp;atrosquamosum]]'' is smaller and darker than ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'', and has a peppery aroma.<ref name=Riva1988/> ''[[Tricholoma orirubens|T.&nbsp;orirubens]]'' has fine dark scales and pinkish gills,<ref name=Haas1969/> brittle flesh, and is generally smaller.<ref name=Lemesle/> ''[[Tricholoma myomyces|T.&nbsp;myomyces]]'' is smaller than ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'', has a thin, fibrous partial veil on young specimens, and elliptical spores measuring 5.0–6.0 by 3.5–4.0&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Miller2006/> The edible and highly regarded ''[[Tricholoma portentosum|T.&nbsp;portentosum]]'' is of a similar size, though has a uniform grey cap that is never scaled.<ref name=Lamaison2005/>

In North America, ''Tricholoma pardinum'' can be confused with ''[[Tricholoma nigrum|T.&nbsp;nigrum]]'' and forms of ''[[Tricholoma virgatum|T.&nbsp;virgatum]]'' that have more streaked rather than spotted caps.<ref name=Trudell2009/> A form of ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'' in North America can be nearly white with pale scales, and may be confused with the whitish edible species ''[[Tricholoma resplendens|T.&nbsp;resplendens]]''.<ref name=Arora1986/> Microscopically, the presence of clamp connections sets ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'' apart from most other members of the genus; the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) ''[[Tricholoma venenatum|T.&nbsp;venenatum]]'' also has them.<ref name=Trudell2009/> According to [[Alexander H. Smith]], ''[[Tricholoma huronense|T.&nbsp;huronense]]'' is closely related, but can be distinguished from ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'' by its narrower gills, its tendency to form drops of reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and scaly stalk surface.<ref name=Smith1944/> [[Tricholoma atroviolaceum|''T.&nbsp;atroviolaceum'']] and ''[[Tricholoma imbricatum|T.&nbsp;imbricatum]]'' are also similar.<ref name=":0" />

==Distribution and habitat==

''Tricholoma pardinum'' is found across Europe, where it is more common in the south.<ref name=Bas1999/> It is abundant in the [[Jura Mountains]] in eastern France.<ref name=Lamaison2005/> The species is found in Belgium and Germany, but has not been recorded from the Netherlands or the British Isles.<ref name=North1967/><ref name=Bas1999/> A historical record from Estonia has been discarded because no [[herbarium]] specimens could be found.<ref name=Kalamees2010/> In Asia, it has been recorded from [[İzmir Province]] in southwestern Turkey,<ref name=Solak1999/> China,<ref name="china"/> and [[Sado, Niigata|Sado Island]] in Japan.<ref name=Miyauchi1997/> It is found widely across [[temperate]] North America,<ref name=Ammirati1985/> where [[Santa Cruz County, California|Santa Cruz County]] and [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in central [[California]] in the west of the continent,<ref name=Fuller1986/> and the central [[Appalachians]] in the east form the southern limits of its distribution.<ref name=Roody2003/> ''T.&nbsp;pardinum'' is commonly associated with [[conifer]]s in the [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Pacific Northwest]], and with tanoak (''[[Lithocarpus densiflorus]]'') and madrone (''[[Arbutus]]'' spp.) in California. The mushroom can be abundant in some years, especially warmer years with higher rainfall,<ref name=Smith1980/> yet missing or rare for several years in between.<ref name=Arora1986/> In Europe, it is found on chalky soil in woodland with [[beech]] and [[fir]] in summer and autumn,<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> where it prefers areas of some elevation.<ref name=Lamaison2005/> Although it may be found in groups or [[fairy ring]]s,<ref name=Lamaison2005/> it most commonly occurs singly.<ref name=Pilat1961/>

==Toxicity==

''Tricholoma pardinum'' is one of several [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] members of the genus ''Tricholoma''; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant smell and taste add to the risk of its being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for more than twenty percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in Switzerland in the first half of the 20th century.<ref name=Alder1960/> Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains.<ref name=Lamaison2005/> Eating it causes highly unpleasant [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s of [[nausea]], [[dizziness]], [[vomiting]], and [[diarrhea]].<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> These arise fifteen minutes to two hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes four to six days. [[Sweating]] and [[anxiety]] may be evident, and disturbance in [[liver]] function has been recorded.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> Cramping may occur in the calves.<ref name=Lemesle/> In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown,<ref>Benjamin, pp. 370–71.</ref> appears to cause a sudden [[inflammation]] of the [[mucous membrane]]s lining the stomach and intestines.<ref name=Pilat1961/>

These symptoms may be severe enough to warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; [[antispasmodic]] medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and [[Activated carbon#Medical applications|activated charcoal]] may be administered early on to bind residual toxin. [[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous fluids]] may be required if [[dehydration]] has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly.<ref>Benjamin, pp. 354–55.</ref> Once gastric contents are emptied, [[metoclopramide]] may be used in cases of recurrent vomiting.<ref>Benjamin, p. 188.</ref>
