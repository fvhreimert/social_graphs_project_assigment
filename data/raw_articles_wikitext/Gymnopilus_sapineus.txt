The small mushroom has a rusty orange [[spore print]] and a bitter taste. It grows on dead [[conifer]] wood throughout North America.

}}</ref> This is further complicated by the macroscopic morphological and ecological similarities between members of the ''G.&nbsp;sapineus'' complex such as ''G.&nbsp;penetrans'' and ''G.&nbsp;nevadensis''. Michael Kuo explicates upon this by speaking of the arbitrary distinction made between ''G.&nbsp;sapineus'' and ''G.&nbsp;penetrans'' made by [[Elias Magnus Fries]].<ref name="ME">[http://www.mushroomexpert.com/gymnopilus_sapineus.html ''Gymnopilus sapineus'' at MushroomExpert]</ref> He at first labeled ''G.&nbsp;penetrans'' to merely be a form of ''G.&nbsp;sapineus'' in 1815, but then recanted and labeled them separate in 1821.

==Description==

The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|2|–|8|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=8}} across, is convex to flat, and is golden-yellow to brownish orange,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=246–247|oclc=797915861}}</ref> darker at the center with a dry scaly surface which is often fibrillose and may have [[wikt:squamule|squamules]]. The cap margin is inrolled at first and curves outward as it matures, becoming almost plane and sometimes developing fibrillose cracks in age.<ref name=":0" /> The flesh is yellow<ref name=":0" /> to orange and delicate when compared to larger and firmer members of ''Gymnopilus'', such as ''[[Gymnopilus junonius|G.&nbsp;junonius]]''.

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are crowded, yellow at first, turning rusty orange as the spores mature, with [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] attachment.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=653}}</ref> The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are rusty orange<ref name=":0" /> to rusty brown, elliptical, rough, and 7–10 x 4–6&nbsp;[[μm]].

The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|3|–|7|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=8}} long and 0.5–1 cm thick.<ref name=":0" /> It has either an equal structure, or becomes thinner near the base. It is light yellow, bruising rusty brown. The stipe has an evanescent [[veil (botany)|veil]] which often leaves fragments on the upper part of the stipe<ref name=":0" /> or the margin of young caps.

The species sometimes tastes bitter, and has a mild,<ref name=":0" /> fungoid or sweet smell. It is nonpoisonous, but considered inedible.<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=296|author-link1=Orson K.

It does not stain blue and lacks the hallucinogen [[psilocybin]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2025}}

=== Similar species ===
This mushroom is often mistaken for ''[[Gymnopilus luteocarneus|G. luteocarneus]]'' which grows on conifers and has a smoother and darker cap.  Another lookalike is ''[[Gymnopilus penetrans|G. penetrans]]'' which grows in the same habitat and has minor microscopic differences.<ref name="ME" />

Other similar species include ''[[Gymnopilus aeruginosus|G. aeruginosus]]'', ''[[Gymnopilus luteofolius|G. luteofolius]]'',<ref name=":0" /> and ''[[Gymnopilus hybridus|G. hybridus]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=182}}</ref> It can also resemble members of ''[[Pholiota]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius]]'' section ''Callistei''.<ref name="audu" />

==Habitat and distribution==
''G. sapineus'' can be found on rotting wood under [[conifer]] trees throughout North America, generally from June to September, or September to February on the West Coast.<ref name="audu" />
