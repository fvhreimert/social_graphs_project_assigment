'''''Hygrocybe austropratensis''''' is a [[Agaricales|gilled]] [[fungus]] of the [[Hygrophoraceae|waxcap]] family found in a few scattered locations in dry [[sclerophyll]] forests in [[eastern Australia]]. It is a small [[mushroom]] with a 1.4–3&nbsp;cm diameter pale orange or orange-brown [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] and buff-coloured [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] and [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. It is known only from near Sydney, [[Hazelbrook, New South Wales|Hazelbrook]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

==Taxonomy==
''Hygrocybe austropratensis'' was originally collected by [[mycology|mycologist]] [[Bruce A. Fuhrer]] in [[Warrandyte State Park]] in [[Melbourne]]'s outer northeastern suburbs on 23 May 1996, and officially described by Australian mycologist [[Anthony M. Young|Tony Young]] in 1999, from a designated [[holotype]] collected by Ray and Elma Kearney in [[Lane Cove Bushland Park]] in Sydney's suburban [[Lower North Shore (Sydney)|Lower North Shore]] district on 7 June 1996.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Young AM, Wood AE |year=1999|title=The Hygrocybeae (Fungi, Homobasidiomycetes, Agaricales, Hygrophoraceae) of [[Lane Cove Bushland Park]], New South Wales |journal= Austrobaileya |volume=5 |pages=546}}</ref> Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is made with the prefix ''austro-'' "southern" onto the existing ''pratensis'' "of a meadow".<ref>{{cite book|author = Simpson DP| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary  | publisher = Cassell Ltd| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=0-304-52257-0}}</ref>

It was separated from the wide-ranging buffcap (''[[Hygrocybe pratensis]]'') by its smaller spores and the fine white fur that covers young mushrooms.<ref name=Young68>Young, p. 68</ref>

==Description==
''Hygrocybe austropratensis'' is a small mushroom with a pale orange to orange-brown [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] {{convert|1.4|–|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, initially convex and later flattening irregularly. All parts of the mushroom are covered with fine white down which disappears with age. The widely spaced thick [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are decurrent, and occasionally fork at the margin of the cap, and are [[buff (color)|buff]]. The buff [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|2|–|4.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} high and 0.4–0.7&nbsp;cm thick and may be bulbous at the base. The [[spore print]] is white, the oval [[basidiospore|spores]] measuring 7.5 x 6.3&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name=Young68/>

==Distribution and habitat==
Saprotrophic, this species has been recovered from locations in southeastern Australia including [[Hazelbrook, New South Wales|Hazelbrook]] in the Blue Mountains and Sydney Basin, and [[Warrandyte, Victoria|Warrandyte]] in outer Melbourne. Fruiting bodies appear in autumn and winter (May and June), in leaf litter and mossy areas in dry forest, particularly with ''[[Kunzea ericoides]]'', in warm temperate or subtropical climates.<ref name=Young68/>

It is currently listed by the [[Government of New South Wales]] as ''endangered'',<ref name=DECC/> that is "likely to become extinct unless the circumstances and factors threatening its survival or evolutionary development cease to operate" as defined by the NSW Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/legislation.aspx |title=NSW Threatened Species Legislation |access-date=16 April 2008 |work=New South Wales Government - Department of Environment and Climate Change website |archive-date=17 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217034826/http://www.threatenedspecies.environment.nsw.gov.au/tsprofile/legislation.aspx |url-status=dead }}</ref> Searching of suitable habitat has only yielded a very limited occurrence, and its habitat has been deemed vulnerable to waterborne pollution, weed encroachment and damage from pedestrians.<ref name=DECC>{{cite web |author= NSW Scientific Committee |url=http://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/determinations/HygrocybeAustropratensisEndSpListing.htm |title=''Hygrocybe austropratensis'' (an agaric fungus) - endangered species listing |access-date=25 July 2008 |work=New South Wales Government - Department of Environment and Climate Change website}}</ref>
