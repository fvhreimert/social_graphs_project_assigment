'''''Collybia cookei''''' is a [[species]] of [[fungus]] in the family [[Tricholomataceae]], and one of three species in the genus ''[[Collybia]]''. It is known from Europe, Asia, and North America. The fungus produces [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] that usually grow on the decomposing remains of other [[mushroom]]s, like ''[[Meripilus giganteus]]'', ''[[Inonotus hispidus]]'', or species of ''[[Russula]]''; occasionally fruit bodies are found on rich [[humus]] or well-decayed wood. The fungus produces small white mushrooms with [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] up to {{convert|9|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in diameter, supported by thin [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] that originate from a yellowish-brown [[sclerotium]]. The mushroom is difficult to distinguish from the other two species of ''Collybia'' unless an effort is made to examine the sclerotia, which is usually buried in the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom has not been determined.

The species was first [[species description|described]] in the scientific literature in 1928 as ''Collybia cirrhata'' var. ''cookei'' by the Italian mycologist [[Giacomo Bresadola]].<ref name=Bresadola1928/> In a 1935 publication, Jean D. Arnold reported a series of [[pure culture|cultural studies]] with monokaryon isolates ([[hypha]] having only a single [[haploid]] nucleus) of several ''[[Collybia]]'' species to determine their [[mating in fungi|mating type]]. All attempts to produce [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] between ''C.&nbsp;cirrhata'' var. ''cookei'' and ''C.&nbsp;cirrata'' or [[mycelium|mycelial]] fusions between the two species failed. This sexual incompatibility indicated that the two taxa were separate species, and she raised the taxon from [[variety (botany)|varietal]] to [[species|specific]] status, calling it ''Collybia cookei''.<ref name=Arnold1935/> The species has also been called ''Microcollybia cookei'' in a 1979 publication by Joanne Lennox,<ref name=Lennox1979/> but the genus ''Microcollybia'' has since been folded into ''Collybia''.<ref name=Kirk2008/> [[Marcel Bon]] and [[Régis Courtecuisse]] considered the species a variety of ''Collybia tuberosa'' in a 1988 publication.<ref name=Bon1988/> A 2001 [[molecular phylogenetic|molecular]] analysis based on the [[ribosomal DNA]] sequences confirmed that ''C.&nbsp;cookei'' is [[phylogenetic]]ally related to ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' and ''C.&nbsp;cirrhata'', and that the three species form a [[monophyletic]] group that comprise the genus ''Collybia''.<ref name=Hughes2001/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''cookei'' honors the British mycologist [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]].<ref name=Evenson1997/>

==Description==
, and their spacing is close to subdistant.]]
The [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of young mushrooms are roughly spherical, but soon become convex to flattened in maturity, and reach diameters of {{convert|2|–|9|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Treu1996/> The cap margin is rolled or curled inward when young, but straightens out as it matures.<ref name=Bessette2007/> The cap color is white to [[cream (color)|cream]]. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are broadly [[adnation|adnate]] to slightly [[decurrent]], with a color similar to the cap; their spacing is close to subdistant.<ref name="urlKuo"/> The whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is equal in width throughout, usually not straight but with curves, and {{convert|2|–|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.3|–|1.0|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} thick.<ref name=Treu1996/> The upper region of the stem surface can be covered with what appears to be a white powder, and there are thin hairs near the base.<ref name=Bessette2007/> The stems originate from a yellowish-brown [[sclerotium]] that is up to {{convert|6|mm|in|abbr=on}} long.<ref name=Treu1996/> The sclerotium ranges in shape from roughly spherical to almond-shaped to irregular, and its surface is often wrinkled and pitted.<ref name="urlHalling"/> The mushroom has no distinctive odor or taste, and its [[edible mushroom|edibility]] is unknown.<ref name=Bessette2007/>

In [[spore print|deposit]], the [[spore]] color is white. The spores are smooth, ellipsoidal to tear-shaped,<ref name=Bessette2007/> [[hyaline]] (translucent), not [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], and measure 3.9–5.2 by 2.6–3.3&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are four-spored and hyaline, with dimensions of 16–20 by 4–5&nbsp;μm. They have clamps at their bases. There are no [[cystidia]] on either the edges (cheilocystidia) or faces (pleurocystidia) of the gills. The arrangement of the [[hypha]]e in the [[hymenophore|hymenophoral]] tissue varies from regular to interwoven. The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is a cutis (a type of tissue where the hyphae are arranged more or less parallel to the surface), formed by hyphae with [[septum|septa]], roughly 4–9&nbsp;μm in diameter. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae. The sclerotium is made of hyphae that have yellow [[pigment]] in their walls that appear in cross-section to be [[pseudoparenchymatous]] (compactly interwoven short-celled hyphae that resemble [[parenchyma]] of higher plants), and measure 5–10&nbsp;μm in diameter.<ref name=Treu1996/>

===Similar species===

''Collybia cookei'' is most likely to be confused with the two other members of ''Collybia'', both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or debris in which the stem is embedded.<ref name=Evenson1997/> In the field, ''[[Collybia tuberosa|C.&nbsp;tuberosa]]'' may be distinguished from ''C.&nbsp;cookei'' by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed.<ref name="urlKuo"/> Using a [[optical microscope|microscope]] provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of ''C.&nbsp;cookei'' are rounded, while those of ''C.&nbsp;tuberosa'' are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species.<ref name=Komorowska2000/> ''[[Collybia cirrhata|C.&nbsp;cirrhata]]'' does not produce sclerotia.<ref name=Bessette2007/>

Another mushroom that grows on decomposing fruit bodies is ''[[Asterophora lycoperdoides]]'', which is distinct from ''C.&nbsp;cookei'' because of the powdery brown asexual spores ([[chlamydospore]]s) produced on the cap surface.<ref name=Roody2003/> [[Alexander H. Smith]] has noted a general similarity in appearance between ''C.&nbsp;cookei'' and the North American species ''[[Clitocybe sclerotoidea]]'' (then known as ''Tricholoma sclerotoideum''),<ref name=Smith1944/> which is parasitic to ''[[Helvella lacunosa]]''.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> However, ''C.&nbsp;sclerotoidea'' is larger than ''C.&nbsp;cookei'', with cap diameters up to {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and has more distantly spaced gills.<ref name=Smith1944/>

Like all members of the genus ''Collybia'', ''C.&nbsp;cookei'' grows on the well-rotted, blackened remains of mushrooms, such as species of ''[[Russula]]'',<ref name=Treu1996/> ''[[Meripilus giganteus]]'',<ref name=Veselsky1966/> and ''[[Inonotus hispidus]]''.<ref name=Noordeloos1994/> Fruit bodies occasionally grow on well-decayed wood<ref name=Bessette2007/> or rich [[humus]].<ref name=Evenson1997/> The fruit bodies grow scattered, clustered, or in groups.<ref name=Treu1996/> A [[field study]] conducted near a [[Brass mill]] in Sweden revealed that [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] contamination had little effect on the appearance of the mushroom, possibly because its [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] of partially decomposed fruit bodies has a lower metal concentration that the underlying topsoil.<ref name=Ruhling1984/>

''Collybia cookei'' is found in Europe, Asia (Japan), and North America.<ref name=Treu1996/> The European distribution extends north to the [[Arctic Circle]] and the [[Lofoten Islands]].<ref name=Papetti1999/> The species is widely distributed in North America;<ref name="urlKuo"/> it was reported from Mexico for the first time in 1998.<ref name=VillarruelOrdaz1998/> The fungus is partial to [[mixed forest]] dominated by [[aspen]] and [[conifer]]s in [[montane]] and [[subalpine]] environments.<ref name=Evenson1997/> In The Netherlands, it was a component of one of three communities of saprobic fungi associated with roadside verges (the land between the road edge and the adjacent wall, fence or hedge) planted with common oak (''[[Quercus robur]]''); the verges also supported the growth of the mushroom ''[[Russula ochroleuca]]'', a host of ''C.&nbsp;cookei''.<ref name=Keizer1994/>
