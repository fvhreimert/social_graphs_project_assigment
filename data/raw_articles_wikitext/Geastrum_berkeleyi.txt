'''''Geastrum berkeleyi''''', or '''Berkeley's earthstar''', is an inedible species of [[mushroom]] belonging to the genus ''[[Geastrum]]'', or earthstar fungi. It can be distinguished from other ''Geastrum'' species by the flat bipyramidal shape of the [[calcium oxalate]] crystals found on its [[endoperidium]].<ref name="Krisai 1986"/>

Despite being a very uncommon mushroom, it has a wide geographical distribution, having been documented in Northern and Eastern Europe as well as Eastern Asia.

European countries it is found in include [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Great Britain]], [[Hungary]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]],<ref name="Jaworska 2011"/> [[Slovakia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], and [[Turkey]]. In Asia, it can be found in [[China]] and [[Japan]].<ref name="Jaworska 2011"/>
