'''''Boletus pinophilus''''', commonly known as the '''pine bolete''' or '''pinewood king bolete''', is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus of the genus ''[[Boletus]]'' found throughout Europe and western Asia. Described by Italian naturalist [[Carlo Vittadini]] in 1835, ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' was for many years considered a [[subspecies]] or [[Form (botany)|form]] of the porcini mushroom ''[[Boletus edulis|B.&nbsp;edulis]]'' before genetic studies confirmed its distinct status. In 2008, ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' in western North America were reclassified as a new species, ''[[Boletus rex-veris|B.&nbsp;rex-veris]]''. ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' is edible, and may be preserved and cooked.

The fungus grows predominantly in [[conifer]]ous forests on [[sand]]y soil, forming [[ectomycorrhizal]] associations in [[symbiosis]] with living trees by enveloping the tree's underground roots with sheaths of fungal tissue. [[Host (biology)|Host]] trees include various species of [[pine]], the [[European silver fir]] and [[European spruce]], as well as [[deciduous tree]]s such as [[chestnut tree]]s, [[oak tree|oak]] and [[beech tree|beech]]. The fungus produces [[spore]]-bearing [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] (i.e. [[mushroom]]s) above ground under pine trees in summer and autumn. It has a red-brown to maroon-coloured cap and a large and bulbous [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], covered with coarse orange-red [[wiktionary:Reticulation|reticulation]]. As with other [[boletes]], the size of the fruiting body is variable.

==Taxonomy==
Italian naturalist [[Carlo Vittadini]] was the first to recognise the pine bolete as a distinct [[taxon]], describing it as ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' var. ''pinicola'' in 1835.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vittadini |first1=Carlo |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/41297153 |title=Descrizione dei funghi mangerecci più comuni dell'Italia e de' velenosi che possono co' medesimi confondersi |date=1835 |publisher=Rusconi |location=[[Milan]] |pages=168–170}}</ref> It was raised to species status (as ''B.&nbsp;pinicola'') by [[Carlo Antonio Venturi|Antonio Venturi]] in 1863. [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] treated it as a variety of ''Boletus aestivalis'' in 1910.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Saccardo |first1=Pier Andrea |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4308231 |title=Sylloge fungorum omnium hucusque cognitorum |last2=Traverso |first2=Giovanni Battista |date=1910 |publisher=Patavii,sumptibus auctoris |volume=9 |page=154}}</ref> It gained its current name in 1973, described by Czech mycologists [[Albert Pilát]] and [[Aurel Dermek]]. A new [[binomial name]] had to be coined as ''B.&nbsp;pinicola'' as [[Author citation (botany)|authored]] by Venturi was [[Validly published name|invalid]] due that name having been previously applied to fungus now known as ''[[Fomitopsis pinicola]]''.<ref name="pilat73" /> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is a mix of [[Latin]] ''pinus'' "pine",<ref name="simpson" /> and [[Ancient Greek]] ''philus'' "loving".<ref name="Liddell 1980" /> ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' is classified in ''Boletus'' [[Section (botany)|section]] ''Boletus''; genetic analysis of European members in this group confirmed it is close to but genetically distinct from ''B.&nbsp;edulis'' and proposed maintaining its status as a separate species.<ref name="peersoonia" />

In 2008, a [[taxonomic revision]] of [[western North America]]n populations of this species was published, formally establishing them as a distinct species, ''[[Boletus rex-veris|B. rex-veris]]''.<ref name="eb1">{{cite journal |last=Arora |first=David |year=2008 |title=California porcini: three new taxa, observations on their harvest, and the tragedy of no commons |url=http://www.davidarora.com/uploads/arora_california_porcini.pdf |journal=[[Economic Botany]] |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=356–375 |doi=10.1007/s12231-008-9050-7 |s2cid=23176365 |access-date=2017-10-07 |archive-date=2012-03-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312213054/http://www.davidarora.com/uploads/arora_california_porcini.pdf }}</ref> Populations from eastern North America under pine have been reclassified as a new species ''[[Boletus pseudopinophilus|B. pseudopinophilus]]''.

==Description==
The fruiting body has a convex-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], at first small in relation to its [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]], expanding in volume as it matures. The skin of the cap is dry, matte and can be coloured from maroon to chocolate brown with a reddish tint.<ref name="Phillips06" /> It is thicker than other [[porcini]]-like boletes and is gelatinous.<ref name="peersoonia" /> These characteristics distinguish it visually from relatives such as ''Boletus edulis'', ''[[Boletus reticulatus|B.&nbsp;reticulatus]]'' and ''[[Boletus aereus|B.&nbsp;aereus]]''. The young, immature cap may have a pale pink colour and a white, powdery flush.

As with all boletes, the size of the [[fruiting body]] can vary greatly. The cap diameter can be as much as {{convert|40|cm|abbr=off}}, the stem height {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} and stem diameter {{convert|16|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}.<ref name="Phillips06" /> Measuring {{convert|4 to 10|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} tall by {{convert|3 to 8|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide, the bulbous stipe is often large, swollen and imposing, bearing a network pattern, much coarser in this species than other porcinis.<ref name="peersoonia" /> The overall colour may have an orange-red tinge which is more obvious in the lowest parts, although this is also common in other species. Like other boletes, ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' has small pores on the underside of its cap rather than gills. These are coloured white at first, becoming yellow with age and olive-brown at full maturity. The [[spore]]s are cylindric-ellipsoid, smooth, with oil drops and dimensions 15.5&ndash;20 by 4.5&ndash;5.5&nbsp;[[μm]]. They produce an olive-brown [[spore print]].<ref name="Phillips06" />

==Distribution and habitat==
''Boletus pinophilus'' is the rarest of the porcini-like mushrooms in Europe, though is found across temperate regions.<ref name="Gallardi20"/>  It is found in Britain,<ref name=Phillips06/> where it is more common in Scotland, and in France, where it is more common in the south,<ref name=Lamaison05>{{cite book |title=The Great Encyclopedia of Mushrooms |last=Lamaison |first=Jean-Louis |author2=Polese, Jean-Marie |year=2005 |publisher=Könemann |isbn=3-8331-1239-5|page=29}}</ref> [[Leningrad Oblast]] and [[Vologda Oblast]] in Russia,<ref name=fedosova14>{{cite journal |last1=Fedosova |first1=Anna G. |last2=Kovalenko |first2=Alexander E. |title=Section ''Boletus'' of the genus ''Boletus'' in Russia: species diversity, morphology, ecology and phylogeny |journal=[[Mikologiya i Fitopatologiya]] |date=2014 | issn=0026-3648 |language=Russian |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=86–106}}</ref> and Ukraine.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Akulov |first1=O.Yu |last2=Pryidiuk |first2=M.P. |title=The preliminary checklist of boletoid fungi of Ukraine |journal=[[Pagine di Micologia]] |date=2007 |volume=27 |issue=117–144 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323320519}}</ref> The bolete is considered [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] in the [[Czech Republic]].<ref name="Mikšik 2012"/> It extends into [[Asia Minor]] and southwestern Asia,<ref name="Gallardi20"/> specifically as far as the [[Perm Krai]] in central Russia,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Perevedentseva |first1=Lydia G. |title=Edible Mushrooms in the Perm Territory Forests (Russia) |journal=[[Poljoprivreda I Sumarstvo]] |date=2011 |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=7–19| issn=0554-5579}}</ref> and [[Irkutsk Oblast]] in Siberia.<ref name=fedosova14/> It is also found in exotic [[pine plantation]]s (such as ''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'') in eastern North America, Mexico, Chile, South Africa and New Zealand.<ref name="Gallardi20"/> Native populations from China and North America have been mostly confirmed as other distinct species.<ref name="Gallardi20"/>

== Ecology ==
''B. pinophilus'' forms [[ectomycorrhizal]] relationships in [[symbiosis]] with [[pine]] (''Pinus'') species such as stone pine (''[[Pinus cembra|P.&nbsp;cembra]]''), black pine (''[[Pinus nigra|P.&nbsp;nigra]]''), Corsican pine (''P.&nbsp;nigra'' subsp. ''laricio''), cluster pine (''[[Pinus pinaster|P.&nbsp;pinaster]]''), Monterey pine (''[[Pinus radiata|P.&nbsp;radiata]]''), Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris|P. sylvestris]]'') and ''[[Pinus uncinata|P. uncinata]]'', as well as European silver fir (''[[Abies alba]]'') and European spruce (''[[Picea abies]]'').<ref name="Gallardi20" /> It can therefore be located wherever those trees grow, particularly with Scots pine in Britain,<ref>{{cite web | title=''Boletus pinophilus'' record at BioImages UK | publisher=[[BioImages]] (UK) | url=http://www.bioimages.org.uk/HTML/T30235.HTM | access-date=28 August 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080902030912/http://www.bioimages.org.uk/HTML/T30235.HTM <!--Added by H3llBot--> | archive-date=September 2, 2008 }}</ref> preferring the poor, [[acidic soil|acidic]], and sandy soils associated with [[conifer]]ous forests. It appears to favour ''Pinus'', while the form of the mushroom occurring in association with ''Abies'' and ''Picea'' has been labeled ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' var. ''fuscoruber''.<ref name="peersoonia" /> However, it is not confined to [[coniferous]] trees and may also be found fruiting in [[deciduous forest]]s, such as under chestnut trees (''[[Castanea sativa]]''),<ref name="Lamaison05" /> oak (''[[Quercus]]''), beech (''[[Fagus sylvatica]]''), and possibly birch (''[[Betula]]'' species), and hornbeam (''[[Carpinus]]'').<ref name="Gallardi20" /> Fruiting bodies can occur singly, or in small groups throughout the summer and autumn months, although they are known to appear as early as April in Italy.<ref name="gruppo" /> A 2007 field study on four species of boletes revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its [[mycelia]] below ground, even when [[soil sample]]s were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies appear to be more complex than previously thought.<ref name="Peintner 2007" />

==Uses==

''Boletus pinophilus'' is edible,<ref name="hinkova" /><ref name="mushbook" /> and may be used fresh, preserved, dried and cooked in a manner similar to that of other edible [[bolete]]s.<ref name="hinkova">{{cite book | author = Ts. Hinkova | year = 1986 | title = Нашите Гъби | page = 41 | publisher = [[Zemizdat (Bulgaria)]] }}</ref><ref name="mushbook" /> It is highly regarded and can be quite expensive in central Mexico, and is often sold dried there.<ref name="Montoya 2004" /> The flesh is white, soft in mature specimens and does not change colour upon bruising. The taste and smell is pleasant.<ref name="hinkova" /> People of [[La Malinche]] have likened the flavour to pork and pork crackling.<ref name="Montoya 2004" /> It is easily misidentified as the porcini ''B.&nbsp;edulis'', due to the similar habitat and appearance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreningen til Svampekundskabens Fremme|publisher=[[Danish Mycological Society]]|access-date=2009-02-06|url=http://www.svampe.dk/svampe/indeks/sum41-50.htm}}</ref> It is a highly regarded food item, especially across the southern European regions of Portugal, the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Navarre]] in Spain, France, Italy, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]].<ref name="dospatliev17">{{cite journal |last1=Dospatliev |first1=Lilko |last2=Ivanova |first2=Miroslava |title=''Boletus pinophilus'' growing in Bulgaria: Chemical Profile and Hazard Index |journal=[[Comptes Rendus de l'Académie Bulgare des Sciences]] |date=2017 |volume=70 |issue=6}}</ref> In the vicinity of [[Borgo Val di Taro|Borgotaro]] in the Province of Parma of northern Italy, the four species ''B.&nbsp;edulis'', ''B.&nbsp;aereus'', ''B.&nbsp;reticulatus'', and ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' have been recognised for their superior taste and officially termed ''Fungo di Borgotaro''.

Fresh mushrooms are up to 90% water, and rich in carbohydrates.<ref name="dospatliev17" /> Unsaturated alcohols are a major component of the aroma of porcini mushrooms; [[1-Octen-3-ol]], [[2-octen-1-ol]], {{nowrap|[[3-Octanone]]}}, [[(E)-2-octenal]], [[oct-1-en-3-one]] and [[1,7,7-trimethyl-heptan-2-one]], [[Acrylic acid|2-propenoic acid]] and [[1,3-octadiene]] are the main volatile compounds in ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus''.<ref name="bozok" /> ''B.&nbsp;pinophilus'' is known to be a [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulator]] of the heavy metals [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[cadmium]] and [[selenium]].<ref name="Falandysz 2002" /><ref name="cocchi" /> To reduce exposure, authorities recommend avoiding mushrooms from polluted areas such as those near mines, smelters, roadways, incinerators and disposal sites. Furthermore, pores should be removed as they contain the highest concentrations of pollutants.<ref name="benjamin" />
