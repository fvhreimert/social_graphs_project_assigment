P. Kumm. - Livid Pinkgill |access-date=2021-05-21 |work= First Nature }}</ref> '''leaden entoloma''', and '''lead poisoner''') is a [[poisonous mushroom]] found across Europe and North America. Some guidebooks refer to it by its older scientific names of ''Entoloma lividum'' or ''Rhodophyllus sinuatus''. The largest mushroom of the [[genus]] of pink-[[spore]]d fungi known as ''[[Entoloma]]'', it is also the [[type species]]. Appearing in late summer and autumn, [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] are found in [[deciduous forest|deciduous woodlands]] on clay or chalky soils, or nearby parklands, sometimes in the form of [[fairy ring]]s. Solid in shape, they resemble members of the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]''. The ivory to light grey-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is up to {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} across with a margin that is rolled inward. The sinuate [[gill (mushroom)|gill]]s are pale and often yellowish, becoming pink as the [[spore]]s develop. The thick whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] has no [[annulus (mycology)|ring]].

When young, it may be mistaken for the [[edible mushroom|edible]] St George's mushroom (''[[Calocybe gambosa]]'') or the miller (''[[Clitopilus prunulus]]''). It has been responsible for many cases of [[mushroom poisoning]] in Europe. ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'' causes primarily [[gastrointestinal problem]]s that, though not generally life-threatening, have been described as highly unpleasant. Delirium and depression are uncommon [[sequela]]e. It is generally not considered to be lethal, although one source has reported deaths from the consumption of this mushroom.<ref>{{cite book|title=Poisonous Mushrooms of the Northern United States and Canada|author=Joseph F.

== Name and relationships ==
''.<ref name=Redeuilh1999/>|alt=an old line drawing of the various parts of a mushroom fruit body]]
The saga of this species' name begins in 1788 with the publication of part 8 of [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard|Jean Baptiste Bulliard]]'s ''Herbier de la France''. In it was plate 382, representing a mushroom which he called ''[[Agaricus]] lividus''.<ref name=Bulliard1788/> In 1872, [[Lucien Quélet]] took up a species which he called "''[[Entoloma]] lividus'' Bull.";<ref name=Quelet1872/><ref name=Redeuilh1995/> although all subsequent agree that this is a fairly clear reference to Bulliard's name, Quélet gave a description that is generally considered to be that of a different species from Bulliard's.<ref name=Redeuilh1999/><ref name=Redeuilh1995/> In the meantime, 1801 had seen the description of ''Agaricus sinuatus'' by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon|Christian Persoon]] in his ''[[Synopsis Methodica Fungorum]]''.<ref name=Persoon1801/> He based that name on another plate (number 579) published in the last part of Bulliard's work, and which the latter had labelled "agaric sinué".<ref group=note>Which means that under the modern principles of nomenclature, Persoon, not Bulliard, is the first to have used the name, since only names in Latin can be considered.</ref> German mycologist [[Paul Kummer]] reclassified it as ''Entoloma sinuatum'' in 1871.<ref name=Kummer1871/>

For many years Quélet's name and description were treated as valid because Bulliard's name antedated Persoon's. However, in 1950, a change in the ''[[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]]'' (termed the Stockholm Code, after the city where the International Botanical Congress was being held) caused only names on fungi published after 1801 or 1821 (depending on their type) to be valid.<ref name=Korf1982/> This meant that suddenly Bulliard's name was no longer a valid name, and now it was Persoon's name that had priority. Nonetheless, it was a well-known name, and the already chaotic situation caused by a change to a famous Latin name was further complicated by another of Quélet's suggestions. He had in 1886 proposed a new, broader genus that included all pink-gilled fungi with [[Lamella (mycology)#Classification|adnate or sinuate gills]] and angular spores: ''Rhodophyllus''.<ref name=Quelet1886/> These two approach to genus placement, using either ''Rhodophyllus'' or ''Entoloma'', coexisted for many decades, with mycologists and guidebooks following either;<ref name=Singer1975/> [[Henri Romagnesi]], who studied the genus for over forty years, favoured ''Rhodophyllus'', as initially did [[Rolf Singer]].<ref name=Singer1975/> However, most other authorities have tended to favor ''Entoloma'',<ref name=Noordeloos1992/> and Singer conceded the name was far more widely used and adopted it for his ''Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'' text in 1986.<ref name=Singer1986/>

In the meantime, it had been widely accepted that the 1950 change to the Stockholm Code caused more problems than they solved, and in 1981, the Sydney Code reinstated the validity of pre-1801 names, but created the status of [[sanctioned name]] for those used in the foundational works of Persoon and [[Elias Magnus Fries]].<ref name=Korf1982/> Thus ''Entoloma sinuatum'', which Fries had sanctioned,<ref name=Fries1821/> still had to be used for the species described by Quélet even though Bulliard's name was the older one. At about the same time, [[Machiel Noordeloos]] re-examined Bulliard's name in more details, and discovered that not only was it [[Illegitimate name|illegitimate]] (and thus not available for use) because [[William Hudson (botanist)|William Hudson]] had already used it ten years earlier for a different species, but Bulliard's illustration was clearly not an ''Entoloma'', but a species of ''[[Pluteus]]'',<ref group=note>It is now generally accepted the species in question is ''[[Pluteus cervinus]]''.</ref> a genus that is only distantly related to ''Entoloma''.<ref name=Redeuilh1995/> As this made Quélet's name definitely unusable for the ''Entoloma'', and because at the time he and Romagnesi<ref name=romagnesi1978/> believed there were ground to treat Quélet's "''E. lividum''" and Persoon's ''E. sinuatum'' as separate species, he had to coin a third name for Quélet's species: ''Entoloma eulividum''.<ref name=Redeuilh1995/><ref name=Noordeloos1985/> He however later changed his mind on this issue, combining again his own ''Entoloma eulividum'' and ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'', so that Persoon's name is now universally recognised.<ref name=Noordeloos1992/><ref name=Breitenbach1991/> Because it was previously widely used and Quélet had provided a good description and illustration (which, the proposer argued, was better considered as a new species rather than a mere placement of Bulliard's name in another genus),<ref name=Redeuilh1995/> a proposal was made in 1999 to [[Conserved name|conserve]] ''Entoloma lividum'' and thus restore its use.<ref name=Redeuilh1999/> However, it failed because ''E. sinuatum'' had already been in use (if not universally) for many years and was thus a well-known name for the species.<ref name=Gams2001/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''sinuatum'' is the [[Latin]] for "wavy", referring to the shape of the cap, while the generic name is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''entos/ἐντός'' "inner" and ''lóma/λῶμα'' "fringe" or "hem" from the inrolled margin.<ref name=Nilson1977/> The specific epithet ''lividum'' was derived from the Latin word ''līvǐdus'' "lead-coloured".<ref name=Simpson1979/> The various [[common name]]s include livid entoloma, livid agaric, livid pinkgill, leaden entoloma, lead poisoner,<ref name=Foster1994/> and grey pinkgill.<ref name=McKnight1987/> In the [[Dijon]] region of France it was known as ''le grand empoisonneur de la [[Côte-d'Or]]'' ("the great poisoner of ''Côte d'Or''").<ref name=Ramsbottom1953/> Quélet himself, who was poisoned by the fungus, called it ''the miller's purge'', akin to another common name of false miller.<ref name=Lamaison05/>

Within the large genus ''Entoloma'', which contains more than 1900 species, ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'' has been classically placed in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Entoloma'' within the [[subgenus]] ''Entoloma'',<ref>Noordeloos, ''Fungi Europaei'', p. 72.</ref> as it is the [[type species]] of the genus.<ref name=Singer1986/> A 2009 study analyzing [[DNA sequence]]s and spore [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] found it to lie in a rhodopolioid [[clade]] with (among other species) ''[[Entoloma sordidulum|E.&nbsp;sordidulum]]'', ''[[Entoloma politum|E.&nbsp;politum]]'' and ''[[Entoloma rhodopolium|E.&nbsp;rhodopolium]]'', and most closely related to ''E.''&nbsp;sp.&nbsp;1.<ref group=note name=sp1/> This rhodopolioid clade lay within a crown ''Entoloma'' clade.<ref name=Codavid2009/><!-- cites para apart from note -->

== Description ==

The largest member of its genus,<ref name=Nilson1977/> ''Entoloma sinuatum'' has an imposing [[epigeous]] (aboveground) [[fruiting body]] (basidiocarp), bearing a [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] 6–20&nbsp;cm ({{frac|2|1|2}}–6&nbsp;in) wide, though diameters of {{convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} have been recorded.<ref name=Haas1969/> It is convex to flat, often with a blunt [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] in its centre and wavy margins, ivory white to light grey-brown in color, and darkening with age. The distant [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are sinuate (notched at their point of attachment to the [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]]) to almost free, generally (but not always) yellowish white before darkening to pink and then red. Interspersed between the gills are lamellulae (short gills that do not extend completely from the cap margin to the stipe).<ref name=Bresinsky1989/> When viewed from beneath, a characteristic groove colloquially known as a "moat" can be seen in the gill pattern circumnavigating the stalk.<ref name=Haas1969/> The [[form (botany)|form]] lacking yellow color on the gills is rare but widespread, and has been recorded from Austria, France and the Netherlands.<ref name=Noor114>Noordeloos, ''Fungi Europaei'', p. 114.</ref>

The stout white stipe lacks a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] and is anywhere from {{convert|4|to|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} high, and {{convert|0.5|–|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter. It may be bulbous at the base. The taste is mild, although it may be unpleasant. The mushroom's strong and unusual odor can be hard to describe; it may smell of flour, though is often unpleasant and [[wikt:rancid|rancid]]. The [[spore print]] is reddish-brown, with angular spores 8–11 × 7–9.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], roughly six-sided and globular in shape. The [[basidia]] are four-spored and clamped. The gill edge is fertile, and [[cystidia]] are absent.<ref name=Noor1113>Noordeloos, ''Fungi Europaei'', pp. 111–13.</ref><!-- cites para -->

Confusion with the highly regarded miller or sweetbread mushroom (''[[Clitopilus prunulus]]'') is a common cause of poisoning in France; the latter fungus has a greyish -white downy cap and whitish decurrent gills which turn pink with maturity.<ref name=Lamaison05/> Young fruit bodies of ''Entoloma sinuatum'' can also be confused with St George's mushroom (''[[Calocybe gambosa]]''),<ref name=Nilson1977/> although the gills of the latter are crowded and cream in color, and the clouded agaric (''[[Clitocybe nebularis]]''), which has whitish decurrent gills and an unusual, starchy, rancid or rancid starch odor.<ref name=Haas1969/> To complicate matters, it often grows near these edible species.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> Its overall size and shape resemble members of the genus ''[[Tricholoma]]'', although the spore color (white in ''Tricholoma'', pinkish in ''Entoloma'') and shape (angular in ''Entoloma'') help distinguish it.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> The rare and edible all-white dovelike tricholoma (''[[Tricholoma columbetta|T.&nbsp;columbetta]]'') has a satiny cap and stem and a faint, not mealy, odor.<ref name=Lamaison05/> ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'' may be confused with ''[[Clitocybe multiceps]]'' in the [[Pacific Northwest]] of North America, although the latter has white spores and generally grows in clumps.<ref name=Ammirati1985/> A casual observer may mistake it for an edible field mushroom (''[[Agaricus campestris]]''),<ref name=Ramsbottom1953/> but this species has a ring on the stipe, pink gills that become chocolate-brown in maturity, and a dark brown spore print.<ref name=Miller2006/> The poorly known North American species ''[[Entoloma albidum|E. albidum]]'' resembles ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'' but is likewise poisonous.<ref name=Ammirati1985/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
''Entoloma sinuatum'' is fairly common and widespread across North America<ref name=Ammirati1985/> as far south as [[Arizona]].<ref name=Bates2006/> It also occurs throughout Europe and including Ireland and Britain,<ref name="urlNorthernIrelandFungusGroup"/> though it is more common in southern and central parts of Europe than the northwest.<ref name=Noor1113/> In Asia, it has been recorded in the Black Sea region,<ref name=Sesli2008/> the [[Adıyaman Province]] in Turkey,<ref name=Kaya2010/> Iran,<ref name=Asef2010/> and northern [[Yunnan]] in China.<ref name=Horak1987/>

The fruit bodies of ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'' grow solitarily or in groups,<ref name=Ammirati1985/> and have been found forming [[fairy ring]]s.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> Fruit bodies appear mainly in autumn, and also in summer in North America,<ref name=Ammirati1985/> while in Europe the season is reported as late summer and autumn.<ref name=Noor1113/> They are found in [[temperate deciduous forest|deciduous woodlands]] under [[oak]], [[beech]], and less commonly [[birch]], often on clay or [[calcareous]] (chalky) soils,<ref name=Noor1113/> but they may spread to in parks, fields and grassy areas nearby.<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> Most members of the genus are [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]],<ref>Noordeloos, ''Fungi Europaei'', p. 38.</ref> although this species has been recorded as forming an [[Mycorrhiza#Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal]] relationship with willow (''[[Salix]]'').<ref name=Agerer2002/>

== Toxicity ==
This fungus has been cited as being responsible for 10% of all [[mushroom poisoning]]s in Europe.<ref name=Alder1961/> For example, 70 people required hospital treatment in [[Geneva]] alone in 1983,<ref name=Chapuis1984/> and the fungus accounted for 33 of 145 cases of mushroom poisoning in a five-year period at a single hospital in [[Parma]].<ref name=Bocci1995/> Poisoning is said to be mainly [[human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal]] in nature; symptoms of [[diarrhoea|diarrhea]], vomiting and headache occur 30&nbsp;minutes to 2&nbsp;hours after consumption and last for up to 48&nbsp;hours. Acute liver toxicity and psychiatric symptoms like mood disturbance or [[delirium]] may occur. Rarely, symptoms of depression may last for months.<ref name=Benjamin1995/> At least one source reports there have been fatalities in adults and children.<ref name=Benedict1972/> Hospital treatment of poisoning by this mushroom is usually [[palliative care|supportive]]; [[antispasmodic]] medicines may lessen [[wikt:colic|colicky]] abdominal cramps and [[Activated carbon#Medical applications|activated charcoal]] may be administered early on to bind residual toxin. [[Intravenous therapy|Intravenous]] fluids may be required if dehydration has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly.<ref>Benjamin, ''Mushrooms: Poisons and Panaceas'', pp. 354–55.</ref> [[Metoclopramide]] may be used in cases of recurrent vomiting once gastric contents are emptied.<ref>Benjamin, ''Mushrooms: Poisons and Panaceas'', p. 188.</ref> The identity of the toxin(s) is unknown, but [[chemical analysis]] has established that there are [[alkaloid]]s present in the mushroom.<ref name=Bastida1987/>

A study of [[trace element]]s in mushrooms in the eastern [[Black Sea Region]] of Turkey found ''E.&nbsp;sinuatum'' to have the highest levels of [[copper]] (64.8 ± 5.9&nbsp;μg/g [[Dry matter|dried material]]—insufficient to be toxic) and [[zinc]] (198&nbsp;μg/g) recorded.<ref name=Tuzen2007/> Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] in southeastern Poland showed it to [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the [[humus]]-rich substrate.<ref name=Falandysz2002/> ''Entoloma sinuatum'' also accumulates [[arsenic]]-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40&nbsp;μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was [[arsenite]] and the other 92% was [[arsenate]].<ref name=Byrne1995/>
