'''''Omphalotus illudens''''', commonly known as the '''eastern jack-o'lantern mushroom''', is a North American species of fungus.

== Description ==
It forms a large, orange [[mushroom]]. The caps grow up to {{Convert|15|cm|frac=4}} wide. The gills are decurrent and the stem is up to 15&nbsp;cm long. The flesh is orange and the [[spore print]] is white to cream.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=476}}</ref>

Its gills often exhibit a weak green [[bioluminescence]] when fresh. This green glow has been mentioned in several journal articles, which state that the phenomenon can persist up to 40–50 hours after the mushroom has been picked.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vanden Hoek |first1=Todd, L. |last2=Erickson |first2=Timothy |last3=Hryborczuk |first3=Daniel |last4=Narasimhan |first4=Kris |title=Jack O'Lantern Mushroom Poisoning |journal=Annals of Emergency Medicine |date=May 1991 |volume=20|issue=5|pages=559–561 |doi=10.1016/S0196-0644(05)81617-8|pmid=2024797 }}</ref>{{vn|date=March 2020}} It is believed that this display serves to attract insects to the mushroom's gills at night, which can then distribute its spores across a wider area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Oliveira |first1=Anderson, G. |last2=Stevani |first2=Cassius, V. |last3=Waldenmeier |first3=Hans, E. |last4=Viviani |first4=Vadim |last5=Emerson |first5=Jillian, M. |last6=Loros |first6=Jennifer, J. |last7=Dunlap |first7=Jay, C. |title=Circadian Control Sheds Light on Fungal Bioluminescence |journal=Current Biology |date=March 2015 |volume=25 |issue=7 |pages=964–8 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2015.02.021|pmid=25802150 |pmc=4382382 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Similar species ===
''Omphalotus'' ''lludens'' is replaced by [[Omphalotus subilludens|''O.&nbsp;subilludens'']] on the [[Gulf Coast]], and [[Omphalotus olivascens|''O.&nbsp;olivascens'']] is found in California.<ref name="audu" /> ''[[Armillaria tabescens]]'' forms small, dull orange caps.<ref name="audu" />

''Omphalotus illudens'' is sometimes confused with edible [[chanterelle]]s, but can be distinguished by its thicker, fleshier appearance, tendency to form large clusters, and clearly separated caps when young. Unlike chanterelles, ''O.&nbsp;illudens'' is poisonous to humans when eaten, whether raw or cooked. Although some older literature claims the name is [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with [[Omphalotus olearius|''O.&nbsp;olearius'']], [[phylogenetic]] analysis confirms the two as distinct species.<ref name="Kirchmair2004" />

== Habitat and distribution ==
''Omphalotus illudens'' is often found in clumps on decaying stumps, buried roots, or at the base of hardwood trees in eastern North America (June–November).<ref name="audu" />

==Toxicity==
The poisonous chemical compounds [[illudin]]&nbsp;S and illudin&nbsp;M were isolated from ''O.&nbsp;illudens''.<ref name="Anchel 1950">{{cite journal|author=Anchel, M.|author2=Herbey, A.|author3=Robbins, W.J. |title=Antibiotic Substances from Basidiomycetes: VII.

[[Muscarine]] has also been indirectly implicated in toxicity,<ref name=Clark1913/> but modern studies to demonstrate its presence in ''O.&nbsp;illudens'' are needed.

The [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] effect of illudin is of interest for treating some cancers, but illudin itself is too poisonous to use directly so it must first be chemically modified. Inside human cells, illudin&nbsp;S reacts with DNA and creates a type of DNA damage that blocks [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. This block can only be relieved by a repair system called [[nucleotide excision repair]]. Damage in non-transcribed DNA areas is left unrepaired by the cell. This property was exploited by the company [[MGI Pharma]] to develop an illudin-derivative called [[Irofulven]] for use as a cancer treatment. Its application is still in the experimental phase.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}<ref>National Center for Biotechnology Information.
