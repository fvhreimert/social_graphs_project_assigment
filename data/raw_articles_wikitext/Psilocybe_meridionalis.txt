'''''Psilocybe meridionalis''''' is a [[psychedelic mushroom]] which has [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]] as main active compounds.   This mushroom is closely related to ''[[Psilocybe stuntzii]]'' but can be distinguished by its smaller spores and the presence of [[pleurocystidia]].  This is the only species of ''Psilocybe'' from [[section Stuntzii]] which has been found in Mexico.    It is known only from the type location in Neverias, Sierra de Cacoma, [[Jalisco, Mexico]].

==Distribution and habitat==
Found in Oak and Pine subtropical forests in the western mountains of Jalisco, Mexico.  The holotype was collected at 2,200 meters elevation.
