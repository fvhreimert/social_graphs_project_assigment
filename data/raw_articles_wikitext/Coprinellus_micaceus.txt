'''''Coprinellus micaceus''''', commonly known as the '''mica cap''', '''glistening inky cap''', or '''shiny cap''', is a common species of [[mushroom]]-forming [[fungus]] in the family [[Psathyrellaceae]].

Formerly known as ''Coprinus micaceus'', the species was transferred to ''[[Coprinellus]]'' in 2001 as [[phylogenetic]] analyses provided the impetus for a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus ''[[Coprinus]]''. Based on external appearance, ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' is virtually indistinguishable from ''[[Coprinellus truncorum|C.&nbsp;truncorum]]'', and it has been suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.

Depending on their stage of development, the [[tawny (color)|tawny]]-brown mushroom [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] may range in shape from oval to bell-shaped to convex, and reach diameters up to {{convert|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}}. The caps, marked with fine radial or linear grooves that extend nearly to the center, rest atop whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stipes]] up to {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|round=0.5}} long. In young specimens, the entire cap surface is coated with a fine layer of reflective [[mica]]-like cells. Although small and with thin [[trama (mycology)|flesh]], the mushrooms are usually bountiful, as they typically grow in dense clusters. A few hours after collection, the [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] will begin to slowly dissolve into a black, inky, [[Basidiospore|spore]]-laden liquid—an [[enzyme|enzymatic]] process called ''autodigestion'' or ''deliquescence''. 

With a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], the [[saprobe]] typically produces clusters on or near rotting [[hardwood]] tree stumps or underground tree roots. The fruit bodies are [[edible mushroom|edible]] before the gills blacken and dissolve; cooking stops the autodigestion process. [[Chemical analysis]] of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of [[antibacterial]] and [[enzyme]]-inhibiting compounds.

== Taxonomy ==
[[image:Agaricus micaceus Bulliard.png|thumb|1786 illustration|alt=Illustration of several light brown mushrooms of various sizes.]]
''Coprinellus micaceus'' was illustrated in a [[woodcut]] by the 16th-century botanist [[Carolus Clusius]] in what is arguably the first published [[monograph]] on fungi, the 1601 ''Rariorum plantarum historia'' (History of rare plants), in an appendix,<ref>''Fungorum in Pannoniis observatorum brevis historia'' (Brief history of fungi observed in Pannonia [Hungary]), genus XVI, p. cclxxxii.</ref><ref name="Buller p.331"/> Clusius erroneously believed the species to be poisonous, and classified it as a genus of ''Fungi perniciales'' (harmful fungi). The species was first described scientifically by French botanist [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard]] in 1786 as ''Agaricus micaceus'' in his work ''Herbier de la France''.<ref name=Bulliard1786/> In 1801, [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] grouped together all of the gilled fungi that auto-digested (''deliquesced'') during spore discharge into the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Coprinus'' of the genus ''Agaricus''.<ref name=Persoon1801/> [[Elias Magnus Fries]] later raised Persoon's section ''Coprinus'' to genus rank in his ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici'', and the species became known as ''Coprinus micaceus''.<ref name=Fries1838/> It was the [[type species]] of subsection ''Exannulati'' in section ''Micacei'' of the genus ''Coprinus'', a grouping of related [[taxa]] with [[partial veil|veils]] made of sphaerocysts (round swollen cells usually formed in clusters) exclusively or with thin-filamentous connective [[hypha]]e intermixed.<ref name=Singer1986/>  [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] studies published in the 1990s<ref name=Hopple1994/><ref name=Park1999/> demonstrated that many of the [[coprinoid fungi|coprinoid]] (''Coprinus''-like) mushrooms were in fact unrelated to each other. This culminated in a 2001 revision of the genus ''[[Coprinus]]'', which was split into four genera; ''C.&nbsp;micaeus'' was transferred to ''[[Coprinellus]]''.<ref name="Red01"/>

Due partly to their ready availability and the ease with which they may be grown in the laboratory, ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in [[cell biology|cytological]] studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist [[Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link]] reported his observations of the structure of the [[hymenium]] (the fertile [[Basidiospore|spore]]-bearing surface) in 1809,<ref name=Link1809/> but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as [[basidia]] were ''thecae'', comparable in form to the [[ascus|asci]] of the [[Ascomycetes]], and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' were copied in subsequent [[mycology|mycological]] publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 [[Joseph-Henri Léveillé]] and [[August Karl Joseph Corda|August Corda]] independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium.<ref name="Buller p.331">Buller, 1924, p. 331.</ref> In 1924, [[A. H. Reginald Buller]] published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his ''Researches on Fungi''.<ref>Buller, 1924, pp. 328–56.</ref>

=== Etymology ===
The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''micaceus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''mica'', for "crumb, grain of salt" and the suffix -''aceus'', "like, similar";<ref name=Stearn1973/> the modern application of "mica" to [[mica|a very different substance]] comes from the influence of ''micare'', "glitter".<ref name=OED/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "shiny cap",<ref name=Ammirati1987/> the "mica cap" or the "glistening inky cap", all in reference to the mealy particles found on the cap that glisten like [[mica]].<ref name="Arora p348">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/348/mode/2up |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, CA |year=1986 |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=348–49}}</ref>

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is initially {{convert|1–2.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter, oval to cylindrical, but expands to become [[wikt:campanulate|campanulate]] (bell-shaped), sometimes with an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] (a central nipple-like protrusion); finally it flattens somewhat, becoming convex. When expanded, the cap diameter reaches {{convert|0.8–5|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} with the margin torn into rays and turned upwards slightly. The color is yellow-brown or tan often with a darker center, then pale yellow or [[buff (color)|buff]] from the margin inwards.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=205–206|oclc=797915861}}</ref> The cap margin is prominently grooved almost all the way to the center; the grooves mark the positions of the longer [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap. When young, the cap surface is covered with white or whitish shiny particles, remnants of the [[universal veil]] that covers immature specimens.<ref name=Evenson/> The particles are loosely attached and easily washed away, so that older specimens are often smooth.<ref>Buller, 1924, p. 335.</ref> ''Coprinellus micaceus'' is [[hygrophanous]], meaning it assumes different colors depending on its state of hydration.<ref name=McKnight1987/>

The gills are crowded together closely, and have an [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]] (narrow) attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]].<ref name=Orr1979/> Initially white, they change color to dark brown then eventually black as the spores mature. Expansion of the cap causes the gills to split open down their median planes, tearing the cap margin into rays.  The process of spore discharge and autodigestion begin at the bottom of the gills before the upper parts of the gills have become completely blackened.<ref name=Bullerp337/> The brittle stipe is hollow, and measures {{convert|3–10|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long by {{convert|2–5|mm|1|abbr=on|frac=16}} thick and is roughly the same diameter throughout the length of the stipe. It is generally white but may discolor to pale dirty cream from the base up.<ref name=":0" /> The stipe surface is at first velvety with a very fine whitish powder, but this eventually wears off, leaving it more or less smooth. Stipes may have a rudimentary ring at the base, another universal veil remnant.<ref name="Arora p348"/> The [[spore print]] is dark brown or black.<ref name=Orton1979/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin, fragile, white in the stipe, and brownish in the cap.<ref name=Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991/> Its odor and taste are not distinctive.<ref name=Roody2003/> Individual fruit bodies take an average of five to seven days to fully mature.<ref name=Pady1941/>

=== Microscopic characteristics ===


The spores of ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' are reddish-brown or black,<ref name=":0" /> with dimensions of 7–10 by 4.5–6&nbsp;[[μm]]. Generally, they are [[wikt:lentiform|lentiform]] (shaped like a biconvex lens), but viewed from the side they appear more almond-shaped or spindle-shaped, while in front view they appear oval or mitriform (roughly the shape of a miter—a peaked cap). Spores have a [[germ pore]], a flattened area in the center of the spore surface through which a [[germ tube]] may emerge.<ref name=Orton1979/> The spore-bearing cells (the [[basidia]]) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 10–15 by 4–7&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Keirle2004/> Studies have shown that the basidia develop in four discrete generations. The first generation basidia are the most protuberant and extend out the greatest distance from the surface of the hymenium. Subsequent generations of basidia have shorter and less protuberant bodies. When a living gill is viewed with a microscope, the four sets of basidia can be seen distinctly. [[Arthur Henry Reginald Buller|Arthur Buller]] coined the term ''[[wikt:inaequihymeniiferous|inaequihymeniiferous]]'' to describe this mode of hymenial development. The purpose of the staggered basidia sizes is to facilitate the release of spores from the hymenium. There are four zones of spore discharge that correspond to the four sets of basidia, and basidia that have released all of their spores quickly begin to autodigest. The staggered setup minimizes the chance of spores colliding with neighboring basidia during release.<ref>Buller, 1924, pp. 351–53.</ref>

[[Cystidia]] that are located along the edge of the cap (called cheilocystidia) are spherical, and 30–120 by 20–74&nbsp;μm. The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are club-shaped or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155&nbsp;μm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude from the face of the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development.<ref>Buller, 1924, pp. 329, 342.</ref> ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stipe) that are 60–100 by 5–10&nbsp;μm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification.<ref name=Keirle2004/> Both [[Heinrich Anton de Bary|De Bary]] and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of [[cytoplasm]] formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes,<ref name=DeBary1873/> but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the [[vacuole]]s enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.<ref>Buller, 1924, pp. 248–50.</ref>

The [[wikt:globular|globular]] cells that make up the mica-resembling scales on the cap are colorless, smooth-walled, and range in size from about 25–65&nbsp;μm, although most are between 40 and 50&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Bullerp337>Buller, 1924, p. 337.</ref> Buller explained the "glitter" of these cells as follows: "The sparkling of the meal-cells, as well as of the cystidia on the edges and faces of the gills, is simply due to light which strikes them from without and is refracted and reflected to the eye in the same manner as from the minute drops of water one so often sees at the tips of grass leaves on English lawns early in the morning after a dewy night."<ref>Buller, 1924, p. 340.</ref>

In 1914, Michael Levine was the first to report successfully cultivating ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' from spores in the laboratory. In his experiments, fruit bodies appeared roughly 40 to 60 days after initially inoculating the [[growth media]] ([[agar]] supplemented with soil, horse dung, or [[cornmeal]]) with spores.<ref name=Levine1914/> Like other coprinoid species, ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' undergoes synchronous [[meiosis]]. The [[chromosome]]s are readily discernible with light microscopy, and all of the meiotic stages are well-defined. These features have made the species a useful tool in laboratory investigations of basidiomycete [[cytogenetics]].<ref name=Bos1996/><ref name=Moore1996/>  The [[chromosome number]] of ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' is n=12.<ref name=Lu1970/>

The microscopic characteristics and cytogenetics of ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' are well known, and it has been used frequently as a [[model organism]] to study [[cell division]] and [[meiosis]] in [[basidiomycetes]].

The edible ''[[Coprinellus bisporus]]'' is nearly identical but lacks the yellowish cap granules and only has two spores per basidium. The scaly inky cap (''Coprinus variegatus'' = ''[[Coprinus quadrifidus]]'') has a grayish-brown cap with dull white to brownish scales; its odor is disagreeable. The trooping crumble cap (''[[Coprinellus disseminatus]]'', edible) has smaller, yellow-brown to grey-brown caps and white gills that turn black but do not dissolve away; it always grows in large clusters on rotting wood (sometimes buried wood).<ref name=Bessette1987/> ''[[Coprinopsis atramentaria]]'' is a larger,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=196}}</ref> gray species that grows in dense clusters on stumps or on the ground from buried wood, lacks glistening particles on the cap, and the cap and gills dissolve at maturity. ''[[Coprinellus radians]]'' develops singly or in clumps on wood, from a tufted mat of coarse yellow-orange [[mycelium]].<ref name="Healy2008" /> ''[[Coprinellus truncorum]]'' is also covered with glistening granules and is said to be almost indistinguishable from ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' in the field; microscopy is needed to tell the difference, as ''C.&nbsp;truncorum'' has ellipsoid spores with a rounded germ pore, compared to the shield-shaped (mitriform) spores with truncated germ pores of ''C.&nbsp;micaceus''.<ref name=Hemmes2002/> One study suggests that compared to ''C.&nbsp;truncorum'', ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' is browner in the center of the cap (rather than grayish) and has a greater tendency to grow in clusters; more [[molecular genetics|molecular]] evidence is required to determine if the two taxa are genetically identical.<ref name=Keirle2004/> [[Coprinellus flocculosus|''C.&nbsp;flocculosus'']] is another similar species.<ref name=":0" />

== Ecology, habitat and distribution ==
''Coprinellus micaceus'' is a [[saprotrophic]] species, deriving nutrients from dead and decomposing [[organic matter]], and grows in and around stumps or logs of broad-leaved trees or attached to buried wood. It prefers feeding on [[Bark (botany)|bark]], particularly the [[secondary phloem]], rather than the wood.<ref>Buller, 1924, p. 333.</ref> In the scheme of the [[ecological succession|succession]] of fungal species involved in the decomposition of wood, ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' is a ''late stage colonizer'', and prefers to feed on wood that has already decomposed sufficiently to have reached "a friable softened consistency".<ref name=Peiris2008/> A 2010 study suggests that the fungus can also live as an [[endophyte]], inhabiting the woody tissue of healthy trees without causing disease symptoms.<ref name=deErrasti2010/> The fungus is also associated with disturbed or developed ground, such as the sides of roads and paths, gardens, building sites and the edges of parking lots;<ref name="Arora p348"/> it has also been noted for growing indoors on rotting wood in humid environments.<ref name="Arora p348"/> In one instance it was discovered about 120&nbsp;m (400&nbsp;ft) underground in an abandoned coal mine, growing on wooden gangways and props used to support the roof.<ref name=BotGaz1898/>

[[image:Coprinellus micaceus 41717.jpg|thumb|left|A cluster of fruit bodies at the base of a tree in [[Wayne National Forest]], [[Ohio]], US|alt=A cluster of about two dozen tawny-brown mushrooms growing from the base of a tree.]]

Fruit bodies are commonly found growing in dense clusters, but can also be found growing singly or in small clumps, especially in forested areas.<ref name=McKnight1987/> In North America, ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' is one of the first edible mushrooms to appear in the spring,<ref name=Roody2003/> and fruits from April to September. In Europe, it fruits from May to December.<ref name=Dickinson1982/> Although it can grow at any time of the year, it is more prevalent during the spring and fall, coinciding with the higher humidity resulting from spring and autumn rains.<ref name= Healy2008/> A study of air quality conducted in the city of [[Santiago de Compostela]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], concluded that most "''Coprinus''" spores present in the atmosphere belonged to ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'', and that the number of spores went up with increased [[relative humidity|humidity]] and rainfall, but decreased with greater temperatures.<ref name=Aira2009/> The species is known for reappearing with successive fruitings at the same location. In one case, a total of {{convert|38|lb|kg|1|abbr=on}} of fresh mushrooms were collected from one [[elm]] stump in 10 successive crops over a spring and summer.<ref name=Christensen1981/><ref name=Stewart1926/>

''Coprinellus micaceus'' has a [[cosmopolitan distribution]],<ref name=Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991/> and has been collected in northern Africa,<ref name=Melchers1931/> South Africa,<ref name=Reid1999/> Europe (including [[Turkey]]<ref name=Gezer2008/>), North America (as far north as [[Alaska]]),<ref name=Watling1971/> the Hawaiian islands,<ref name=Keirle2004/><ref name=Hemmes2002/> South America,<ref name=Keirle2004/> India,<ref name=Kaul1974/><ref name=Manjula2005/> Australia,<ref name=Dickinson1982/> New Zealand,<ref name=Crowe1983/> and Japan.<ref name="url Ulje"/> [[Phylogenetic]] analysis of [[ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct [[clade]] with little [[genetic diversity]] compared to Asian populations; this suggests that the Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently and have not had much time to develop genetic variation.<ref name=Ko2001/> One study suggests that in South Africa, where ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing ''[[Coprinellus truncorum|C.&nbsp;truncorum]]'', a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been raised about North American species.<ref name=Watling1971/><ref name="urlMushroomExpert"/>

== Edibility ==
''Coprinellus micaceus'' is an edible species,<ref name="Orr1979" /><ref name="Russell2006" /> and cooking inactivates the [[enzyme]]s that cause autodigestion or ''deliquescence''—a process that can begin as soon as one hour after collection.<ref name="Smith1975" /> It is considered good for omelettes,<ref name="Schalkwijk-Barendsen1991" /> and as a flavor for sauces,<ref name="Ammirati1987" /> although it is "a very delicate species easily spoiled by overcooking".<ref name="Dickinson1982" /> The flavor is so delicate that it is easy to overpower and hide with almost anything. The fungus also appeals to fruit flies of the genus ''[[Drosophila]]'', who frequently use the fruit bodies as hosts for [[larva]]e production.<ref name="Kimura1980" /><ref name="Toda1999" />

A study of the [[dietary mineral|mineral]] contents of various edible mushrooms found that ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'' contained the highest concentration of [[potassium]] in the 34 species tested, close to half a gram of potassium per kilogram of mushroom.<ref name="Dursun2006" /> Because the species can [[bioaccumulate]] detrimental [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]] like [[lead]] and [[cadmium]], it has been advised to restrict consumption of specimens collected from roadsides or other collection sites that may be exposed to or contain pollutants.<ref name="Das2007" />

== Bioactive compounds ==
Research into the [[natural product]] chemistry of ''Coprinellus micaceus'' has revealed the presence of several chemical compounds unique to the species. [[Micaceol]] is a [[sterol]] with "modest" [[antibacterial]] activity against the pathogens ''[[Corynebacterium]] [[Corynebacterium xerosis|xerosis]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. The compound (Z,Z)-4-oxo-2,5-heptadienedioic acid has inhibitory activity against [[glutathione S-transferase]], an [[enzyme]] that has been implicated in the resistance of cancer cells against [[Chemotherapy|chemotherapeutic]] agents, especially [[Alkylation|alkylating]] drugs.<ref name=Zahid2006/><ref name=Ata2009/> A 2003 study did not find any antibacterial activity in this species.<ref name=Efremenkova2003/> A 1962 publication reported the presence of the biologically active [[indole]] compound [[tryptamine]] in ''C.&nbsp;micaceus'', although the concentration was not determined.<ref name=Worthen1962/> The fruit bodies additionally produce a variety of [[pigment]] compounds known as [[melanin]]s—complex chemical [[polymer]]s that contribute to the formation of soil [[humus]] after the fruit bodies have disintegrated.<ref name=SaizJimenez1982/> ''C.&nbsp;micaceus''  has been found to be devoid of the toxin [[coprine]], the [[Antabuse|disulfiram]]-mimicking chemical found in ''C.&nbsp;atramentaria'' that causes illness when consumed simultaneously with alcohol.<ref name=Brossi1991/>
