'''''Phallus ravenelii''''', commonly known as '''Ravenel's stinkhorn''',<ref name=NGSWG>{{NGSWG}}</ref> is a [[fungus]] in the [[Phallaceae]] (stinkhorn) family. It is found in eastern [[North America]]. Its [[mushroom]]s commonly grow in large clusters and are noted for their foul odor and [[phallus|phallic]] shape when mature. It is [[saprobic]], and as such it is encountered in a wide variety of habitats rich in wood debris, from forests to mulched gardens or sawdust piles in urban areas. It appears from August to October{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}. The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] emerges from a pink or lavender-colored egg to form a tall, cylindrical, hollow and spongy white stalk with a bell-shaped cap{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}. The remains of the egg persist as a white to pink or lilac [[volva (mycology)|volva]] at the base of the stalk. The cap is covered in a foul-smelling olive-green [[gleba|spore slime]], which attracts insects that help to spread the [[spore]]s{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}. Sometimes, the cap has a "veil" attached—a thin membrane that hangs underneath. The lack of a roughly ridged and pitted cap differentiates it from the closely related ''[[Phallus impudicus]]''. The fungus is named after [[Henry William Ravenel]], a botanist who first discovered it in 1846, though it remained undescribed until 1873{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}. It is considered to be an [[edible mushroom]] while in its egg form{{citation needed|date=November 2023}}.

The species was first [[species description|described]] officially in the scientific literature by English mycologist [[Miles Berkeley]] in an 1873 publication.<ref name=Berkeley1873/> Berkeley obtained the specimens from [[Moses Ashley Curtis]], which had in turn been sent to him by Ravenel from collections he made at the [[Santee River]] in [[South Carolina]] in 1846.<ref name=Peck1882/> Although the specimen had been sent with Ravenel's extensive collection notes, Berkeley's description was brief, and he neglected to mention the veil. American [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]] later disparaged the quality of Berkeley's description, and noted "he was so busy that he could not take the time to consider the details, and his "description" tells nothing of the leading characters of the species."<ref name=Lloyd1907b/> [[Charles Horton Peck]], upon encountering the fungus in North America, could not identify it using Berkeley's description, and instead had to contact Ravenel to obtain his original collection notes before he could confirm its identity. Peck later wrote a full description of the species.<ref name=Peck1882/> In 1898,<ref name=Kuntze1898/> [[Edward Angus Burt]] placed the taxon in the genus ''Dictyophora'', based on the presence of the veil.<ref name=Burt1896/> [[Otto Kuntze]] transferred the taxon to the genus ''Aedycia'' (now equivalent with ''[[Mutinus]]''),<ref name=Kirk2008/> resulting in the [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] ''Aedycia ravenelii''.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Phallus ravenelii"/> The mushroom is commonly known as the eastern stinkhorn<ref name=McKnight1987/> or Ravenel's stinkhorn.<ref name=Bessette1997/>

The mushroom begins its development in the form of pink-, lilac-, or purple-tinged "eggs" that resemble a [[puffball]]. The egg expands rapidly to form a phallus-shaped structure with a yellowish-white [[stipe (mycology)|stalk]] and thimble-like [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]. The cap ranges from {{convert|1.5|to|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in width and {{convert|3|to|4.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} in height;<ref name=Bessette1997/> the entire fruit body can reach heights of {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name="urlkuo"/> The cap texture is finely granular and it is attached to a white open circlet at the top where it meets the stalk.<ref name="urlkuo"/><ref name=Lincoff1981/> In some specimens, this opening is relatively large with a broad margin, and gives the mushroom a truncated appearance. Microscopically, the cap surfaces comprises minute cells and cavities, with a spongy structure similar to that of the stem, but with smaller perforations than the stem.<ref name=Peck1882/> The lower margin of the cap is free from attachment to the stalk, and there is sometimes a membranous veil suspended like a collar around the stem under the cap; the veil can be of varying lengths.<ref name=Lloyd1907/> This veil can be seen in dissected eggs where it is present as a distinct, thin membranous tissue between the stalk and the cap before expansion. In this form, the veil is continuous from its attachment with the "primordial tissue"{{#tag:ref|Primordial tissue is homogenous, compact tissue present in the young (egg-form) fruit body made of densely interwoven [[hypha]]e rich in [[protoplasm]], that later grows and differentiates to form parts of the mature fruit body<ref name=Atkinson1911/>|group=nb}} at the base of the stalk and volva below to the tip of the stem at the point where it joins the cap. The veil produced in ''P.&nbsp;ravenelli'' is distinct from the flaring, net-like ''indusium'' produced by ''Phallus'' species like ''[[Phallus indusiatus|P.&nbsp;indusiatus]]''.<ref name=Atkinson1911/>  [[Gleba]] covers the head and is olive-green to dark brown in color, slimy in texture, and foul smelling. The spores measure 3 to 4.5&nbsp;[[μm]] by 1 to 2&nbsp;μm, are colorless, elliptical in shape, and smooth in texture.<ref name="urlkuo"/><ref name=Lincoff1981/> They are thin-walled and covered with a thin, [[hyaline]] (transparent), sticky coating.<ref name=Miller2006/>

The stalk is hollow and measures {{convert|10|to|15|cm|1|abbr=on}} tall and {{convert|1.5|to|3|cm|1|abbr=on}} thick. It can range in color from slightly yellowish to white. At the stalk's base there is usually a white to pink [[volva (mycology)|volva]] (a sac-like cup). When immature, the fruit body is encapsulated within the volva present as a [[peridium]] (skin-like tissue layer), which ruptures as the mushroom emerges. The volva attaches to the [[substrate (biology)|substrate]] with whitish or pinkish [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]]s (thick, cord-like strands of [[mycelium|mycelia]]).<ref name="urlkuo"/><ref name=Lincoff1981/> Rhizomorphs and mycelia that are exposed to air eventually turn whitish in color; those freshly exposed from their substrate usually quickly turn bluish purple.<ref name=Banker1904/> The fungus produces watery and fleshy [[sclerotium|sclerotia]] that range in thickness from 1 to 10&nbsp;mm with a length of up to 30&nbsp;mm. The sclerotia are irregularly convoluted and lobed, and become hard and horny upon drying.<ref name=Overholts1925/> Sclerotia have a color reaction similar to that noted for rhizomorphs, and, after long exposure to air, will gradually turn a uniform dark reddish brown.<ref name=Banker1904/> ''Phallus ravenelli'' is considered [[edible mushroom|edible]] if in the egg form, and has a "mild" taste.<ref name=Miller2006/> The foul odor of mature mushrooms would dissuade most from collecting for the table.<ref name=Metzler1992/>

''Phallus ravenelli'' is often confused with ''[[Phallus impudicus|P.&nbsp;impudicus]]'' and ''[[Phallus hadriani|P.&nbsp;hadriani]]''.<ref name=Kuo2010/> ''P.&nbsp;impudicus'' has a highly reticulate (a net-like pattern of grooves and ridges) cap under the gleba. ''P.&nbsp;hadriani'' also has a pitted cap, and occurs less frequently than ''P.&nbsp;ravenelii''. The widespread species ''[[Itajahya galericulata]]'' has a roughly spherical cap of several overlapping spongy tissue layers with gleba sandwiched in-between.<ref name=Dennis1953/> ''[[Phallus rugulosus]]'' is tall, thin, pale orange, and tapers towards the smooth cap. The cap is blackish olive in color, while the volva is oval and white. It is found in the eastern and southern United States and China.<ref name=Miller2006/> ''[[Phallus granulosodenticulatus|P.&nbsp;granulosodenticulatus]]'' is a rare Brazilian species with a superficial resemblance to ''P.&nbsp;ravenelii''. Apart from its distribution, it is distinguished from ''P.&nbsp;ravenelii'' by its smaller fruit bodies up to {{convert|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, a [[wikt:cogged|cogged]] cap margin, and somewhat larger spores that measure 3.8–5 by 2–3&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Cortez2011/>

==Distribution and habitat==
Ravenel's stinkhorn is widespread in eastern North America, from [[Quebec]] in the north, south to [[Florida]] and west to [[Iowa]] and [[Ohio]]. West of the [[Mississippi]], the common stinkhorn (''[[Phallus impudicus]]'') becomes more dominant.<ref name=Lincoff1981/> In the early 1900s, Lloyd called it the most common phalloid in the United States.<ref name=Lloyd1909/> The fungus is also found in [[Costa Rica]].<ref name=Saenz1973/>

As a [[saprobic]] mushroom, or decomposer of organic material, Ravenel's stinkhorn can be found in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods.<ref name="urlkuo"/><ref name=Lincoff1981/> The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.<ref name=Miller2006/>
