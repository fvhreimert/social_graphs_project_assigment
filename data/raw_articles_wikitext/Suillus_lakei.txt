'''''Suillus lakei''''', commonly known as the '''matte Jack''', '''Lake's bolete''', or the '''western painted Suillus''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Suillaceae]]. It is characterized by the distinctive reddish-brown tufted fibers or small scales on the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], and the presence of a woolly [[partial veil|veil]] on the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. The caps can reach diameters of up to {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}, while the stems are between {{convert|6 and 12|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long and usually {{convert|1–3|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick. On the underside of the cap is a layer of spongy yellow to yellow-brown angular pores; these pores are covered with a whitish [[partial veil]] when young.

A [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, ''S.&nbsp;lakei'' grows in association with [[Douglas-fir]]. It is native to northwestern North America, but has been [[introduced species|introduced]] to Europe as well as South America and New Zealand. The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but opinions vary as to its quality.

==Taxonomy==
American mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] originally named the species ''Boletinus lakei'' after mycologist E.R.&nbsp;Lake of Oregon Agricultural college (now [[Oregon State University]]). Lake collected the type specimen from [[Corvallis, Oregon]], in late November, 1907.<ref name=Murrill1912/> [[Rolf Singer]] later transferred the species to the genera ''Ixocomus'' and ''Boletinus'' in 1940 and 1945, respectively.<ref name=Singer1940/><ref name=Singer1945/> In their 1964 [[monograph]] on North American ''Suillus'' species, [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[Harry Delbert Thiers]] transferred the species to ''Suillus''. Simultaneously, they described the ''S.&nbsp;lakei'' variety ''pseudopictus'' that they said had been misidentified by collectors as ''Suillus pictus'' (now called ''[[Suillus spraguei]]'') because of its reddish and scaly cap.<ref name=Smith1964/> Singer considered ''[[Suillus amabilis]]'' to be the same species as ''S.&nbsp;lakei'', but Smith and Thiers later examined the [[type (biology)|type]] material of both, and concluded that they were distinct species.<ref name=Smith1967/> Engel and colleagues described a variety in 1996, ''S.&nbsp;lakei'' var. ''landkammeri'',<ref name=Engel1996/> based on ''Boletinus tridentinus'' subsp. ''landkammeri'' described by Czech mycologists [[Albert Pilát]] and [[Mirko Svrček]] in 1949.<ref name=Pilat1949/> The [[Nomenclature|nomenclatural]] databases [[Index Fungorum]] and [[MycoBank]] consider this [[synonym (biology)|synonymous]] with ''S.&nbsp;lakei''.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Suillus lakei var. landkammeri"/><ref name="urlFungorum: Suillus lakei var. landkammeri"/> The mushroom is [[common name|commonly]] known as the "western painted Suillus",<ref name=Arora1986/> the "matte Jack",<ref name=Arora1991/> or "Lake's slippery cap".<ref name=McKnight1987/>

==Description==


The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of ''S.&nbsp;lakei'' is up to {{convert|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter and initially convex, but flattens out somewhat in maturity.<ref name=Arora1986/> The cap is fleshy, dry, yellowish to reddish-brown but fades with age. It is covered with pressed-down hairs or minute tufted scales in the center, with the yellowish flesh visible between the scales. Heavy rain can wash the fibrils off the cap surface, leaving a sticky, glutinous layer behind. Older specimens may be nearly smooth in age. Remnants of the [[partial veil]] sometimes hang from the edge of the cap.<ref name=Arora1986/> The cap margin is initially curved or rolled inwards, but unrolls as it grows and in maturity may be curled upward.<ref name=McKnight1987/>



The tubes that comprise the pore surface on the underside of the cap are {{convert|5–12|mm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} deep; the angular pores are up to 2.5&nbsp;mm wide and radially arranged.<ref name=Bessette2000/> The pores range in color from yellow to brownish-yellow to [[ochre]], and stain brownish or reddish-brown when bruised. They are covered by a [[partial veil]] in young specimens.<ref name=Arora1986/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick, yellow, and either unchanged in color when bruised or broken, or turns pinkish-red. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|6 to 12|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} long and usually {{convert|1–3|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick, yellow, sometimes with reddish streaks (particularly below the [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] zone),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|page=223}}</ref> and solid and yellow within. The species usually lacks the glandular dots on the stem that are characteristic of some ''Suillus'' species. The stem is either equal in width throughout its length, or tapered downwards. The tissue of the stem base may weakly stain bluish-green when cut, although this reaction is not usually apparent in mature specimens.<ref name=Bessette2000/> The ring is delicate and [[wikt:floccose|floccose]] (resembling woolly tufts), and soon disappears or leaves a thin whitish ring on the stem. The [[spore print]] is cinnamon to brown in color.<ref name="urlMushroomExpert"/> The variety ''calabrus'', found in Italy, has a light yellow cap and purple-red scales.<ref name=Lavorato2000/> Variety ''pseudopictus'' has a cap that is redder and more scaly than the more common form.<ref name=Bessette2000/>

The [[basidiospore|spores]] are spindle-shaped to elliptical, have a smooth surface, and dimensions of 8–11 to 3–4&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name=Arora1986/> There are both two- and four-spored [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells), and they are club-shaped, [[hyaline]] (translucent), with dimensions of 28–36 by 10–12&nbsp;μm. [[Cystidia]] are plentiful, and are found in bundles lined along the tube mouths (as cheilocystidia), or more commonly, singly along the sides of the tubes (as pleurocystidia). These structures are thin-walled, cylindrical, and measure 48–60 by 7–9&nbsp;μm. The scales on the cap surface comprise more or less erect hyphae with tips that are clustered together. [[Clamp connection]]s are rare in the hyphae.<ref name=Smith1964/>

Mushrooms with an appearance similar to ''S.&nbsp;lakei'' can often be distinguished by their associations with trees. For example, the eastern North American species ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' grows in association with [[Eastern White Pine]]. The cap of ''S.&nbsp;spraguei'' has red fibrils on a yellow background. ''[[Suillus cavipes|S.&nbsp;cavipes]]'' and ''[[Suillus ochraceoroseus|S.&nbsp;ochraceoroseus]]'' always grow with [[Larch]].<ref name=Miller2006/> ''[[Suillus ponderosus|S.&nbsp;ponderosus]]'', which grows in mixed coniferous forests, has a gelatinous veil.<ref name=McKnight1987/> Smith and Thiers note that it is difficult to tell the difference between the two if ''S.&nbsp;ponderosus'' has lost its veil, since the colors of the species intergrade and cannot reliably be used to distinguish them.<ref name=Smith1964/> ''[[Suillus decipiens|S.&nbsp;decipiens]]'' has a cap that is orangish to pink-orange with hairs or scales. ''[[Suillus caerulescens|S.&nbsp;caerulescens]]'' is a similar species in western North America; it can be distinguished by the strong blue staining that develops when the stem is injured.<ref name=Miller2006/>

==Habitat and distribution==

''Suillus lakei'' is [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and western parts of North America. Its range extends south into Mexico.<ref name=Barranco2010/> Fruit bodies grow solitarily or in groups on the ground in young conifer stands or grassy parkland. Fruiting occurs in the late summer and autumn, later on the West Coast.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |page=302}}</ref> ''Suillus lakei'' forms [[ectomycorrhiza]]e with [[Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii''), and its distribution coincides with this tree. It is one of the most common bolete species found in northwestern [[Montana]] and [[Idaho]].<ref name=Miller2006/> In a study of [[host (biology)|host]] specificity in [[pure culture]] in the laboratory, ''S.&nbsp;lakei'' failed to form healthy ectomycorrhizas with ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' roots; the hyphae were covered in [[mucilage]]-like deposits and appeared to be collapsed.<ref name=Malajczuk1984/>  It has also been noted to prefer poor, exposed soil such as that found on road banks and campgrounds.<ref name=Arora1986/> It can often be found with the mushroom ''[[Gomphidius subroseus]]'', another species that associates with Douglas-fir.<ref name=Evenson1997/>

Both Douglas-fir and ''S.&nbsp;lakei'' are non-native [[introduced species]] in Europe. The fungus has been found in several central and south European countries following the intentional introduction of Douglas-fir.<ref name=Boletales/> These include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic,<ref name=Zahradka2005/> Germany, Hungary,<ref name=Vasas1990/> Italy,<ref name=Lavorato1999/> and Slovakia.<ref name=FirstrecordsBG2006/> It is considered [[endangered]] in the Czech Republic.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Holec |first1=J. |last2=Beran |first2=M. |date=2006 |title=Červený seznam hub (makromycetů) České republiky |trans-title=Red list of fungi (macromycetes) of the Czech Republic |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/291995230 |journal=Agency for Nature Conservation and Landscape Protection of the Czech Republic (AOPK ČR) |language=Czech |volume=24 |pages=1–282}}</ref><ref name="Mikšik 2012"/> ''Suillus lakei'' has also been reported in South America (Argentina<ref name="Barroetavena2007" /> and Chile)<ref name="Valenzuela1999" /> and in the [[South Island]] of New Zealand.<ref name="Myra1986" />

==Edibility==
''Suillus lakei'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]],<ref name="urlCalifornia"/> although opinions vary considerably as to its quality. It has been called choice,<ref name=Weber1980/> mediocre,<ref name=Kuo2007/> and of poor taste and texture.<ref name=Evenson1997/> Laboratory tests indicate that the fruit bodies have [[antimicrobial]] activity, and contain [[alkaloid]]s and [[tannin]]s.<ref name=Barranco2010/>
