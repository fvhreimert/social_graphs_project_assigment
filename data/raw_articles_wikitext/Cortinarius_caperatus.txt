'''''Cortinarius caperatus''''' is a species of fungi of the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]''. It was known as ''Rozites caperata'' for many years before genetic studies revealed that it belonged to the genus ''Cortinarius''. The Latin [[Specific name (botany)|specific name]], ''caperatus'', means wrinkled, and refers to the distinctive texture of the cap. The ochre-coloured [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is up to 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) across and has a fibrous surface. The clay-colored [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are attached to the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] under the cap, and the stipe is whitish with a whitish [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]]. The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] has a mild smell and flavor. It can resemble a number of other species, including the poisonous ''[[Inosperma erubescens]]'' in central Europe in summer.

Fruiting bodies of ''C.&nbsp;caperatus'' appear in northern parts of Europe and North America in addition to temperate Asia. They can be found in [[conifer]]ous and [[beech]] woods in autumn as well as [[heath]]lands in late summer and autumn. The mushrooms have been found to [[bioaccumulate]] [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and radioactive isotopes of [[caesium]] and can also be infested by [[maggot]]s. It is otherwise a highly regarded [[Edible mushroom|edible species]] amongst European [[mushroom foragers]].

== Taxonomy ==
The mushroom was originally [[species description|described]] as ''Agaricus caperatus'' in 1796 by South African mycologist [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]], who noted it grew in beech woods.<ref name=persoon1796/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''caperatus'' is Latin for "wrinkled".<ref name="Nilper" /> Bohemian naturalist [[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz]] illustrated it in his ''Naturgetreue Abbildungen und Beschreibungen der essbaren, schädlichen und verdächtigen Schwämme'', published between 1831 and 1846.<ref name=krombholz/> It was transferred to the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'' by the Swedish mycologist [[Elias Magnus Fries]] in 1838.<ref name="Fries 1838"/> Later it was transferred to ''[[Pholiota]]'' in 1874 by French mycologist [[Claude Casimir Gillet]],<ref name=gillet1874/> a placement followed by Italian naturalist [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]].<ref name="Sylloge"/> Finnish mycologist [[Petter Adolf Karsten]] established the genus ''Rozites'' in 1879 to accommodate the species—as ''Rozites caperatus''—on the basis of the mushroom having a double veil;<ref name=karsten/> that is, a [[partial veil]]—the remnants of which become a [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]] on the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]]—as well as a [[universal veil]].<ref name=peintner2002a/> It was known as a ''Rozites'' species for many years.<ref name=peintner2002a/> Meanwhile, French mycologist [[Lucien Quélet]] classified ''Pholiota'' as a [[subgenus]] of ''Dryophila'' in 1886, resulting in ''Dryophila caperata'' being added to the species' synonymy.<ref name="Quélet 1886"/> [[Worthington George Smith]] placed it in his new genus ''Togaria'' (now considered a synonym of ''[[Agrocybe]]'').<ref name=wgsmith/>

Genetic analysis in 2000 and 2002 showed that ''Rozites'' was not a discrete group and its members were nested within ''Cortinarius''.<ref name=peintner2002a/><ref name="Høiland2000"/> This fungus was found to be closely related to the New Zealand species ''[[Cortinarius meleagris|C.&nbsp;meleagris]]'' and ''[[Cortinarius subcastanellus|C.&nbsp;subcastanellus]]'', both also formerly of ''Rozites''.<ref name=peintner2002a/> Hence it has once more been placed within ''Cortinarius''.<ref name=peintner2002b/> Within the genus it is classified in the subgenus ''Cortinarius''.<ref name="Buczacki 2012"/>

[[Common name]]s include the gypsy mushroom,<ref name="Arora86" /> gypsy,<ref name="Buczacki 2012"/> and wrinkled rozites.<ref name="Lamaison05"/> In Finland, the common name is granny's nightcap.<ref name="Nilper"/>

== Description ==


''C.&nbsp;caperatus'' has a buff to brownish-ochre [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] {{Convert|5–12|cm|frac=4}} diameter,<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=635}}</ref> which is covered with whitish fibres. The surface has a wrinkled and furrowed texture.<ref name="Lamaison05" /> It may have a lilac tinge when young. It is convex initially before expanding and flattening with a boss ([[umbo (mycology)|umbo]]) in the centre. The stipe is {{Cvt|4–12|cm|frac=4}} long and {{Cvt|1–2.2|cm|frac=4}} thick; it is slightly swollen at the base, and whitish to beige with a noteworthy whitish [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]],<ref name="audu" /> which is initially attached to the cap.<ref name="Phillips06"/> The [[partial veil]] is a key identifying feature of the mushroom.<ref name="Courtecuisse 1999"/> The spores give an ochre-brown [[spore print]]. The warty almond-shaped spores measure 10–13&nbsp;[[μm]] long by 8–9&nbsp;μm wide. The [[context (mycology)|flesh]] is cream-coloured and the flavor mild.<ref name="Phillips06"/>

=== Similar species ===
Similar-looking North American species include ''[[Agrocybe praecox]]'', which lacks the wrinkled cap and is found in cultivated areas, and ''[[Phaeolepiota aurea]]'', which has a powdery-granular surface.<ref name="Arora86"/> Members of the ''Cortinarius'' subgenus ''Telamonia'' have thin rings and [[Cortinarius corrugatus|''C.&nbsp;corrugatus'']] has none, with a wrinkled cap.<ref name="audu" />

In central Europe, old specimens could be mistaken for the highly poisonous ''[[Inosperma erubescens]]'' in summer, and young mushrooms for the inedible ''[[Cortinarius traganus]]'', although the latter is readily distinguished by its unpleasant odour.<ref name="Zeitl76" />

== Distribution and habitat ==
''C.&nbsp;caperatus'' is found across northern Europe, mainly in Scandinavia, where it is common, although it is uncommon in Denmark and Iceland.<ref name=Nordic/> In the British Isles it is uncommon outside the [[Scottish Highlands]]<ref name="Nilper" /> and the [[New Forest]].<ref name=fungrec/> It has been classified as ''vulnerable'' in Germany and Great Britain and ''endangered'' in the Netherlands.<ref name=arnolds95/> ''C.&nbsp;caperatus'' had become less common in the vicinity of [[Salzburg]] in Austria between 1937 and 1988, thought due to picking.<ref name=Rücker88/>

It is widely found in northern parts of North America,<ref name="Arora86" /> as far south as [[Mendocino County]] on the west coast. It is uncommon in California.<ref name=siegel16/> ''C.&nbsp;caperatus'' is a rare component of [[subarctic]] areas of western Greenland.<ref name=Elborne1990/> The fungus also grows in temperate Asia, having been recorded growing with [[bilberry]] near oriental beech (''[[Fagus orientalis]]'') and fir near [[Pamukova]] in the [[Marmara Region]] of Turkey.<ref name=Akata15/> It is also found in boggy areas of the [[taiga]] (boreal pine forest) in western Siberia.<ref name=Filippova14/>

Fruiting bodies sprout from August to October in [[conifer]] and [[beech]] woods, as well as [[Ericaceae|heather]] (often close by [[sphagnum]]) in Scotland. It is [[mycorrhizae|mycorrhizal]] but non-selective in its hosts.<ref name="Nilper" /> Mushrooms appear from September to November in North America,<ref name="Baroni 2017"/> and July and August in Alaska.<ref name=Alaska/> It prefers [[Soil pH|acidic]] and sandy soils and avoids [[Calcareous|chalky]] ones,<ref name=Pegler/><!-- cites acidic, rest of sentence cited to Haas69 --> and may be found in the same habitats as bay bolete (''[[Imleria badia]]''), brown roll-rim (''[[Paxillus involutus]]''), and [[Cantharellus|chanterelles]].<ref name="Haas69"/> It forms relationships with Scots pine (''[[Pinus sylvestris]]'').<ref name=trappe62/> It is often found under Sitka spruce (''[[Picea sitchensis]]''),<ref name=siegel16/> or near [[huckleberry]] in North America.<ref name="Arora86" /> In Alaska it grows with dwarf birch (''[[Betula nana]]'') and American dwarf birch (''[[Betula glandulosa|B.&nbsp;glandulosa]]'').<ref name=Alaska/> In Greenland, it grows in association with white birch (''[[Betula pubescens|B.&nbsp;pubescens]]'').<ref name=Elborne1990/>

==Potential contamination==
The popularity of ''C.&nbsp;caperatus'' across Europe has led to safety concerns related to its propensity to accumulate contaminants.<ref name=Falandysz14/> Fungi are very efficient at absorbing radioactive [[isotope]]s of [[caesium]] from the soil and naturally have trace amounts of the element. Caesium may take the place of [[potassium]], which exists in high concentrations in mushrooms.<ref name=Falandysz16/> ''C.&nbsp;caperatus'' [[Radiotrophic fungus|bioaccumulates]] radioactive caesium [[Caesium-137|<sup>137</sup>Cs]]—a product of nuclear testing—much more than many other mushroom species. Levels dramatically rose after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]]. This is a potential health issue as picking and eating wild mushrooms is a popular pastime in central and eastern Europe. Elevated <sup>137</sup>Cs levels were also found in [[ruminant]]s that eat mushrooms in Scandinavia in the 1990s.<ref name=kalac01/><!-- cites previous 4 sentences --> Mushrooms from [[Reggio Emilia]] in Italy were found to have raised levels of [[Isotopes of caesium#Caesium-134|<sup>134</sup>Cs]].<ref name=Falandysz16/> ''C.&nbsp;caperatus'' from various sites across Poland has also been found to contain increased levels of [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].<ref name=Falandysz14/>

Additionally, picked mushrooms are often found to be infested with [[maggot]]s.<ref name="Haas69" />

== Edibility ==


''C.&nbsp;caperatus'' is a highly regarded [[edible mushroom]] with a mild to good flavour.<ref name="Miller 2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=299|author-link=Orson K. Miller Jr.}}</ref> It is said to mix well with stronger-flavoured fungi such as chanterelles, [[Boletus|boletes]], [[Russula|brittlegills]] or [[Lactarius (fungus)|milk-caps]].<ref name="Nilper" /> The mushroom can have a faintly bitter taste if eaten raw, but a pleasant nutty flavour when cooked.<ref name=Alaska/> It can readily be dried for later use, such as adding to soups and stews.<ref name="Lamaison05" /> It is sold commercially in Finland,<ref name=pelkonen/> and is a popular target of foragers in many parts of Europe.<ref name=Falandysz16/> Mycologist [[David Arora]] recommends discarding the tough stipes.<ref name="Arora86" />
