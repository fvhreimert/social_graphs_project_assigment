'''''Russula paludosa''''' is an edible species of [[fungus|mushroom]] within the large genus ''[[Russula]]''. It is common to Europe and North America.

==Description==

The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is convex to depressed and is coloured a distinctive bloody red, pink, crimson or purple. Sometimes it may show a yellowish or orange tinge in the centre. It may measure between 6 and 20&nbsp;cm in diameter. The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white with a mild taste and without scent; it quickly becomes soft and spongy and also greyish. The crowded [[Gill (mycology)|gills]] are cream coloured when young, and become yellow with age. They are adnexed and are generally thin. Their edges may sometimes occur reddish. The [[Amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]], elli [[spore]]s measure 8&ndash;10 by 7&ndash;10 [[Micrometre|μm]] are warty and are covered by an incomplete mesh. The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is white, sometimes with a pink hue, slightly clubbed. It may measure 5 to 15&nbsp;cm in height and up to 3&nbsp;cm in diameter.

==Distribution, ecology and habitat==
''R. paludosa'' is [[mycorrhizal]] and occurs in [[coniferous forest|coniferous woodland]]s and in peat bogs of Europe and North America; preferably under [[pine]] trees, where it forms mycorrhizae. Locally it can be very common.
