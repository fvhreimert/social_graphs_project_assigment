The fruiting body is shaped like a funnel expanded at the top, the stalk seamless with the cap, which is {{convert|0.5-8|cm|frac=4|abbr=off}} wide.<ref name="Arora1986" /> They grow up to about {{convert|10|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} in height,<ref name=Phillips/><ref name="Courtecuisse2"/><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The size of the elliptical spores is in the range of 8–11&nbsp;[[μm]] × 5–7&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Arora1986" /> The [[basidia]] are two-spored.

===Similar species===

''Craterellus cornucopioides'' has a smooth spore-bearing surface, but the rare, distantly related ''[[Cantharellus cinereus]]'' has rudimentary gills.<ref name="Bon"/>  The colour and smooth undersurface make ''C.&nbsp;cornucopioides'' very distinctive.<ref name=Arora1986/>

The forms ''[[Craterellus fallax]]'' (with a different spore colour ''en&nbsp;masse'') and ''[[Craterellus konradii|C.&nbsp;konradii]]'' (with a yellowish fruiting body) have been defined as separate species, but [[DNA profiling|DNA studies]] now show that the latter should be considered part of ''C.&nbsp;cornucopioides''.<ref name=Kuo2/><ref name=C_fallax/>

''[[Polyozellus multiplex]]'' has a purplish tint and ''[[Pseudocraterellus undulatus|Craterellus sinuosus]]'' tends to be more wrinkled beneath with yellower spores.<ref name=Arora1986/>

==In culture==
The [[Cornucopia]], in [[Greek mythology]], referred to the magnificent horn of the nymph [[Amalthea (mythology)|Amalthea]]'s goat (or of herself in goat form), that filled itself with whatever meat or drink its owner requested. It has become the symbol of plenty.

A possible origin for the name "trumpet of the dead" is that the growing mushrooms were seen as being played as trumpets by dead people under the ground.{{or|date=March 2024}} This name is translated to '''trompette de mort''' (French)<ref name=Arora1986/> and '''trompeta de la mort''' (Catalan).

It is one of several species that may be called ''[[djondjon]]'' in Haitian.
