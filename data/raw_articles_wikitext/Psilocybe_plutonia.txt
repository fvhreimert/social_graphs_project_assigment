'''''Psilocybe plutonia''''' is a small [[psilocybin mushroom]] of the family [[Hymenogastraceae]], believed to contain [[psilocybin]] and [[psilocin]]. It was first documented from [[Cuba]]. An older synonym is ''Agaricus plutonia''.

It is in the section ''[[Cordisporae]]''.

==Etymology==
The word plutonia comes from the [[Latin]] words plutonian or plutonic. Perhaps in connection with the dark color of the mushroom.

''Psilocybe plutonia'' may be found growing solitary or [[gregarious]], from late June through February, on rotted wood or in soil with woody material, in tropical forests, from [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Cuba]], often near sea level or in lower elevations, although widely distributed, it is not found often.
