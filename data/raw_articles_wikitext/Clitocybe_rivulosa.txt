'''''Clitocybe rivulosa''''', commonly known as the '''false champignon''' or '''fool's funnel''',  is a poisonous [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] of the large genus ''[[Clitocybe]]''. One of several species similar in appearance, it is a small white [[funnel]]-shaped [[toadstool]] widely found in lawns, meadows and other grassy areas in [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. Also known as the '''sweating mushroom''', it derives this name from the symptoms of poisoning ([[Cholinergic crisis|SLUDGE syndrome]]). It contains potentially deadly levels of [[muscarine]].

==Description==
A small whitish mushroom, the 3–4&nbsp;cm diameter [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is funnel-shaped with decurrent crowded white gills, with specks of pink. The fibrous [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is up to 4&nbsp;cm tall and bears no ring. The [[spore print]] is white. There is no distinctive taste or smell. It is one of a number of similar poisonous species, which can be confused with the edible fairy ring champignon (''[[Marasmius oreades]]'')<ref name="Carluccio03">{{cite book | author = Carluccio A | author-link = Antonio Carluccio | year = 2003 | title = The Complete Mushroom Book | publisher = Quadrille | isbn = 1-84400-040-0}}</ref> or miller (''[[Clitopilus prunulus]]''), such as the ivory funnel (''[[Clitocybe dealbata]]'') .<ref>{{cite book | author = Nilson S & Persson O | year = 1977 | title = Fungi of Northern Europe 2: Gill-Fungi | publisher = Penguin|isbn=0-14-063006-6|page= 98}}</ref>

When young and imbued with moisture, as with a small group of related ''Clitocybes ''such as ''[[Collybia phyllophila|C. phyllophila]],  ''the cap has a distinctive brownish translucent aspect with a "frosting" of white (which however is not superficial, but part of the flesh).  When it dries out it becomes uniform pure white, and it is more difficult to identify.  Thus it is [[hygrophanous]] in a way, but not to be confused with the smaller thin-fleshed ''Clitocybe'' species which are commonly characterized as hygrophanous.<ref name=Funga>{{cite book |last=Knudsen |first=Henning |author2=Jan Vesterhout |title=Funga Nordica |publisher=Nordsvamp |location=Copenhagen |year=2008 |page=392}}  As in other keys which could be used as references, the frosted appearance of the cap described in the article is used to distinguish this group of ''Clitocybes''.</ref>

==Taxonomy and naming==
It was initially described as ''Agaricus rivulosus'' by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1801,<ref>{{cite book | last = Persoon | first = Christian Hendrik | title = Synopsis Methodica Fungorum | year = 1801 | publisher = H. Dietrich | location = Göttingen | oclc = 28329773|language=la}}</ref> before German naturalist [[Paul Kummer]] gave it its current name in 1871.

The surface of the cap can develop concentric rings of cracks with age, and the species epithet ''rivulosa'' refers to this fissuring.

The very similar ''[[Clitocybe dealbata]]'' is sometimes regarded as part of the same species as ''C.&nbsp;rivulosa, ''and in that case the name ''rivulosa ''takes precedence and should be used for all these fungi.  If distinguished, it is on the basis that build is more robust, the gills are less decurrent and the margin has a tendency to crack up.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kuyper |first=Thomas W. |title=Some taxonomic and nomenclatural changes in the Tricholomataceae, tribus Clitocybeae |journal=Persoonia |volume=16–2 |year=1996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book  | last = Bon | first = Marcel | title = Flore mycologique d'Europe 4 Les clitocybes, omphales et ressemblants | publisher = M. Bon | location = Quai Jeanne d'Arc, 80230 St. Valéry-sur-Somme, France  |date=April 1997 | page = 61 |language=fr}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==
The false champignon is found in grassy habitats in summer and autumn in Europe and North America, where it can often form [[fairy ring]]s; individual mushrooms nestled in the grass which often grows richer and greener where they occur.<ref>{{cite book | author = Haas H | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi |pages=132| publisher = Burke | isbn = 0-222-79409-7}}</ref>  They often occur in grassy areas where they may be encountered by children or toddlers. This may increase risk of accidental consumption.<ref name="Benjamin95">{{cite book | author = Benjamin DR | year = 1995 | title = Mushrooms, Poisons and Panaceas: A Handbook for Naturalists, Mycologists, and Physicians | publisher = W H Freeman & Co | isbn = 0-7167-2649-1}}</ref>

==Toxicity==
The main toxin in ''Clitocybe rivulosa'' is [[muscarine]], and thus the symptoms are somewhat like that of nerve agent exposure, namely, greatly increased [[saliva]]tion, [[perspiration]] (sweating), and [[lacrimation]] (tear production) within 15–30&nbsp;minutes of ingestion. With large doses, these symptoms may be followed by [[Abdomen|abdominal]] pain, severe [[nausea]], [[diarrhea]], blurred vision, and labored breathing. Intoxication generally subsides within two hours. [[Death]] is rare, but may result from [[respiratory failure]] in severe cases. The specific [[antidote]] is [[atropine]].<ref name="Benjamin95"/>
