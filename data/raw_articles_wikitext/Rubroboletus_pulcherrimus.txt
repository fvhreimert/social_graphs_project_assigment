It is a large [[bolete]] from Western North America with distinguishing features that include a netted surface on the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], a red to brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and stem color, and red pores that stain blue upon injury.

The species is [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] and potentially fatal, having been implicated in at least one death.

==Taxonomy==
American mycologists [[Harry D. Thiers]] and Roy E. Halling were aware of confusion on the west coast of North America over red-pored boletes; two species were traditionally recognised— ''[[Boletus satanas]]'' and ''[[Boletus eastwoodiae|B.&nbsp;eastwoodiae]]''. However, they strongly suspected the type specimen of the latter species was in fact the former. In reviewing material they published a new name for the taxon, which Thiers had written about in local guidebooks as ''B. eastwoodiae'', as they felt that name to be invalid. Hence in 1976 they formally described ''Boletus pulcherrimus'',<ref name=Thiers1976/><!-- cites previous 3 sentences --> from the [[Latin]] ''pulcherrimus'', meaning "very pretty".<ref>{{Cite book|author = Simpson DP.| title = Cassell's Latin Dictionary | publisher = Cassell Ltd.| year = 1979|edition = 5|location = London|page = 883| isbn=978-0-304-52257-6}}</ref> It was transferred to the genus ''[[Rubroboletus]]'' in 2015 along with several other allied reddish colored, blue-staining bolete species such as ''Rubroboletus eastwoodiae'' and ''Rubroboletus satanas''.<ref name="Frank 2015">{{cite journal |author=Frank JL. |title=Nomenclatural novelties |journal=Index Fungorum |issue=248 |date=June 11, 2015 |url=http://www.indexfungorum.org/Publications/Index%20Fungorum%20no.248.pdf}}</ref>

Colored various shades of olive- to reddish-brown, the cap may sometimes reach {{convert|25|cm|0|sp=us}} in diameter and is convex in shape before flattening at maturity.

===Microscopic characters===

The [[basidiospore|spores]] are spindle-shaped or elliptical, thick-walled, smooth, and have dimensions of 13–16 by 5.5–6.5&nbsp;[[μm]]. The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are club-shaped (clavate), attached to 1 to 4 spores, and have dimensions of 35–90 by 9–12&nbsp;μm. The [[cystidia]] (sterile, non-spore-bearing cells found interspersed among the basidia) in the [[hymenium]] have dimensions of 33–60 by 8–12&nbsp;μm. [[Clamp connection]]s are absent in the [[hypha]]e of ''B.&nbsp;pulcherrimus''.<ref name=Thiers1976/>

===Similar species===
Although the relatively large fruiting bodies of ''R.&nbsp;pulcherrimus'' are distinctive, they might be confused with superficially similar species, such as ''[[Rubroboletus eastwoodiae|R.&nbsp;eastwoodiae]]''; the latter species has a much thicker stalk. Another similar species is ''[[Rubroboletus haematinus|R.&nbsp;haematinus]]'', which may be distinguished by its yellower stem and cap colors that are various shades of brown.<ref name=Arora1991>{{Cite book|author=Arora D. |title=All that the Rain Promises and more: a Hip Pocket Guide to Western Mushrooms |publisher=Ten Speed Press |location=Berkeley, Calif |year=1991 |page=167 |isbn=978-0-89815-388-0}}</ref> Its darker cap and lack of reticulation on the stipe differentiate it from ''R.&nbsp;satanas''.<ref name=Thiers1976/> ''[[Neoboletus luridiformis]]'' grow with oaks but is smaller and have non-reticulate stipe.

==Distribution and habitat==


''Rubroboletus pulcherrimus'' is found in western North America, from [[New Mexico]] and [[California]] to [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and may feasibly occur in [[British Columbia]], Canada.

==Toxicity==
In general, blue-staining red-pored boletes should be avoided for consumption.<ref name=Tylutki1987II/> Thiers warned that this species might be toxic after being alerted to severe [[gastrointestinal symptom]]s in one who had merely tasted it.<ref name=Thiers75>{{Cite book|title=California Mushrooms—A Field Guide to the Boletes |author=Thiers HD. |year=1975 |publisher=Hafner Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-02-853410-7}}</ref> In 1994, a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus and the husband died as a result.
