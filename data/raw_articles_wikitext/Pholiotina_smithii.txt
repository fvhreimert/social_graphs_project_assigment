'''''Conocybula cyanopus''''' is a species of fungus that contains [[psychoactive]] compounds including [[psilocybin]]<ref name="Ammirati-073"/> and the uncommon [[aeruginascin]].<ref name="Halama 2015"/><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gotvaldova |first1=Klara |last2=Borovicka |first2=Jan |last3=Hajkova |first3=Katerina |last4=Cihlarova |first4=Petra |last5=Rockefeller |first5=Alan |last6=Kuchar |first6=Martin |year=2022 |title=Extensive Collection of Psychotropic Mushrooms with Determination of Their Tryptamine Alkaloids |journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences |volume=23 |issue=22 |language=en |article-number=14068 |doi=10.3390/ijms232214068 |pmid=36430546 |pmc=9693126 |issn=1422-0067|doi-access=free }}</ref> Originally described as ''Galerula cyanopus'' by American mycologist [[George Francis Atkinson]] in 1918.

Song in 2024.  ''Conocybula cyanopus'' is recognized as the [[type species]] of ''Conocybula sect. Cyanopodae''.<ref name="Conocybula">{{cite web | title=Resolving the polyphyletic origins of Pholiotina s.l.

While the taxon ''Conocybula smithii'' has sometimes been considered as a [[junior synonym]] of ''Conocybula cyanopus'', this much more common species differs by its distribution, DNA barcode, length of its [[cheilocystidia]] and [[pileocystidia]].<ref name="Conocybula"></ref>

==Description==
''Conocybula cyanopus'' is a small [[saprotrophic]] [[mushroom]] with a [[conic]] to broadly [[wikt:convex|convex]] cap which is smooth and colored ocher to cinnamon brown. It is usually less than 25&nbsp;mm across and the margin is [[wikt:striate|striate]], often with fibrous remnants of the partial veil. The gills are [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] and close, colored cinnamon brown with whitish edges near the margin, darkening in age. The [[spores]] are cinnamon brown, smooth and [[ellipsoid]] with a [[germ pore]], measuring 8&nbsp;×&nbsp;5 micrometers. The [[cheilocystidia]] are shorter than 50 μm and [[pileocystidia]] measure less than 70 μm, differentiating it from the closely related [[Conocybula smithii]] which has longer [[cheilocystidia]] and much longer [[pileocystidia]].<ref name="Conocybula"></ref> The stem is smooth and fragile, whitish at the bottom and brownish at the top, 2–4&nbsp;cm long, 1 to 1.5&nbsp;mm thick, and is equal width for most of the length, often swelling at the base.  The stem lacks an [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]] (ring) and the base usually stains blue. The cap color lightens when it dries, turning a tan color.

Like some other grassland species such as ''[[Psilocybe semilanceata]]'', ''[[Psilocybe mexicana]]'' and ''[[Psilocybe tampanensis]]'', ''Conocybula cyanopus''  may form [[sclerotia]], a dormant form of the organism, which affords it some protection from wildfires and other natural disasters.<ref name="Stamets1996"/>

==Distribution and habitat==

''Conocybula cyanopus'' grows in lawns, fields, and grassy areas in [[temperate]] areas of North America, Europe and Asia.<ref name="worldwide"/><ref name=Hausknecht2009/> It can be found in Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine and the United States.<ref name="worldwide"/><ref name=Hausknecht2009/><ref name="Halama 2015"/> It has also been reported from the United Kingdom but these reports are doubtful.<ref name="Halama 2015"/> Within Canada, it has been found in [[British Columbia]] and [[Quebec]].<ref name="worldwide"/><ref name="Halama 2015"/> Within the United States, it has been found in [[Colorado]], [[Michigan]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].<ref name="worldwide"/><ref name="Halama 2015"/> Within Russia, it has been found in the [[Sakha Republic]] and the [[Sikhote-Alin]] mountains and .<ref name=Hausknecht2009/><ref name="Halama 2015"/> It is rare where it occurs.<ref name="worldwide"/>

==Edibility==

''Conocybula cyanopus'' is hallucinogenic, containing [[psilocin]], [[psilocybin]], [[baeocystin]], [[norbaeocystin]] and [[aeruginascin]].<ref name="Halama 2015"/><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Gotvaldova |first1=Klara |last2=Borovicka |first2=Jan |last3=Hajkova |first3=Katerina |last4=Cihlarova |first4=Petra |last5=Rockefeller |first5=Alan |last6=Kuchar |first6=Martin |year=2022 |title=Extensive Collection of Psychotropic Mushrooms with Determination of Their Tryptamine Alkaloids |journal=International Journal of Molecular Sciences |volume=23 |issue=22 |language=en |article-number=14068 |doi=10.3390/ijms232214068 |pmid=36430546 |pmc=9693126 |issn=1422-0067|doi-access=free }}</ref> Paul Stamets stated in 1996 that fruit bodies of ''Co. cyanopus'' have been found to contain anywhere from 0.33 to 1.01% (of dry weight) psilocybin, 0–0.007% psilocin, and 0.12–0.20% baeocystin.<ref name="Stamets1996"/> A more recent study found a collection of ''Co. cyanopus'' from Poland to contain 0.90±0.08% psilocybin, 0.17±0.01% psilocin, 0.16±0.01% baeocystin, 0.053±0.004% norbaeocystin and 0.011±0.0007% aeruginascin.<ref name="Halama 2015"/> Most [[mycologists]] advise against eating this mushroom because it is easy to mistake with deadly poisonous species (e.g. ''[[Pholiotina rugosa]]'', ''[[Cortinarius gentilis]]'' or ''[[Galerina marginata]]''.

==Legality==
{{Main|Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms}}
The legal status of psilocybin mushrooms varies worldwide. Psilocybin and psilocin are listed as [[Class A drugs|Class A]] (United Kingdom) or [[Controlled Substances Act#Schedule I controlled substances|Schedule I]] (US) drugs under the [[United Nations]] 1971 [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref name=INCB/> The possession and use of psilocybin mushrooms, including ''Co.&nbsp;cyanopus'', is therefore prohibited by extension. However, in many national, state, and provincial drug laws, there is a great deal of ambiguity about the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms and the spores of these mushrooms. For more details on the legal status of psilocybin mushrooms and their spores, see: [[Legal status of psilocybin mushrooms]].
