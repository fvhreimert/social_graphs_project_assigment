'''''Inosperma cookei''''', [[common name|commonly known]] as the '''straw fibrecap''', is a species of [[mushroom]] in the family [[Inocybaceae]]. It was first described in 1892 by [[Giacomo Bresadola]], and is named in honour of [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]]. The species is found in Europe, Asia, and North America. It produces small mushrooms of an [[ochre]] colour, with a prominent [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], fibres on the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] and a distinctive bulb at the base of the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. It grows from soil in [[mixed forest|mixed woodland]], and is encountered in summer and autumn, though is not common. Ecologically, it feeds through use of [[ectomycorrhiza]]. ''Inosperma cookei'' has been described as both [[mushroom poisoning|toxic]] and non-toxic, but either way, is not advised for consumption.

A 2019 multigene phylogenetic study by Matheny and colleagues found that ''I. cookei'' and its relatives in the subgenus ''Inosperma'' were only distantly related to the other members of the genus ''Inocybe''. ''[[Inosperma]]'' was raised to genus rank and the species became ''Inosperma cookei''.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00275514.2019.1668906|title=Genera of Inocybaceae: New skin for the old ceremony|year=2020|last1=Matheny|first1=P.

==Description==
''Inosperma cookei'' has a conical or bell-shaped [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of between {{convert|2|and|5|cm|in}} in diameter. As the mushrooms age, the cap becomes flatter, and an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]] becomes prominent. The margin of the cap frequently cracks towards the centre. The cap is an [[ochre]] colour, and the upper surface is covered in long fibres.<ref name="Phillips"/> The silky fibres thickly cover the cap, starting and the centre and extending to the cap's margin.<ref name="Jordan"/> The species has a whitish or ochre [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] of {{convert|30|to|60|mm|in}} in height by {{convert|4|to|8|mm|in}} in thickness.<ref name="Phillips"/> There is a distinctive [[wikt:marginate|marginate]] bulb at the base of the stem,<ref name="Kibby"/> and no [[Annulus (mycology)|ring]].<ref name="Jordan"/> The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white, becoming yellow with age.<ref name="Jordan"/> ''Inosperma cookei'' mushrooms have closely packed adnexed [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] (gills that are attached to the stem only on part of their depth).<ref name="Phillips">{{cite book |title= Mushrooms and Other Fungi of Great Britain and Europe|author= Phillips, Roger|year= 1981|publisher= [[Pan Books]]|location= London|isbn= 0-330-26441-9|page=149}}</ref><ref name="Pegler"/> Gills on young mushrooms are whitish, then become a grey-tinged pale ochre before becoming [[cinnamon]] yellow.<ref name="Jordan"/>

===Microscopic features===
''Inosperma cookei'' leaves a [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]]-brown [[spore print]]. The [[spore]]s themselves are [[bean]]-shaped,<ref name="Phillips"/> measuring from {{convert|5.5|to|10|um}} by {{convert|4|to|6|um}}. The walls of the spores (which are around {{convert|0.5|um}} thick) can be smooth or slightly wrinkled, and there is a distinct depression just above the hilum (the scar where the spore was once attached to the [[basidium]]).<ref name="Kew">{{cite journal |title=Basidiospore form in the British species of ''Inocybe'' |author1=Pegler, D.N. |author2=Young, T.W.K. |journal=Kew Bulletin |year=1972 |pages=499–537 |volume=26 |issue=3 |doi=10.2307/4120316|jstor=4120316 }}</ref> The basidia are four-spored, and the thin-walled, gill-edge [[cheilocystidia]] are pear-shaped.<ref name="Jordan"/>
