'''''Lactifluus piperatus''''' ([[Synonyms (taxonomy)|synonym]] '''''Lactarius piperatus'''''), commonly known as the '''blancaccio''', is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus of the genus ''[[Lactifluus]]''. It was the original [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'', before being moved to ''Lactifluus''.

The fruiting body is a creamy-white mushroom which is funnel-shaped when mature, with exceptionally crowded [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. It bleeds a whitish peppery-tasting [[latex|milk]] when cut. Widely distributed across Europe and eastern North America, ''L.&nbsp;piperatus'' has been accidentally introduced to Australia. [[Mycorrhiza]]l, it forms a symbiotic relationship with various species of deciduous tree, including [[beech]], and [[hazel]], and fruiting bodies are found on the forest floor in [[deciduous]] woodland.

Despite often being considered [[Edible mushroom|edible]], it reportedly contains toxins and has a poor flavor, but can be used as a seasoning when dried.

==Taxonomy==
The species was one of many named by [[Carl Linnaeus]], who officially described it in Volume Two of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753) as ''Agaricus piperatus'',<ref name="Linnaeus1753" /> the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] deriving from the [[Latin]] adjective ''piperatus'', meaning "peppery".<ref name="Simpson1979" /> For many years, Tyrolian naturalist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] was considered the author of the first description, until a 1987 revision of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] began considering primary works describing fungi from as far back as 1753, instead of only 1821 (based on the work of Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]]).<ref name="Esser1994" />

''Lactifluus piperatus'' was the original [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]''. However, after the finding that ''Lactarius'' actually represented more than one genus,<ref name=Buyck2008/> the species ''[[Lactarius torminosus]]'' was conserved as type for that genus.<ref name=Buyck2010/><ref name="Norvell2011"/><ref name="Barrie2011"/> Thus, ''L.&nbsp;piperatus'' is now the type species of ''Lactifluus'', which was split from ''Lactarius'' and contains mainly tropical milk-caps, but also some species of the north temperate zone.<ref name="verbeken2013"/> [[Phylogenetic]] research showed that [[Lactifluus glaucescens|''L.&nbsp;glaucescens'']], sometimes considered only a variety of ''L.&nbsp;piperatus'', is a distinct species in Europe.<ref name=DeCrop2014/> Furthermore, the existence of at least ten lineages worldwide, with no overlap among continents, was shown for the group around ''L.&nbsp;piperatus'', suggesting that populations in North America might actually be distinct species.<ref name=DeCrop2014/>

It is commonly known as the peppery milk cap,<ref name="Phillips1981"/> pepper milkcap,<ref name=Peterson1998/> peppery Lactarius,<ref name="Marshall2003"/> peppery milk mushroom,<ref name="Russell2006"/> white peppery milk-cap, or other similar names. Similarly, in German it is known as the ''Pfeffermilchling'' ("pepper milk cap").<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/>

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|6-16|cm|frac=4}} across, convex, and depressed in the center; it is creamy-white (staining tannish in age),<ref name="Arora1986" /> [[Glabrousness|glabrous]] but not glossy; it may crack in dry areas.<ref name=Haas1969/> The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white in colour, smooth,<ref name="Pegler1983"/> {{convert|2-8|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1-3|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} thick,<ref name="Arora1986" /> and cylindrical, sometimes tapering towards the base.<ref name="Phillips1981"/> There is a thick layer of firm white flesh, and the [[decurrent]] [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are particularly crowded and narrow, sharing the white colouration of the stem but becoming creamy with age.<ref name="Phillips1981"/><ref name="Pegler1983"/> As with other species of ''Lactarius'',<ref name="Phillips1981"/> there is abundant milk ([[latex]]), which is white,<ref name="Pegler1983"/> and dries olive-green.<ref name=Laessoe1998/> It has a white [[spore print]] with [[wikt:elongate|elongate]], [[elliptic]] or [[amyloid]] [[spore]]s which are ornamented, as with ''[[Lactifluus vellereus|L.&nbsp;vellereus]]''. The spores measure from 4.5&ndash;9.5 by 5&ndash;8&nbsp;[[μm]], are roundish to elliptical,<ref name="Arora1986" /> and have tiny warts.<ref name="Phillips1981"/><ref name="Pegler1983"/>

'' is similar but has a stouter stipe and a large, woolly cap.]]
=== Similar species ===

''L. vellereus'' is larger with a thick stipe, woolly cap and less crowded gills,<ref name=Zeitlmayr1976/> but is not as tall.<ref name="Phillips1981"/> ''[[Russula delica]]'' is similar in colour and shape, though has adnate blue-green tinged gills and no milk.<ref name=Haas1969/> ''[[Lactifluus deceptivus|L.&nbsp;deceptivus]]'' is also similar, but is differentiated by its less crowded gills, firmer cap margin and less acrid milk.<ref name=Roody2003/> Close to ''L.&nbsp;piperatus'' is ''[[Lactifluus glaucescens|L.&nbsp;glaucescens]]'', which is differentiated by its milk that dries with a greenish colour.<ref name="urlKuo"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Lactifluus piperatus'' in the wide sense, i.e. including probably several species,<ref name=DeCrop2014/> is found in Europe,<ref name="Phillips1981"/> the [[Black Sea]] region in northeastern [[Turkey]],<ref name=Sesli2007/> and eastern and central North America east of [[Minnesota]].<ref name=Arora1986/> It has been accidentally introduced into [[Australasia]], where it is found under introduced and native trees.<ref name="Hall2003"/><ref name=Fuhrer2005/> It is found on the floor in [[deciduous]] woodland, particularly under [[beech]] (''Fagus''), and can be found throughout summer and autumn and into early winter.<ref name="Phillips1981"/><ref name=Haas1969/> It is relatively common, though not as common as the similar ''L.&nbsp;vellereus''.<ref name="Phillips1981"/> ''L.&nbsp;piperatus'' is found solitarily or in scattered groups.<ref name="Jordan2004"/> It is sometimes found growing together with ''[[Russula cyanoxantha]]''.<ref name=Haas1969/>

==Ecology==
It is a common food source for [[red squirrel]]s.<ref name="Camazine1984" /> It is one of several species parasitized by ''[[Hypomyces lactifluorum]]'' (the lobster mushroom).<ref name="Arora1986" />

==Edibility==
The species contains [[Mycotoxin|toxins]], but despite being described by some authors as inedible<ref name="Jordan2004" /> or even [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]],<ref name="Hall2003" /><ref name="Miller2006">{{cite book|last1=Miller Jr.|first1=Orson K.|title=North American Mushrooms: A Field Guide to Edible and Inedible Fungi|last2=Miller|first2=Hope H.|publisher=[[FalconGuide]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7627-3109-1|location=Guilford, CN|pages=97}}</ref> ''Lactifluus piperatus'' is often considered [[Edible mushroom|edible]].<ref name="Phillips1981" /><ref name="Marshall2003" /><ref name="Pegler1983" /> It is not recommended by some owing simply to its unpleasant taste.<ref name="Phillips1981" /> It is difficult to digest when eaten raw, but is used as a seasoning when dried; it is also sometimes eaten fresh after [[parboiling]], though its taste is still unappetising.<ref name="Phillips1981" /> Some recommend [[frying]] it in butter with bacon and onion,<ref name="Zeitlmayr1976" /> [[pickling]] it,<ref name="Russell2006" /> or baking it in a pie or pastry.<ref name="Haas1969" /> The milk has a very hot and acrid taste,<ref name="Phillips1981" /> which is removed if boiled.<ref name="Pegler1983" /> The mushroom used to be highly regarded in [[Russia]],<ref name="Molokhovets1992" /> where it would be picked in dry seasons when other edible species were less available.<ref name="Pegler1983" /> The mushroom is also popular in [[Finland]], where cooks boil it repeatedly (disposing of the water each time), and then store it in salt water and refrigerate it, then pickle it or serve it in salads.<ref name="urlKuo" /> When eaten fresh and raw, the mushroom has been known to cause an [[Irritation|irritant reaction]] on the lips and tongue, which subsides after an hour.<ref name="Spoerke1994" /> The close ''L.&nbsp;glaucescens'' has been reported to be poisonous,<ref name="Metzler1992" /> but it has been speculated that the "poisonings" were caused by the extremely strong, peppery taste, rather than by the presence of actual poisons.<ref name="urlKuo" />

When parasitized by the lobster mushroom, ''L.&nbsp;piperatus'' forms part of an unusual and highly regarded dish in North America. Once colonized by the parasite, an orange-red crust forms over the surface of the mushroom, and the taste becomes delicious as the parasite infiltrates its host's tissues.<ref name="Arora1986" />

==Other uses==
Because of the presence of [[auxin]]s in ''L.&nbsp;piperatus'' [[metabolite]]s, it can be applied as a [[Cutting (plant)|rooting hormone]] to aid the growth of seedlings of various species of plants, including [[hazel]], [[beech]] and [[oak]].<ref name=Mohan1999/> In the 19th century, it was used as a [[folk medicine|folk cure]] for [[tuberculosis]], though it had no effect.<ref name=Rolfe1974/> In more recent times, it has been found that ''L.&nbsp;piperatus'' can be used as an [[Antiviral drug|antiviral]] agent, and the latex has been used against viral [[wart]]s.<ref name=Hoffman1999/>
