'''''Sarcoscypha occidentalis''''', commonly known as the '''stalked scarlet cup''' or the '''western scarlet cup''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Sarcoscyphaceae]] of the [[Pezizales]] order. [[Phylogenetic]] analysis has shown that it is most closely related to other ''[[Sarcoscypha]]'' species that contain large oil droplets in their [[spore]]s. ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' has an [[Fungi imperfecti|imperfect]] form ([[Asexual reproduction|reproducing asexually]]), classified as ''Molliardiomyces occidentalis''.

The [[Ascocarp|fruit bodies]] have small, bright red cups up to {{convert|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} wide atop a slender whitish [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] up to {{convert|1|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long. The species is distinguished from the related ''[[Sarcoscypha coccinea|S.&nbsp;coccinea]]'' and ''[[Sarcoscypha austriaca|S.&nbsp;austriaca]]'' by differences in distribution, fruiting season, and structure. The fungus can be found in North America and Asia. A [[saprobic]] species, it is found growing on [[hardwood]] twigs, particularly those that are partially buried in moist and shaded [[humus]]-rich soil.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus, originally collected from [[Muskingum County, Ohio]], was named ''Peziza occidentalis'' by [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]] in 1832.<ref name="Schweinitz1832" /> It was assigned its current name by  [[Pier Andrea Saccardo]] in 1888.<ref name="Saccardo1888" /> [[Andrew Price Morgan]] renamed the species ''Geopyxis occidentalis'' in 1902 because of a perceived similarity with ''[[Geopyxis hesperidea]]'',<ref name="Morgan1902" /> but the name change was not adopted by subsequent authors. In 1928, [[Fred Jay Seaver]] overturned Saccardo's naming and applied the name ''Plectania'' to ''[[Sarcoscypha coccinea]]'' and other red cup fungi.<ref name="Seaver1928" /> In later [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] revisions, [[Richard P. Korf]] reinstated the genus name ''[[Sarcoscypha]]''.<ref name="Korf1953" /><ref name="Korf1972" />

===Phylogeny===

The [[phylogenetic]] relationships in the genus ''Sarcoscypha'' were analyzed by Francis Harrington in the late 1990s.<ref name=Harrington1998/><ref name=Harrington1997/> The [[cladistics|cladistic]] analysis combined comparison of [[DNA sequence|sequences]] from the [[internal transcribed spacer]] in the non-functional [[RNA]] with fifteen traditional [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] characters, such as [[spore]] features, fruit body shape, and degree of hair curliness. Based on this analysis, ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' is part of a [[clade]] of evolutionarily related taxa that includes the species ''[[Sarcoscypha dudleyi|S.&nbsp;dudleyi]]'', ''[[Sarcoscypha emarginata|S.&nbsp;emarginata]]'', ''[[Sarcoscypha hosoyae|S.&nbsp;hosoyae]]'', ''[[Sarcoscypha korfiana|S.&nbsp;korfiana]]'' and ''[[Sarcoscypha mesocyatha|S.&nbsp;mesocyatha]]''.<ref name=Harrington1998/> All of these species contain large oil droplets in their spores, in contrast to the other major clade of ''Sarcoscypha'' (containing the [[type species]] ''S.&nbsp;coccinea''), characterized by having smaller, more numerous droplets.<ref name=Harrington1997/> The species most closely related to ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' is ''S.&nbsp;mesocyatha'', known only from [[Hawaii]].<ref name=Hemmes2002/>

=== Subdivision ===
A Jamaican [[variety (botany)|variety]] has been named (as ''Plectania occidentalis'' var. ''jamaicensis''); it has a pinker hymenium.<ref name="Dennis1954" />

==== Anamorph form ====
Anamorphic or [[fungi imperfecti|imperfect fungi]] are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their [[biological life cycle|life cycle]], and typically reproduce by the process of [[mitosis]] in structures called [[conidia]]. In some cases, the sexual stage—or [[teleomorph, anamorph and holomorph|teleomorph]] stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph.

The anamorphic state of ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' is ''Molliardiomyces occidentalis'', described by [[John W. Paden]]. This form produces smooth, colorless [[conidiophore]]s (specialized stalks that bear conidia) measuring 20–230 by 2–3.2&nbsp;μm. The conidia are roughly spherical to [[wikt:ovoid|ovoid]], smooth, translucent ([[hyaline]]), and 4.6–7.0 by 3.0–3.8&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Paden1984" />

=== Etymology ===
The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''occidentalis'', derived from the [[Latin]] word for "western", may refer to the distribution of the species in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the stalked scarlet cup<ref name="Roody2003" /> or the western scarlet cup.<ref name="McKnight1987" />

==Description==
Depending on their age, the fruit bodies of ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' may range in shape from deep cups to saucers to discs in maturity, and they can reach diameters up to {{convert|2|cm|abbr=off|frac=8}}. In young specimens, the edges of the cup are curled inwards, and crenulate (with small rounded scallops); the cup edges in older specimens become laciniate (with jagged edges cut into irregular segments). The cups rest atop a [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] that is small to medium-sized, up to {{convert|30|mm|in|1|frac=4}} long and 1.5–2&nbsp;mm thick,<ref name=Harrington1990/> and attached centrally or to the side to the underside of the cup. The base of the stem may be covered with translucent "hairs".<ref name=Kanouse1948/> The fertile spore-bearing inner surface of the cups, the [[hymenium]], is bright red but fades to yellow or orange when dry. It is smooth or becomes so with time.<ref name=Denison1972/> The fruit bodies are fleshy to rubbery when fresh, but become leathery when dry.<ref name=Harrington1990/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and has no distinctive odor or taste, nor culinary value.<ref name=Roody2003/>


''Excipulum'' is a term used to refer to the tissue or tissues containing the hymenium of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30&nbsp;[[μm]] thickness), made of a tissue type known as ''texura porrecta'', consisting of more or less parallel [[hypha]]e all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary excipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600&nbsp;μm) and made of ''textura intricata'', a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The [[ascus|asci]] (filamentous structures in which the [[ascospore]]s develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15&nbsp;μm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12&nbsp;μm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The [[paraphyses]] (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the hymenium) are cylindrical, 2–3&nbsp;μm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes [[anastomosis|anastomose]], but do not form a conspicuous network.<ref name=Denison1972/> The paraphyses contain numerous red [[granule (cell biology)|granules]].<ref name=Healy2008/>

''S. occidentalis'' is frequently confused with ''S.&nbsp;coccinea'', but is distinguished macroscopically from this species by its smaller fruit bodies, smaller spores, and less hairy exterior. The two also differ in seasonal and geographic distribution: ''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' fruits from late spring to early autumn in the United States, while ''S.&nbsp;coccinea'' fruits earlier in spring,<ref name="Harrington1990" /> and is distributed in eastern North America, in the midwest, in the valleys between the Pacific coast and the Sierras and Cascades, as well as Europe, Africa, Australia, and India.<ref name=Denison1972/> Another eastern North American species, ''[[Sarcoscypha austriaca|S.&nbsp;austriaca]]'', has scarlet fruit bodies up to {{convert|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=2}} wide, and fruits in early spring.<ref name=Miller2006/>

''S.&nbsp;occidentalis'' may also be mistaken for ''[[Microstoma floccosum]]'', which occurs in the same habitat. ''M.&nbsp;floccosum'', however, has taller cups and is covered with stiff white hairs.<ref name=Seaver1904/> Another cup-fungus, ''[[Scutellinia scutellata]]'', is disc-shaped without a stem, and is fringed with black hairs around its rim.<ref name=Roody2003/> ''[[Melastiza]]'' species usually lack stems and ''[[Phillipsia domingensis]]'' produces purplish or dark red cups with white undersides.<ref>{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=45}}</ref>

==Distribution and habitat==

The fungus is found in North America east of the [[Rocky Mountains]], and at higher elevations in [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]].<ref name="Denison1972" /> It has also been collected in Japan<ref name="Nagao2002" /> and Taiwan.<ref name="Liou1977" />

As a [[saprobic]] fungus, ''S. occidentalis'' is part of a community of fungi that play an important role in the forest ecosystem by breaking down the complex insoluble molecules [[cellulose]] and [[lignin]] of wood and leaf litter into smaller [[oligosaccharide]]s that may be used by a variety of microbes.<ref name="Edwards2008" /> Fruit bodies of ''S.&nbsp;coccinea'' may grow either solitarily, scattered or grouped together on sticks, twigs, and fragments of dead wood,<ref name="Denison1972" /> usually somewhat decomposed and partially buried in the top {{convert|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=2}} of soil and forest litter. It prefers soil that is moist and shaded and has a high content of [[humus]]. Like all ''Sarcoscypha'' species, it prefers the wood of [[angiosperm]]s, such as [[oak]], [[maple]], and [[basswood]];<ref name="Harrington1990" /> one field guide notes a preference for [[shagbark hickory]].<ref name="Healy2008" />
