==Description==
*The '''cap''' is 1 — 2.5&nbsp;cm [[wikt:convex|convex]] to nearly plane, and is sometimes broadly [[wikt:umbonate|umbonate]] but not [[wikt:papillate|papillate]]. It is smooth, dull grayish brown to slightly [[wiktionary:olivaceus|olivaceus]], more reddish at the center, [[hygrophanous]], and becoming straw brown when dry with the center remaining more brownish. It sometimes has a bluish green tone, or olivacous tones at the margin when young.
*The '''gills''' are [[adnexed]], subdistant, broad, and dark chocolate brown to purplish brown with age.
*The '''spores''' are dark purple brown, [[ellipsoid]], and 13 — 14.5 by 7.5 — 8.8(10)[[μm]].
*The '''stipe''' is 1.4 — 3.0&nbsp;cm by 1 – 2&nbsp;mm, equal, enlarging at the base. It is whitish to very pale brownish, darker below, bruising blue, and finely fibrillose in the lower portion. The partial veil is thin and soon disappears.
*The '''taste''' is weak to somewhat [[farinaceous]]; The '''odor''' is strongly aromatic to [[farinaceous]].
*'''Microscopic features''': The [[basidium|basidia]] are 4-spored and [[pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] are absent. The [[cheilocystidia]] are 22 — 33 by 5.5 — 9 [[μm]], [[wikt:lageniform|lageniform]] and have an extended neck.

==Habitat and formation==
''Psilocybe cubensis liniformans'' var. ''americana'' is found scattered to [[wikt:gregarious|gregarious]] in rich pastures or grasslands, fruiting from summer to early winter. It has been collected in [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[Michigan]], and has also been reported from [[Chile]] where it fruits in the spring.
This mushroom is very close to the type variety; the main difference is the lack of a gelatinous layer on the edge of the [[lamella (mycology)|lamella]]e and the [[wikt:terricolous|terricolous]] habitat.
