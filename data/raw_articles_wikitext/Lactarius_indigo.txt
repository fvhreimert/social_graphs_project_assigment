'''''Lactarius indigo''''', commonly known as the '''indigo milk cap''', '''indigo milky''', '''indigo lactarius''', '''blue lactarius''', or '''blue milk mushroom''', is a species of [[agarics|agaric fungus]] in the family [[Russulaceae]].

The [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] color ranges from dark blue in fresh specimens to pale blue-gray in older ones. The milk, or [[latex]], that oozes when the mushroom tissue is cut or broken (a feature common to all members of the genus ''[[Lactarius (fungus)|Lactarius]]'') is also [[indigo]] blue, but slowly turns green upon exposure to air. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] has a diameter of {{convert|4|–|15|cm|0|abbr=on}}, and the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|2|–|8|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} tall and {{convert|1|–|2.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick.

It is a widely distributed species, growing naturally in eastern North America, East Asia, and Central America; it has also been reported in southern France. ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' grows on the ground in both [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests, where it forms [[mycorrhiza]]l associations with a broad range of trees. It is an [[edible mushroom]], and is sold in rural markets in China, [[Guatemala]], and Mexico.

==Taxonomy==
Originally described in 1822 as ''Agaricus indigo'' by American mycologist [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]],<ref name=Schweinitz1822/> the species was later transferred to the genus ''Lactarius'' in 1838 by the Swede [[Elias Magnus Fries]].<ref name=Fries1836/> German botanist [[Otto Kuntze]] called it ''Lactifluus indigo'' in his 1891 treatise ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]'',<ref name=Kuntze1891/> but the suggested name change was not adopted by others. [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler|Hesler]] and [[Alexander Hanchett Smith|Smith]], in their 1960 study of North American species of ''Lactarius'', defined ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' as the [[type species]] of subsection ''Caerulei'', a group characterized by blue latex and a sticky, blue cap.<ref name=Hesler1960/> In 1979, they revised their opinions on the organization of subdivisions in the genus ''Lactarius'', and instead placed ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' in [[subgenus]] ''Lactarius'' based on the color of latex and the subsequent color changes observed after exposure to air.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 66.</ref> As they explained:<blockquote>The gradual development of blue to violet pigmentation as one progresses from species to species is an interesting phenomenon deserving further study. The climax is reached in ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' which is blue throughout. ''L.&nbsp;chelidonium'' and its variety ''chelidonioides'', ''L.&nbsp;paradoxus'', and ''L. hemicyaneus'' may be considered as mileposts along the road to ''L.&nbsp;indigo''.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 7.</ref></blockquote>
The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''indigo'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word meaning "indigo blue".<ref name=Roody2003/> Its names in the English [[common name|vernacular]] include the "indigo milk cap",<ref name=Arora69/> the "indigo Lactarius",<ref name=Roody2003/> the "blue milk mushroom",<ref name=Russell2006/> and the "blue Lactarius".<ref name=Fergus2003/> In central Mexico, it is known as ''añil'', ''azul'', ''hongo azul'', ''zuin'', and ''zuine''; it is also called ''quexque'' (meaning "blue") in [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]].<ref name=Montoya1996/>

==Description==
Like many other mushrooms, ''L. indigo'' develops from a nodule that forms within the underground [[mycelium]], a mass of threadlike fungal cells called [[hypha]]e that make up the bulk of the organism. Under appropriate environmental conditions of temperature, humidity, and nutrient availability, the visible reproductive structures ([[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]]) are formed. The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of the fruit body, measuring between {{convert|4|–|15|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter, is initially convex and later develops a central depression; in age it becomes even more deeply depressed, becoming somewhat funnel-shaped as the edge of the cap lifts upward.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 27.</ref><ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=176}}</ref> The margin of the cap is rolled inwards when young, but unrolls and elevates as it matures. The cap surface is indigo blue when fresh, but fades to a paler grayish- or silvery-blue, sometimes with greenish splotches. It is often [[wikt:zonate|zonate]]: marked with concentric lines that form alternating pale and darker zones, and the cap may have dark blue spots, especially towards the edge. Young caps are sticky to the touch.<ref name=Bessette1992/>{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=left|image1=Lactarius indigo 54015.jpg|image2=Lactarius indigo 48609.jpg|width=160|caption1=Overhead view of caps found in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico|caption2=The cap margin is rolled inwards in young specimens.|alt1=Four light-blue colored mushroom caps growing in the ground, surrounded by dead leaves and twigs.|alt2=The underside of a circular, blue mushroom cap lying in the dirt. The edges of the cap are a much lighter blue than the gills that radiate out from the central stem, and are rolled inward, partially covering the gills.}}The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is pallid to bluish in color, slowly turning greenish after being exposed to air; its taste is mild to slightly acrid. The flesh of the entire mushroom is brittle, and the stem, if bent sufficiently, will snap open cleanly.<ref name=Arora1991/> The latex exuded from injured tissue is [[indigo]] blue, and stains the wounded tissue greenish; like the flesh, the latex has a mild taste.<ref name=Roody2003/> ''Lactarius indigo'' is noted for not producing as much latex as other ''Lactarius'' species,<ref name="urlFoTM"/> and older specimens in particular may be too dried out to produce any latex.<ref name=Metzler1992/>

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] of the mushroom range from [[wikt:adnate|adnate]] (squarely attached to the stem) to slightly [[wikt:decurrent|decurrent]] (running down the length of the stem), and crowded close together. Their color is an indigo blue, becoming paler with age or staining green with damage. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|2|–|8|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} tall by {{convert|1|–|2.5|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick, and the same diameter throughout or sometimes narrowed at base.<ref name="audu" /> Its color is indigo blue to silvery- or grayish blue. The interior of the stem is solid and firm initially, but develops a hollow with age.<ref name=Arora69/> Like the cap, it is initially sticky or slimy to the touch when young, but soon dries out.<ref name=MushroomExpert/> Its attachment to the cap is usually in a central position, although it may also be off-center.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], pp. 68–9.</ref> Fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' have no distinguishable odor.<ref name=Miller2006/>

''L. indigo'' var. ''diminutivus'' (the "smaller indigo milk cap") is a smaller variant of the mushroom, with a cap diameter between {{convert|3|–|7|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}}, and a stem {{convert|1.5|–|4|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} long and {{convert|0.3|–|1|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick.<ref name=Bessette2007/> It is often seen in [[Virginia]].<ref name=Miller2006/> Hesler and Smith, who first described the variant based on specimens found in [[Brazoria County, Texas]], described its typical habitat as "along [the] sides of a muddy ditch under grasses and weeds, [with] [[loblolly pine]] nearby".<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 70.</ref>

===Microscopic features===
When viewed in mass, as in a [[spore print]], the [[basidiospore|spores]] appear cream to yellow colored.<ref name=Roody2003/><ref name=Arora69>[[#Arora|Arora (1986)]], p. 69.</ref> Viewed with a [[light microscope]], the spores are translucent ([[hyaline]]), elliptical to nearly spherical in shape, with [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] warts, and have dimensions of 7–9 by 5.5–7.5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name=Roody2003/> [[Scanning electron microscopy]] reveals [[wikt:reticulation|reticulations]] on the spore surface.<ref name=Montoya1996/> The [[hymenium]] is the spore-producing tissue layer of the fruit body, and consists of [[hypha]]e that extend into the gills and terminate as end cells. Various cell types can be observed in the hymenium, and the cells have microscopic characteristics that may be used to help identify or distinguish species in cases where the macroscopic characters may be ambiguous. The spore-bearing cells, the [[basidia]], are four-spored and measure 37–45&nbsp;μm long by 8–10&nbsp;μm wide at the thickest point.<ref>[[#Hesler|Hesler and Smith (1979)]], p. 68.</ref> [[Cystidia]] are terminal cells of hyphae in the hymenium which do not produce spores, and function in aiding spore dispersal, and maintaining favorable humidity around developing spores.<ref name=Watling1977/> The [[wikt:pleurocystidium|pleurocystidia]] are cystidia that are found on the face of a gill; they are 40–56 by 6.4–8&nbsp;μm, roughly spindle-shaped, and have a constricted apex. The [[wikt:cheilocystidium|cheilocystidia]]—located on the edge of a gill—are abundant, and are 40.0–45.6 by 5.6–7.2&nbsp;μm.<ref name=Montoya1996/>


=== Chemical composition ===
 pigment from ''L. indigo''. The part of the molecule responsible for its color ([[chromophore]]) is highlighted in blue.|alt=(7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate structure]]
A [[Analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]] of Mexican specimens has shown ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' to contain [[water content|moisture]] at 951&nbsp;mg/g of mushroom, fat at 4.3&nbsp;mg/g, protein at 13.4&nbsp;mg/g, and [[dietary fiber]] at 18.7&nbsp;mg/g, much higher in comparison to the common [[Agaricus bisporus|button mushroom]], which contains 6.6&nbsp;mg/g. Compared to three other wild edible mushroom species also tested in the study (''[[Amanita rubescens]]'', ''[[Boletus frostii]]'', and ''[[Ramaria flava]]''), ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' contained the highest [[saturated fatty acid]]s content, including [[stearic acid]] with 32.1&nbsp;mg/g—slightly over half of the total [[free fatty acid]] content.<ref name="LeonGuzman1997" />

The blue color of ''L. indigo'' is due to (7-isopropenyl-4-methylazulen-1-yl)methyl stearate, an [[organic compound|organic]] [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of [[azulene]], which is biosynthesised from a [[sesquiterpene]] very similar to [[matricin]], the precursor for [[chamazulene]]. It is unique to this species, but similar to a compound found in ''[[Lactarius deliciosus|L.&nbsp;deliciosus]]''.<ref name="Harmon1979" />

=== Similar species ===
The characteristic blue color of the fruiting body and the latex make this species easily recognizable. Other ''Lactarius'' species with some blue color include the "silver-blue milky" (''[[Lactarius paradoxus|L.&nbsp;paradoxus]]''), found in eastern North America,<ref name=Miller2006/> which has a grayish-blue cap when young, but it has reddish-brown to purple-brown latex and gills. ''[[Lactarius chelidonium|L.&nbsp;chelidonium]]'' has a yellowish to dingy yellow-brown to bluish-gray cap and yellowish to brown latex. ''[[Lactarius quieticolor|L.&nbsp;quieticolor]]'' has blue-colored flesh in the cap and orange to red-orange flesh in the base of the stem.<ref name=Arora69/> Although the blue discoloration of ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' is thought to be rare in the genus ''Lactarius'', in 2007 five new species were reported from [[Peninsular Malaysia]] with bluing latex or flesh, including ''[[Lactarius cyanescens|L.&nbsp;cyanescens]]'', ''[[Lactarius lazulinus|L.&nbsp;lazulinus]]'', ''[[Lactarius mirabilis|L.&nbsp;mirabilis]]'', and two species still unnamed.<ref name=Stubbe2007/>

==Distribution, habitat, and ecology==
''Lactarius indigo'' is [[range (biology)|distributed]] throughout southern and eastern North America but is most common along the [[Gulf Coast]], Mexico, and [[Macrofungi of Guatemala|Guatemala]]. Its frequency of appearance in the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the United States has been described as "occasional to locally common".<ref name=Roody2003/> Mycologist [[David Arora]] notes that in the United States, the species is found with [[ponderosa pine]] in [[Arizona]], but is absent in [[California]]'s ponderosa pine forests.<ref>[[#Arora|Arora (1986)]], p. 35.</ref> It has also been collected from China,<ref name=Wang2000/> India,<ref name=Sharma2002/><ref name=Upadhyay2004/> Guatemala,<ref name=Morales2002/> Costa Rica (in forests dominated by oak),<ref name=Mueller2006/> and as its southernmost distribution in the [[Quercus humboldtii|Humboldt oak]] cloud forests of Colombia.<ref name=Winkler2013/> In Europe, it has so far only been found in southern France.<ref name=Marcel1988/> A study on the seasonal appearance of fruiting bodies in the [[subtropical]] forests of [[Xalapa]], Mexico, confirmed that maximal production coincided with the [[Wet season|rainy season]] between June and September.<ref name=Chacon1995/>

''L. indigo'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, and as such, establishes a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the roots of certain trees ("hosts"), in which the fungi exchange [[mineral]]s and [[amino acids]] extracted from the soil for [[Carbon fixation|fixed carbon]] from the host. The subterranean [[hyphae]] of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the [[wikt:rootlet|rootlets]] of a broad range of tree species, forming so-called ectomycorrhizae—an intimate association that is especially beneficial to the host, as the fungus produces [[enzyme]]s that [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralize]] organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree.<ref name=Nasholm1998/>

Reflecting their close relationships with trees, the fruit bodies of ''L. indigo'' are typically found growing on the ground, scattered or in groups, in both [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests.<ref name= Healy2008/> They are also commonly found in [[floodplain]] areas that have been recently submerged.<ref name=Metzler1992/> In Mexico, associations have been noted with [[Alnus jorullensis|Mexican alder]], [[Carpinus caroliniana|American Hornbeam]], [[Ostrya virginiana|American Hophornbeam]], and ''[[Liquidambar]] macrophylla'',<ref name=Montoya1996/> while in Guatemala the mushroom associates with [[Pinus pseudostrobus|smooth-bark Mexican pine]] and other [[pine]] and [[oak]] species.<ref name=Morales2002/> In [[Costa Rica]], the species forms associations with several native oaks of the genus ''[[Quercus]]''.<ref name="urlHalling"/> Under controlled laboratory conditions, ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' was shown to be able to form ectomycorrhizal associations with the [[neotropical]] pine species [[Pinus ayacahuite|Mexican white pine]], [[Pinus hartwegii|Hartweg's pine]], [[Pinus oocarpa|Mexican yellow pine]], smooth-bark Mexican pine,<ref name=Flores2005/> and  the [[Eurasia]]n pines [[Pinus halepensis|Aleppo pine]], [[Pinus nigra|European black pine]], [[maritime pine]], and [[Scots pine]].<ref name=Diaz2007/>

== Uses ==
Although ''L. indigo'' is a well-known edible species, opinions vary on its desirability. For example, American mycologist [[David Arora]] considers it a "superior edible",<ref name="Arora69" /> while a [[field guide]] on [[Kansas]] fungi rates it as "mediocre in quality".<ref name="Abel1993" /> It may have a slightly bitter,<ref name="Hall2003" /> or peppery taste,<ref name="McKnight1987" /> and has a coarse, grainy texture.<ref name="Roody2003" /><ref name="Abel1993" /> The firm flesh is best prepared by cutting the mushroom in thin slices. The blue color disappears with cooking, and the mushroom becomes grayish. Because of the granular texture of the flesh, it does not lend itself well to drying. Specimens producing copious quantities of milk may be used to add color to [[marinade]]s.<ref name="Sicard2005" />

In Mexico, individuals harvest the wild mushrooms for sale at farmers' markets, typically from June to November;<ref name="Montoya1996" /> they are considered a "second class" species for consumption.<ref name="Bandala1997" /> ''L.&nbsp;indigo'' is also sold in [[Guatemalan cuisine|Guatemalan]] markets from May to October.<ref name="Flores2005" /> In [[Honduras]], the mushroom is called a chora, and is generally eaten with egg; generally as a side dish for a bigger meal.{{Citation needed|date=July 2024}} It is one of 13 ''Lactarius'' species sold at rural markets in [[Yunnan]] in southwestern China.<ref name="Wang2000" />
