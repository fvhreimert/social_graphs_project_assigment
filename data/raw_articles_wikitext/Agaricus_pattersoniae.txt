'''''Agaricus pattersoniae''''' is an [[edible mushroom|edible]] species of mushroom. It is found in the United States, where it associates with [[Cupressus macrocarpa|cypress]] trees. It has been proposed for inclusion in the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].

==Taxonomy==
It was first [[species description|described]] in the literature in 1907 by [[Charles Horton Peck]], based on specimens found by {{nowrap|A.M. Patterson}}, a botany student at [[Stanford University]]. She found fruit bodies on Stanford campus in January, where they were growing under [[pine]] and cypress trees.<ref name="Peck 1907"/> The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] was originally spelled "Pattersonae" by Peck, although this is now considered an [[orthographic variant]].<ref name="urlMyoBank: Agaricus pattersonae"/> This species was placed in [[section (botany)|section]] ''Sanguinolenti'' of genus ''[[Agaricus]]''<ref name="Kerrigan 1979"/> but in the related section ''Nigrobrunnescentes'' when this is considered separate.<ref name = HeEtAl2018>{{cite journal |title=A new section and species of Agaricus subgenus Pseudochitonia from Thailand |first1=Mao-Qiang |last1=He |first2=Boontiya |last2=Chuankid |first3=Kevin D. |last3=Hyde |first4=Ratchadawan |last4=Cheewangkoon |first5=Rui-Lin |last5=Zhao |journal=[[MycoKeys]] |year=2018 |issue=40 |pages=53–67 |url=https://mycokeys.pensoft.net/article/26918/list/8/|doi=10.3897/mycokeys.40.26918 |pmid=30271264 |pmc=6160818 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], {{convert|5|–|19|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, is initially almost hemispherical in shape, transforming to broadly convex and finally to flattened or with edges upturned in age. The cap surface is dry, with [[wikt:fibril|fibrils]] when young, but later the fibrils form large, dark brown [[wikt:appressed|appressed]] [[wikt: squamules|squamules]] (2–9&nbsp;mm long by 2–5&nbsp;mm broad). The cap color may be various shades of brown depending on the maturity of the specimen. The cap [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is typically {{convert|1|–|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, firm, white, and stains deep red 20–30 seconds after injury or bruising. The odor immediately after cutting is mild, faintly spicy, but several minutes may be described as 'fruity'. An [[edible mushroom]], the taste of ''A.&nbsp;pattersoniae'' is described as mild, pleasant, and slightly sweet.<ref name="Kerrigan 1979"/>

The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free in attachment, closely spaced, {{convert|5|–|15|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} broad, and [[wikt: marginate|marginate]]. The light-cinnamon color in young specimens turns to a dark blackish brown in age after the spores develop. Bruised gills stain a [[wine (color)|vinaceous]] (wine-colored) red.<ref name="Kerrigan 1979"/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is usually {{convert|8|–|18|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2.5|–|4|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick with a bulbous shape. The interior is hollow, with the internal cavity being between {{convert|5|and|9|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick. The stipe [[Trama (mycology)|context]] somewhat fibrous and white in color, except for the basal section which is yellowish. Bruising or cutting results in a red stain after a minute. The surface of the stipe is barely striate above the [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]], and smooth below except for fragments of the [[universal veil]]. During development the veils rupture and form an upper veil ([[partial veil]]), which initially hangs from the edge of the cap, and a lower veil. As the partial veil disintegrates, it often leaves fragments 2–3&nbsp;mm in size attached to the margin.<ref name="Kerrigan 1979"/>

The [[spores]] are roughly elliptical in shape, 7–8.5 by 5.5–6.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The [[basidia]], which may be 1–, 2–, 3–, or 4–spored (although usually 4–spored during active sporulation), are 26–34 by 7–11&nbsp;μm,  cylinder- to club-shaped, with [[sterigma]]ta that are 2–3&nbsp;μm long. Cheilocystidia are 12–32 by 6–15&nbsp;μm in size, almost cylindrical or club-shaped, and may appear clumped or continuous.<ref name="Kerrigan 1979"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Agaricus pattersoniae'' is associated with cypress (''[[Cupressus macrocarpa]]'') trees, where it fruits singly or in groups. Richard Kerrigan noted that it seems to be restricted to mature trees (age 40+ years) located in the coastal counties of [[California]],<ref name="Kerrigan 1979"/> although [[Alexander H. Smith]] mentions that it has also been found in the [[Great Lakes]] regions.<ref name="Smith 1980"/> The species has been proposed for inclusion in the [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] as part of the Global Fungal Red List initiative. Its main threats include [[habitat destruction]], [[2012–2013 North American drought#California|drought]], and decline of cypress trees due to cypress [[canker]] from infection by ''[[Seiridium cardinale]]''. The cypress trees have been removed from the type locality.<ref name="urlGRFL"/>
