==Etymology==
The fungus was originally described as ''Phallus crispus'' by the naturalist [[Giovanni Antonio Scopoli]] in 1772.<ref>{{cite book |title=Flora carniolica |author=Scopoli JA. |year=1772 |volume=2 |edition=2 |page=475 |language=it}}</ref> Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is [[Latin]] adjective ''crispa'' 'wrinkled' or 'curly'. The generic name was originally a type of Italian herb but became associated with morels.<ref name="Nilper77">Nilsson S, Persson O.(1977) ''Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill Fungi)''. pp. 36-37.

== Description ==
''Helvella crispa'' is creamy white in colour, {{convert|6–13|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}} in length, with a [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] 2–6&nbsp;cm (1–2&nbsp;in) in diameter.<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |pages=106}}</ref> It is striking due to its irregularly shaped lobes on the cap, but with a robust creamy-white base (2–8×1–2.5&nbsp;cm in size). Its [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thin and brittle. The stem is 3–10&nbsp;cm (1¼–4&nbsp;in) long, white or pinkish in colour and ornately ribbed. It gives off a pleasant aroma, but is not edible raw.

The [[spore print]] is white and the oval [[spore]]s average 19 x 11.5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Phillips06">{{cite book | author = Phillips R | year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms| publisher = Pan Macmillan Ltd|location=London| isbn=0-330-44237-6 |page=360}}</ref> Occasionally white-capped forms are found. It can be distinguished from occasional white forms of ''[[Helvella lacunosa]]'' by its furry cap undersurface and inrolled margins when young.<ref name="Ammir85" />

==Distribution and habitat==
''H. crispa'' is found in China,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Zhuang WY. |year=2004|title=Preliminary survey of the Helvellaceae from Xinjiang, China |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=35–42}}</ref> Japan,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Nagao H.|year=2002 |title=Fungal flora in Chiba Pref., central Japan (III) Ascomycetes: Plectomycetes and Discomycetes |journal=Journal of the Natural History Museum and Institute Chiba |volume=5 |pages=111–132 |url=https://www.chiba-muse.or.jp/NATURAL/files/1521439185860/simple/journal_9-1_1hukiharu.pdf }}</ref> Europe and eastern and western<ref name=":0" /> North America, though is sometimes replaced by the related ''[[Helvella lacunosa]]'' in western parts.<ref name="arora86">{{cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/816/mode/2up |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |location=Berkeley, California |year=1986 |orig-date=1979 |edition=2nd |pages=816}}</ref>

It grows in grass as well as in humid hardwoods, such as [[beech]] (not so well in resinous ones), along the side of pathways, in hedges and on the talus of meadows. They can be spotted from the end of summer until the end of autumn.<ref name=Haas69>{{cite book | last = Haas |first=Hans | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi| publisher = Burke | isbn= 0-222-79409-7 |page=184}}</ref>

==Edibility==
{{See also|Gyromitra esculenta}}

Some guidebooks list this species as [[edible mushroom|edible]] as recently as 2006.<ref name = "Phillips06"/><ref name=Haas69/>. However, it has been reported to cause gastrointestinal symptoms when eaten raw.<ref name=Ammir85>{{cite book |last1=Ammirati |first1=Joseph F.|last2=Traquair |first2=James A. |last3=Horgen |first3=Paul A. |title=Poisonous mushrooms of the northern United States and Canada |url=https://archive.org/details/poisonousmushroo00amma |url-access=limited |year=1985 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=0-8166-1407-5 |page=[https://archive.org/details/poisonousmushroo00amma/page/n273 259]}}</ref> Many sources list this species as containing or being suspected of containing [[monomethylhydrazine]]; extensive chemical analysis has not been performed on this species. Some guides recommend that if consumed, it is recommended to cook thoroughly and only in small amounts, and to consume with caution.<ref name="tfb" /> There is no evidence of this species being widely consumed, or that toxins are removed during cooking.

Recent evidence suggests that this fungus and similar species containing [[gyromitrin]] may cause the  fatal disease [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) after many years or even decades.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Frei |first1=Martina |title=Mysteriöse Erkrankungsfälle in einem kleinen Alpendorf |trans-title=Mysterious disease cases in a small Alpine village |url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/mysterioese-erkrankungsfaelle-in-einem-kleinen-alpendorf-541196029898 |work=Tages-Anzeiger |date=5 December 2022 |language=de }}</ref><ref>{{cite conference |last1=Lagrange |first1=E |last2=Bonneterre |first2=Vincent |last3=Talbot |first3=K |last4=Couratier |first4=Philippe |last5=Bernard |first5=E |last6=Camu |first6=William |title=A high-incidence cluster of ALS in the French Alps: common environment and multiple exposures |date=December 2017 |url=https://hal.science/hal-01658408/ |conference=28th international symposium on ALS/MND |volume=18 |issue=Supplément S2 |page=179 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spencer |first1=Peter S. |last2=Palmer |first2=Valerie S. |last3=Kisby |first3=Glen E. |last4=Lagrange |first4=Emmeline |last5=Horowitz |first5=B.
