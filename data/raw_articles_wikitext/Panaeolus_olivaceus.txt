'''''Panaeolus olivaceus''''' is a widely distributed, rarely identified, little brown mushroom that contains the hallucinogen [[psilocybin]]. It is often mistaken for ''[[Panaeolus foenisecii]]'' and is distinguished by its black [[spore print]] and darker [[lamella (mycology)|gill]] coloration when mature alongside a slightly thicker [[stipe (mycology)|stem]]. It is even more easily mistaken for ''[[Panaeolus cinctulus]]'' or ''[[Panaeolus fimicola]]'' and can be distinguished from them both by its slightly roughened spores. It is also easily confused with ''[[Panaeolina castaneifolia]]'', a species which has [[spore]]s that are dark brown and significantly more roughened.

== Description ==
*'''Cap''': 1 — 4 cm across, Distinctly campanulate then subhemispheric to convex, becoming broadly conic, not fully expanding, incurved margin when young, dark smoky-grayish to dark cinnamon, drying to a straw-yellow or slightly olive-gray color, remaining more reddish-brown towards the center, hygrophanous, smooth, sometimes striated or finely corrugated, flesh thick and firm.
*'''Gills''': Adnate to adnexed, close, thin, pallid, mottled, slightly olive-greenish, becoming dark purplish gray-black in age, edge whitish.
*'''Stipe''': 4 — 7.5 cm by 3 — 6 mm thick, equal to slightly tapering at the base, hollow, brittle, [[wikt:pruinose|pruinose]] and slightly striate, no veil remnants. Grayish to ochraceous, tan or purple at the base.
*'''Spores''': Black, slightly roughened, 12 — 17 x 7 — 10 micrometers, elliptic, rugose or verrucose.
*'''Microscopic features''': Basidia 24 — 28 x 10 - 12 micrometers. Cheilocystidia 20 — 38 x 5 — 10 micrometers, abundant, neck often flexuous and apices usually obtuse, thin walled and hyaline, pleurocystidia rare or absent, not projecting beyond plane of basidia.

==Habitat and formation==
''Panaeolus olivaceus'' grows scattered to gregariously in rich grassy areas, from late summer through December, across North and South America, likely more widely distributed; it has been collected in the U.S. states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Florida (U.S. state)|Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[South Carolina (U.S. state)|South Carolina]], [[Minnesota (U.S. state)|Minnesota]], [[Canada]]'s [[Quebec]], [[New Zealand]] and in the [[United Kingdom]].
