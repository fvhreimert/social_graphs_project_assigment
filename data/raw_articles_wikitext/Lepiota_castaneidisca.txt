'''''Lepiota castaneidisca''''' is a species of [[agaric]] fungus in the family [[Agaricaceae]]. Formally described in 1912, it was for a long time considered the same species as the similar ''[[Lepiota cristata]]'' until [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis reported in 2001 demonstrated that it was genetically distinct. It is most common in coastal and northern [[California]], and has also been recorded in Mexico. A [[saprobic]] species, it is usually found under [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] and [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]]. Its [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] ([[mushroom]]s) have white [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] with an orange-red to orange-brown center that measure up to {{convert|3.2|cm|in|abbr=on}} wide. The cream-colored to light pink [[stipe (mycology)|stems]] are up to {{convert|6.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|0.2|–|0.6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, and have a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'' can be distinguished from other similar ''[[Lepiota]]'' species by differences in habitat, macroscopic, or microscopic characteristics.

==Systematics==
The species was first [[species description|described]] as new to science by mycologist [[William Alphonso Murrill]] in 1912. Murrill collected the [[type (biology)|type]] material growing near redwoods near [[Searsville Lake]], [[California]], in December 1911.<ref name="Murrill 1912"/> In 1914,<ref name="Murrill 1914"/> Murrill decided that the species was the same as ''[[Lepiota cristata]]'' (which he called ''Lepiota conspurcata'' (Willd.) Morgan); this opinion was later corroborated by Walter Sundberg in 1989 after he studied the type collection and concluded that the microscopic characteristics of both were the same.<ref name="Sundberg 1989"/> Using [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis based on comparing [[DNA sequence]]s of the [[internal transcribed spacer]] region, mycologist Else Vellinga determined that despite the lack of distinguishing [[morphology (biology)|micro-morphological]] characteristics, the two species were distinct.<ref name="Vellinga 2001"/>

The [[specific name (botany)|epithet]] ''castaneidisca'' refers to the chestnut-colored center of the cap. ''Lepiota'' means "the scaly one".<ref name="Vellinga 2007"/>

==Description==


The [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''Lepiota castaneidisca'' have white, bell-shaped to convex [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s {{convert|0.8|to|3.2|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} in diameter, with an orange-reddish to pale orange-brown center. Mature specimens fade and lose the reddish shades. The cap surface develops small pale pink or cream patches (especially on the outermost zone) on a white background that has radially arranged [[wikt:fibril|fibrils]].<ref name="Vellinga 2001"/> The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are somewhat crowded to moderately distant,<ref name="Vellinga 2007"/> with typically 40–45 full length gills, and 1–5 tiers of interspersed lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). They are slightly [[ventricose]], measuring 2.5–5&nbsp;mm wide, and have a white fringed or irregular edge.<ref name="Vellinga 2001"/> Whitish when young and cream-colored in age, they have a free gill attachment to the stem.  The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|25|–|65|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2|–|6|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} thick, cylindrical, slightly widened at the base, hollow, and [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]]. Its color is pinkish in the lower part, and it stains reddish where damaged, especially in older specimens.<ref name="Vellinga 2007"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, sometimes with cream tones, or reddish-brown in mature specimens.<ref name="Vellinga 2001"/> There is a [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] that points upward in young specimens, but in maturity it degrades to remnants that are left behind on the stem. It has a sharp odor similar to [[rubber]] or [[cod liver oil]].<ref name="Vellinga 2007"/>  The mushroom is not known to be [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], but consumption is not recommended due to the risk of possible confusion with ''[[Lepiota]]'' species that contain deadly [[amatoxin]]s.<ref name="MykoWeb"/>

The smooth, [[dextrinoid]] [[spore]]s are in side view triangular with a spurred base, in frontal view oblong, and typically measure 5–9 by 3–4&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name="Vellinga 2001"/> [[Staining]] with [[Brilliant cresyl blue|Cresyl blue]] shows them to be somewhat [[Metachromasy|metachromatic]], and [[Cell nucleus|binucleate]].<ref name="Vellinga 2010"/> [[Cystidia]] on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are club-shaped to cylindric or sometimes spheropedunculate (somewhat spherical with a stem), and have dimensions of 20–44 by 6.5–13.5&nbsp;μm. [[Basidia]] are 18–30 by 5–8&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], mostly four-spored, and are absent on the gill edge. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are absent. The [[cap cuticle]] is a hymeniderm (lengthened cells arranged side by side) with mostly colorless elements of different lengths, measuring 16–62 by 8–18&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Vellinga 2007"/> The stipitipellis (outer covering of the stem) comprises a layer of colorless [[hypha]]e measuring about 2–3&nbsp;μm wide. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of all parts of the fungus.<ref name="Vellinga 2001"/>

===Similar species===

''Lepiota castaneidisca'' closely resembles ''L.&nbsp;cristata'' (with which it has commonly been confused),<ref name="MykoWeb"/> but it has a more rounded cap, lacks an [[umbo (mycology)|umbo]], and is reddish- or pinkish-brown, rather than orange-brown.<ref name="Vellinga 2001"/> ''L.&nbsp;cristata'', which is widely distributed in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], prefers habitats where the natural vegetational cover has been disturbed by humans, or in the beds of rivers and creeks; in contrast, ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'' is found in natural, undisturbed habitats.<ref name="Vellinga 2007"/> Other similar species in similar habitats with which ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'' could be confused include ''[[Lepiota thiersii|L.&nbsp;thiersii]]'' and ''[[Lepiota neophana|L.&nbsp;neophana]]''; in contrast to ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'', both of the latter two species have ellipsoid spores.<ref name="Vellinga 2001"/> The fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;thiersii'' appear from November through April, and grow scattered or in groups under [[Cupressus macrocarpa|cypress]]. It usually lacks the reddish color in the center of the cap associated with ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'', and its spores are not as long, with dimensions of 4.7–6.3 by 3.1–3.9&nbsp;μm. ''L.&nbsp;neophana'' is a rare species, but more widely distributed in the United States than ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'', as it has been reported from [[Ohio]] and [[Michigan]] in addition to California. It also fruits under cypress, usually between December and April. This mushroom is most readily distinguished from ''L.&nbsp;castaneidisca'' by the dark brown to blackish-brown color of the cap center.<ref name="Sundberg 1989"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Lepiota castaneidisca'' is a [[saprobic]] fungus.<ref name="Vellinga 2001"/> Fruit bodies appear in the late fall and winter (November to February), where they grow gregariously near cypress, [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] or in mixed  [[Quercus agrifolia|coast live oak]] forests. The fungus is common in coastal and northern [[California]], and is often found in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref name="Vellinga 2007"/> The northern limit of its distribution is [[Washington (state)|Washington state]]<ref name="Vellinga 2010"/> and southern [[British Columbia]], and it has been recorded as far south as Mexico.<ref name="Aroche 1984"/>
