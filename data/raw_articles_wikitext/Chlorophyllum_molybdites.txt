The species is [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] and causes potentially serious [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]]. It is the most commonly consumed poisonous mushroom in North America, often being misidentified as edible species like ''[[Chlorophyllum rhacodes]]'' (the shaggy parasol) and ''[[Macrolepiota procera]]'' (parasol mushroom).

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|pileus]] (cap) ranges from {{Convert|8 to 30|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in diameter, hemispherical and with a flattened top. The cap is whitish in colour with coarse brownish scales. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are free and white, usually turning dark and green with maturity. It is the only large mushroom that has a green [[spore print]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

== Toxicity ==
''Chlorophyllum molybdites'' is the most frequently eaten [[poisonous mushroom]] in North America.<ref name="poisonoverview">Beug, Michael W. [http://www.cmsweb.org/articles/poisonings_in_NA.htm An Overview of Mushroom Poisonings in North America.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520190319/http://www.cmsweb.org/articles/poisonings_in_NA.htm|date=2010-05-20}} ''The Mycophile'', vol. 45(2):4-5, March/April 2004</ref> The symptoms, likely caused by the chemical compound molybdophyllysin, are predominantly gastrointestinal in nature, with vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pains, often severe, occurring 1–3 hours after consumption.<ref name="benjamin95"/> Although these poisonings can be severe, particularly in children,<ref name=":0" /> deaths from these mushrooms have been incredibly rare (and have mainly occurred in small children and dogs).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.poisonsinfo.health.qld.gov.au/plants-and-mushrooms/green-spored-parasol-chlorophyllum-molybdites}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.ifas.ufl.edu/news/2013/05/02/florida-expert-keep-pets-livestock-away-from-false-parasol-mushrooms/}}</ref>Professor James Kimbrough writes:<blockquote>''Chlorophyllum molybdites'', the green-spored Morgan's Lepiota, is responsible for the greatest number of cases of mushroom poisonings in North America, and in Florida. This is probably due to the fact that it is easily confused with choice edible species such as ''[[Lepiota procera]]'' and ''[[Shaggy parasol|L.&nbsp;rhacodes]]'', and it is one of the most common mushrooms found on lawns and pastures throughout the country, with the exception of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. When eaten raw ''C.&nbsp;molybdites'' produce [[Gastrointestinal disease|severe symptoms]], including bloody stools, within a couple of hours. When cooked well, or parboiled and decanting the liquid before cooking, others eat and enjoy it. Eilers and Nelso (1974) found a heat-labile, high molecular weight protein which showed an adverse effect when given by intraperitoneal injection into laboratory animals.<ref>''Common Florida Mushrooms'', p. 325.</ref></blockquote>

Cases of poisoning from these mushrooms are also reported in [[Malaysia]], where they are often mistaken for ''[[Termitomyces]]'' mushrooms that are found locally.<ref name="ARN">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.asiaresearchnews.com/html/article.php/aid/12290/cid/2/research/medicine/university_of_malaya/preventing_fatal_harvest_of_mushrooms.html |title=Preventing fatal harvest of mushrooms |author=Phan Chia Wei<!-- exct nm --> |date=17 December 2018 |magazine=Asia Research News |access-date=14 July 2023 }}</ref> It also might be confused for ''[[Coprinus comatus]]'' (shaggy mane).
