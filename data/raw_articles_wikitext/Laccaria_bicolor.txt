'''''Laccaria bicolor''''' is a small tan-colored [[mushroom]] with lilac [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]] but not choice,<ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=Roger |title=Mushrooms and Other Fungi of North America |year=2010 |publisher=Firefly Books |location=Buffalo, NY |isbn=978-1-55407-651-2 |page=69}}</ref> and grows in mixed [[birch]] and [[pine]] woods. It is found in the [[temperate zones]] of the globe, in late summer and autumn.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book |author=Roger Phillips |year=2006 |title=Mushrooms |publisher=Pan MacMillan |isbn=978-0-330-44237-4}}</ref> ''L.&nbsp;bicolor'' is an [[ectomycorrhiza]]l fungus used as a [[soil inoculant]] in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]].

==Taxonomy==
It was initially [[species description|described]] as a [[subspecies]] of ''[[Laccaria laccata]]'' by French [[mycologist]] [[René Maire]] in 1937, before being raised to species rank by [[P.D. Orton]] in 1960.<ref name="Orton 1960"/> Like others in its genus it has the common name of 'Deceiver', because of its propensity to fade and become hard to identify.<ref name="Money 2011">{{cite book |author=Money NP. |title=Mushroom |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OinOUZQmcdQC&pg=PA73 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-973256-2 |page=73}}</ref>

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|2|–|4.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} across, convex to flat, and with a central navel. It is often incurved at the margin, and is various shades of ochraceous-buff, and tan, depending on moisture content. Young specimens are quite vividly colored, but more often are found duller in appearance.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rogers Mushrooms - Laccaria bicolor |url=http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/loadimage.asp?did=9057&blockName=Laccaria%20bicolor |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218052249/http://www.rogersmushrooms.com/gallery/loadimage.asp?did=9057&blockName=Laccaria%20bicolor |archive-date=2012-02-18 |access-date=2025-10-18 |website=www.rogersmushrooms.com}}</ref> The fibrillose [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is the same color, and with a distinct lilac down towards the base. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is whitish, tinged with pink, or ochraceous, and has no apparent distinctive smell, or taste. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] are pale lilac at first, fading paler. The [[spore]]s are white.<ref name=Phillips06/>

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is [[mycorrhizal]] with a range of trees, and is found throughout the [[temperate]] zones of the world, in summer and autumn.  This includes [[temperate]] and [[boreal forest]]s of North America and probably Northern Europe.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Mueller GM, Gardes M. |year=1991 |title=Intra- and interspecific relations within ''Laccaria bicolor sensu lato'' |journal=Mycological Research |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=592–601 |doi=10.1016/s0953-7562(09)80073-7}}</ref> It seems to prefer [[birch]] and [[pine]] woods.<ref name=Phillips06/>

==Carnivory==
''Laccaria bicolor'' is one of a number of species of [[Carnivorous fungus|carnivorous fungi]], but one of the few that catches and kills [[Arthropod|arthropods]], specifically [[springtail]]s.<ref name=carnivore>{{Cite journal | last1 = Klironomos | first1 = J.
