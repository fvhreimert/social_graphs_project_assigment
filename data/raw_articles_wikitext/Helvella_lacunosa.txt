'''''Helvella lacunosa''''', known as the '''slate grey saddle''' or '''fluted black elfin saddle''' in North America, simply as the '''elfin saddle''' in Britain, is an [[ascomycete]] fungus of the family [[Helvellaceae]]. It is one of the most common species in the genus ''[[Helvella]]''.<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book | author = Thomas Laessoe | year = 1998 | title = Mushrooms (flexi bound) | publisher = Dorling Kindersley | isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref> The [[mushroom]] is readily identified by its irregularly shaped grey [[pileus (mycology)|cap]], fluted [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], and fuzzy undersurfaces. It is usually found in Eastern North America and in Europe, near [[deciduous]] and [[conifer]]ous trees in summer and autumn.

==Taxonomy==
Scottish naturalist [[John Lightfoot (biologist)|John Lightfoot]] wrote of it in his 1777 work ''Flora Scotica'', calling ''Helvella mitra'', or curled helvella.<ref name=lightfoot>{{cite book | title=Flora Scotica: or, a systematic arrangement, in the Linnaean method, of the native plants of Scotland and the Hebrides | first=John | last=Lightfoot | volume= 2 | page=1047 | location=London |publisher= B. White | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/18951435}}</ref>

The fungus was formally described by Swedish botanist [[Adam Afzelius]] in 1783.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Adam |last=Afzelius | title=Helvella lacunosa | journal =Kungl. Svenska Vetenskapsakademiens Handlingar | series= 2 | volume=4| page= 304 | year=1783|language=sv | url=https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/46983497}}</ref> Its [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] is the [[Latin]] adjective ''lacunosa'', meaning "with holes". The [[genus|generic]] name was originally a type of Italian herb but became associated with morels.<ref name="Nilper77">Nilsson S, Persson O.(1977) ''Fungi of Northern Europe 1: Larger Fungi (Excluding Gill Fungi)''. pp. 36–37.

==Description==
''Helvella lacunosa'' not uncommonly appears to be made out of wax.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|last1=Trudell|first1=Steve|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WevHvt6Tr8kC|title=Mushrooms of the Pacific Northwest|last2=Ammirati|first2=Joe|publisher=Timber Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-88192-935-5|series=Timber Press Field Guides|location=Portland, OR|pages=283|language=en}}</ref> It has an irregularly folded or wrinkled [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] which may be shades of slatey grey to black, and measure anywhere from {{convert|1 to 10|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}}, though usually between {{convert|2 and 5|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. The margin can be fused with the wrinkled, ringless [[stipe (mycology)|stem]],<ref name=":1" /> which is chambered within, measuring {{convert|3–15|cm|round=0.5|abbr=on}} high and 1–3&nbsp;cm wide.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The [[spore print]] is white, and the oval spores average (12) 15–21&nbsp;× (9) 11–14&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="arora86"/>

Occasionally, white-capped forms are found. They may be distinguished from the creamy-white coloured ''[[Helvella crispa]]'' by the latter's furry cap undersurface and inrolled margins when young.<ref name="Ammir85" /> Another similar species is ''H.&nbsp;maculata'', which has a brownish cap.<ref name=":1" />

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is common in Eastern North America and is also found in Europe,<ref name="arora86"/> [[Varsey Rhododendron Sanctuary]] in Sikkim,<ref>{{cite journal | title=Diversity and conservation of wild mushrooms in Sikkim with special reference to Barsey Rhododendron Sanctuary | vauthors = Das K | date=2010 | journal = NeBIO | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages=1–13 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264886696 }}</ref> Japan,<ref>{{cite journal |last= Nagao H.|year=2002 |title=Fungal flora in Chiba Pref., central Japan (III) Ascomycetes: Plectomycetes and Discomycetes |journal=Journal of the Natural History Museum and Institute Chiba  |volume=5 |pages=111&ndash;32|language=ja}}</ref> and China.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Zhuang WY. |year=2004|title=Preliminary survey of the Helvellaceae from Xinjiang, China |journal=Mycotaxon |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=35&ndash;42}}</ref>

It is frequent in the [[Alpine climate|alpine]], and [[temperate]] zones of both the northern and southern hemispheres.<ref name=T.Laessoe/> 
The species occurs under [[pine]], [[oak]] and [[Douglas fir]] and nearby parkland and lawns.<ref name="arora86"/> Fruiting bodies appear in late summer and autumn, though have been recorded in winter in California.<ref name="arora86"/> It often occurs on burnt ground.<ref name = "Phillips06">{{cite book | author = Phillips R | year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms |page= 360| publisher = Pan Macmillan Ltd|location=London| isbn=0-330-44237-6}}</ref>

Two similar looking species occur in Western North America; ''[[Helvella vespertina]]'' is associated with [[conifer]]s and ''[[Helvella dryophila|H.&nbsp;dryophila]]'' is associated with oak. The European ''H.&nbsp;lacunosa'' has been found in Eastern North America, but rarely in the west.<ref name="Nguyen 2013" />

==Ecology==
The species can be attacked by ''[[Hypomyces cervinigenus]]'' or ''[[Clitocybe sclerotoidea]]''.<ref name=":1" />

==Edibility==
This species is eaten and regarded highly by some after thorough cooking,<ref name="tfb">{{Cite book |last=Francis-Baker |first=Tiffany |title=Concise Foraging Guide |date=2021 |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] |isbn=978-1-4729-8474-6 |series=[[The Wildlife Trusts]] |location=London |pages=107}}</ref> though the stems are not eaten.<ref name="arora86"/> Lightfoot regarded it as edible in 1777,<ref name=lightfoot/> and several guidebooks list it as edible,<ref name = "Phillips06"/><ref name=Haas69>{{cite book | last = Haas |first=Hans | year = 1969 | title = The Young Specialist looks at Fungi |page= 184| publisher = Burke | isbn= 0-222-79409-7}}</ref> yet this genus is now regarded with suspicion due to the presence of toxic compounds in several related species.
