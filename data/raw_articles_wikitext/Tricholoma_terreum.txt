'''''Tricholoma terreum''''', commonly known as the '''grey knight''' or '''dirty tricholoma''', is a grey-capped [[mushroom]] of the large genus ''[[Tricholoma]]''. It is found in coniferous woodlands in Europe and North America, and has also been encountered under introduced pine trees in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. It is regarded as [[edible mushroom|edible]], but is toxic in extremely high quantities.

==Taxonomy==
The fungus was originally [[species description|described]] as ''Agaricus terreus'' by [[Jacob Christian Schäffer]] in 1762, and as ''Agaricus myomyces'' by mycologist [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]] in 1794. It was given its current binomial name by German [[Paul Kummer]] in 1871. It is commonly known as the grey knight<ref name=Phillips06/> from its discoloured gills.<ref name=Lamaison05/>

Almost all modern sources consider ''[[Tricholoma myomyces]]'' to be a [[synonym (biology)|synonym]] of ''T.&nbsp;terreum'',<ref name=SF1/><ref name=GBIF/><ref name=Dyntaxa/> but there are some exceptions.<ref name="Bessette 2013"/>  Bon mentions that ''T.&nbsp;myomyces'' has been defined for lowland mushrooms with white gills and a fleecy cap and Courtecuisse separates it on the same basis.<ref name=Bon/><ref name=Courtecuisse/> Moser distinguished ''T.&nbsp;myomyces'' on the basis that the gills should go yellow.<ref name=Moser/>

==Description==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is {{convert|4-7|cm|frac=4|abbr=off}} wide and evenly covered in fine grey scales. Convex with a slight [[Umbo (mycology)|umbo]], it is broadly conical in shape.<ref name="Arora1986">{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |author-link=David Arora |url=https://archive.org/details/arora-david-mushrooms-demystified-a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-fleshy-fungi-ten-speed-press-1986/page/182/mode/2up |title=Mushrooms Demystified: A Comprehensive Guide to the Fleshy Fungi |date=1986 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-170-1 |edition=2nd |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=182 |orig-date=1979}}</ref> The whitish [[Stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is {{convert|3-8|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} wide and has no ring.

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are fairly close and adnate to adnexed.<ref name="Arora1986" /> The [[spore print]] is white.
