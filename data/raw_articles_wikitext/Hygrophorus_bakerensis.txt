'''''Hygrophorus bakerensis''''', [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''Mt. Baker waxy cap''', the '''brown almond waxy cap''' or the '''tawny almond waxy cap''', is a species of [[fungus]] in the family [[Hygrophoraceae]]. It is characterized by its medium to large, relatively slender-statured [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] with an almond odor, and growth often on or near rotting [[conifer]] wood. The slimy [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is brown in the center and [[cream (color)|cream]] to white near its curved edges. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] and the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] are white, and in moist environments are often covered with droplets of a translucent liquid.

The mushroom is known only from the United States, where it is common in coniferous forests throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]]. It was initially collected in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] on [[Mount Baker]], a volcano. Although [[edible mushroom|edible]], the mushroom is not considered to be of high quality.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by American mycologists [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[Lexemuel Ray Hesler]] in a 1942 publication. The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''bakerensis'' refers to [[Mount Baker]], a volcano in the [[North Cascades]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington State]] in the United States, where the mushroom was first collected.<ref name=Smith1942/> It is [[common name|commonly]] known by various names, including the "Mt.&nbsp;Baker waxy cap",<ref name=Ammirati1987/> the "brown almond waxy cap",<ref name=Arora1986/> and the "tawny almond waxy cap".<ref name=Bessette1997/>

==Description==


Young [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] have rounded [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]s with cottony margins that are rolled inward; as the mushrooms mature the caps flatten out and the margins may lift upward. The diameter of the cap reaches between {{convert|4 and 15|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}}. The center of the cap is colored yellow-brown, [[tawny (color)|tawny]] or [[amber (color)|amber]], reducing to nearly white at the margin. The cap surface is slimy when wet, and sticky as it gets older and dries out. Beneath the slime layer are hairs that are plastered tightly to the surface, which clump together a few at a time to form many little streaks. The firm white [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] of the cap is thick—{{convert|1|cm|1|abbr=in|frac=4}} near the stem attachment—and tapers evenly to the margin. It does not change color when cut or bruised. It has a mild taste and a characteristic fragrant odor that resembles [[almond]]s,<ref name=Hesler1963/> or "crushed peach pits".<ref name=Arora1986/> The waxy [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are [[decurrent]] or [[adnation|bluntly attached]] to the stem. The gill spacing is close to subdistant—between 56–88 individual gills reach the stem, with 2–3 tiers of short lamellulae (shorter gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The gills have even edges, and are narrow but become broad in large caps (8–12&nbsp;mm), ranging in color from creamy white to pinkish-[[buff (color)|buff]].<ref name=Hesler1963/> They do not discolor when they are bruised. Young specimens often have drops of a clear liquid beaded on the gills. The gills of dried specimens darken considerably.<ref name=Smith1975/>

The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|7 to 14|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} long, {{convert|0.8 to 2.5|cm|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick at the apex, solid (i.e., not hollow), and either equal in width throughout or narrowed downward. Its color is white to pale pinkish-buff, with a dry surface. The top portion of young specimens have a cottony, fine whitish powder near the top, but this sloughs off as it matures. Like the gills, the top of the stem is often beaded with drops of translucent liquid in moist weather.<ref name=Hesler1963/>

The [[basidiospore|spores]] are [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]], smooth, and measure 7–9 by 4.5–5&nbsp;[[μm]]. They are yellowish when [[staining|stained]] with [[Melzer's reagent]]. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are four-spored, and measure 40–54 by 6–8&nbsp;μm. There are no [[cystidia]] on the gill faces or edges.<ref name=Hesler1963/> The [[pileipellis|cap cuticle]] is an ixotrichoderm—a layer of gelatinized tissue where the distal portion of the filamentous [[hypha]]e are different lengths and the hyphae themselves are arranged perpendicular to the surface; this layer of gelatinous hyphae is between 100 and 250&nbsp;μm thick. [[Clamp connection]]s are present in the hyphae of the cuticle and the gill tissue.<ref name=Hesler1963/>

''[[Hygrophorus variicolor]]'' is very similar in overall appearance, differing only in having a stem made slimy by a gelatinous [[partial veil]].<ref name=Ammirati2009/> ''[[Hygrophorus tennesseensis|H.&nbsp;tennesseensis]]'' is another lookalike species, but has a [[wikt:farinaceous|farinaceous]] odor (like raw potatoes) and a bitter taste.<ref name=McKnight1987/> ''[[Hygrophorus arbustivus|H.&nbsp;arbustivus]]'' is a European species found under [[oak]]s. The "clay waxy cap" (''[[Hygrophorus discoideus|H.&nbsp;discoideus]]'') is another lookalike European species; there is a North American equivalent ''H.&nbsp;discoideus'' var. ''californius'' found at high elevations in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].<ref name="urlHygrophorus"/> Other North American species of ''Hygrophorus'' with an odor of almonds include ''[[Hygrophorus agathosmus|H.&nbsp;agathosmus]]'' (which has a gray cap), ''[[Hygrophorus monticoloa|H.&nbsp;monticola]]'' (larger spores), and ''[[Hygrophorus vinicolor|H.&nbsp;vinicolor]]'' (which has larger spores and an unpleasant taste).<ref name="urlPNKC"/> ''[[Collybia oregonensis]]'' has a similar coloration and odor, but has [[adnexed gills|adnexed]] or notched and non-waxy gills.<ref name=Arora1986/>

==Habitat and distribution==
''Hygrophorus bakerensis'' is an [[ectomycorrhiza]]l species,<ref name=Trudell2004/> and forms a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with compatible [[host (biology)|host]] plant by forming a sheath around their root tips. In this way, the fungus gains carbon and other essential organic substances from the tree and in return helps the trees take up water, [[mineral salt]]s and metabolites. It can also fight off parasites and predators such as [[nematode]]s and soil [[pathogen]]s. Associated tree species include [[Douglas-fir]].<ref name=Barroetavena12007/> The fruit bodies of ''H.&nbsp;bakerensis'' grow scattered, clustered, or in groups on the forest floor under [[conifer]]s. They are common at elevations of {{convert|1000 to 4000|ft|abbr=on}} throughout the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of the United States and the northern [[Rocky Mountains]], and have been collected from [[California]], [[Idaho]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Oregon]].<ref name=Hesler1963/><ref name=Orr1979/> It has been found as far north as [[Hazelton, British Columbia]],<ref name=Durall1999/> east to [[Quebec]], Canada.<ref name="urlwww.mycoquebec.org"/> Fruit bodies typically appear from September to December,<ref name=Hesler1963/> and they can be very common.<ref name=Arora1986/>

==Edibility==
The mushroom is [[edible mushroom|edible]], but considered to be of low quality.<ref name=Ammirati2009/> Smith does not recommend the mushroom for consumption, noting, "I have been informed by a number of collectors that the species is edible, but many of them thought it was a ''[[Clitocybe]]'' or a ''[[Tricholoma]]''!".<ref name=Smith1975/>
