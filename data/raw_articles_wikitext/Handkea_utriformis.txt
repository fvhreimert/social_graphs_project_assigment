'''''Handkea utriformis''''', [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with ''Lycoperdon utriforme'', ''Lycoperdon caelatum'' or ''Calvatia utriformis'', is a species of the [[puffball]] family [[Lycoperdaceae]]. A rather large [[mushroom]], it may reach dimensions of up to {{convert|25|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} broad by {{convert|20|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} tall. It is [[common name|commonly known]] as the '''mosaic puffball''', a reference to the polygonal-shaped segments the outer surface of the [[fruiting body]] develops as it matures. Widespread in northern [[temperate]] zones, it is found frequently on pastures and sandy [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]s, and is [[edible mushroom|edible]] when young. ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'' has [[antibiotic]] activity against a number of bacteria, and can [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] the trace metals [[copper]] and [[zinc]] to relatively high concentrations.

==Taxonomy==
This puffball was originally described in 1790 by French botanist [[Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard]] as ''Lycoperdon utriforme'', and since then, has been variously placed in the genera ''[[Bovista]]'', ''[[Lycoperdon]]'', ''[[Calvatia]]'', and ''[[Utraria]]''. In 1989, German mycologist Hanns Kreisel described the genus ''Handkea'' to include species of ''Calvatia'' that had distinct microscopic features: ''Handkea'' species have a unique type of [[capillitium]] (coarse thick-walled [[hyphae]] in the [[gleba]]), with curvy slits instead of the usual pores.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Kreisel H|year=1989|title=Studies in the ''Calvatia'' complex (basidiomycetes)|journal=Nova Hedwigia|volume=48|issue=3–4|pages=281–96}}</ref> Although accepted by some authors,<ref name="isbn0-947643-81-8">{{cite book|vauthors=Laessøe T, Pegler DN, Spooner B |title=British puffballs, earthstars and stinkhorns: an account of the British gasteroid fungi|publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens|location=Kew|year=1995|isbn=0-947643-81-8}}</ref> the genus concept has been rejected by others.<ref name=Demoulin1990/>

In the past, the species (when it was known as ''Calvatia utriformis'') has been separated into three [[variety (botany)|varieties]] (''C.&nbsp;utriformis'' var. ''utriformis'', ''C.&nbsp;utriformis'' var. ''hungarica'' and ''C.&nbsp;utriformis'' var. ''gruberi'') based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer tissue layer of the wall, or [[peridium]]) and [[basidiospore|spores]]. However, a 1997 study of these characters revealed that the three varieties are not clearly demarcated.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Martin MP|title=Exoperidium and spores of ''Calvatia utriformis''|journal=Mycotaxon|volume=61|pages=381–87}}</ref> This study and others suggest that variations in the environmental conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect the development of these characteristics.<ref name=Demoulin1990>{{cite journal |vauthors=Demoulin V, Lange M | year = 1990 | title = ''Calvatia turneri'' (Ellis et Everh.)

[[Phylogenetic]] analyses published in 2008 shows that ''Handkea'' may be grouped in a [[clade]] along with species from several other genera, including ''[[Lycoperdon]]'', ''[[Vascellum]]'', ''[[Morganella (fungi)|Morganella]]'', ''[[Bovistella]]'', and ''[[Calvatia]]''.<ref name="pmid18207380">{{cite journal|vauthors=Larsson E, Jeppson M |title=Phylogenetic relationships among species and genera of Lycoperdaceae based on ITS and LSU sequence data from north European taxa|journal=Mycological Research|volume=112|issue=Pt 1|pages=4–22|year=2008|pmid=18207380|doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2007.10.018}}</ref> Published in the same year, another DNA analysis of the structure of [[internal transcribed spacer|ITS2]] [[Ribosomal DNA|rDNA]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcript]] confirmed that ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'' is closely related to ''[[Lycoperdon echinatum]]''.<ref name="pmid18342242">{{cite journal |vauthors=Krüger D, Gargas A |title=Secondary structure of ITS2 rRNA provides taxonomic characters for systematic studies&mdash;a case in Lycoperdaceae (Basidiomycota) |journal=Mycological Research |volume=112 |issue=Pt 3 |pages=316–30 |year=2008 |pmid=18342242 |doi=10.1016/j.mycres.2007.10.019 }}</ref>

==Description==
Like all [[puffballs]], ''Handkea utriformis'' has a gasteroid [[basidiocarp]], meaning the [[spore]]s are produced internally, and are only released as the mature [[fruiting body]] ages and dries, or is broken.[[image:Handkea-utriformis-MO.jpg|thumb|left|Specimen from [[Turkey]]]] Young puffballs are typically {{convert|6|to|12|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} across, white, or pale grey-brown;<ref name=Phillips06/> in maturity it may attain dimensions of {{convert|25|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} broad by {{convert|20|cm|in|frac=2|abbr=on}} tall.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Handkea utriformis">{{cite web|url=http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Handkea_utriformis.html|title=California Fungi: ''Handkea utriformis''|access-date=2009-04-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710091350/http://www.mykoweb.com/CAF/species/Handkea_utriformis.html|archive-date=2009-07-10}}</ref> The exoperidum is [[tomentose]]&mdash;densely covered with a layer of fine matted hairs. The species derives its common name "mosaic puffball" from the [[wikt:mosaic|mosaic]] pattern across the top and sides that develops as the fruiting body matures and the outer wall (''exoperidium'') breaks up into polygonal patches.<ref name="isbn0-412-36970-2">{{cite book|vauthors=Ellis JB, Ellis MB |title=Fungi without Gills (Hymenomycetes and Gasteromycetes): an Identification Handbook|publisher=Chapman and Hall|location=London|year=1990|page=224|isbn=0-412-36970-2}}</ref> The underside of the puffball is attached to the ground by a root-like assemblage of [[hyphae]] called  a [[mycelial cord|rhizomorph]].<ref>{{cite journal |author= Agerer|year=2002|title=Rhizomorph structures confirm the relationship between Lycoperdales and Agaricaceae (Hymenomycetes, Basidiomycota)|journal=Nova Hedwigia |volume=75 |issue=3–4 |pages=367–85 |doi= 10.1127/0029-5035/2002/0075-0367}}</ref> It is squat in appearance and roughly pear-shaped, not usually taller than it is wide. The flesh ([[gleba]], or spore bearing mass) is white when young, but becomes brown and powdery upon maturity. The upper skin eventually disintegrates weeks or even months after the puffball's appearance, and the brown spores are released into the air; this process is often hastened by rain, or by being trodden on by cattle. Eventually, all that remains is the sterile cup-shaped base, which can sometimes hold water. This feature may have been the source of the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]], as ''utrarius'' is [[Latin language|Latin]] for ‘water carrier’.<ref name="urlLatin Dictionary Definition and Information for: utrarius, utrari(i) -- LATdict Latin Dictionary and Resources">{{cite web|url=http://www.latin-dictionary.net/info/word/38244.html |title=Latin Dictionary Definition and Information for: utrarius, utrari(i) - LATdict Latin Dictionary and Resources |access-date=2009-06-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723175516/http://www.latin-dictionary.net/info/word/38244.html |archive-date=July 23, 2011 }}</ref>

===Microscopic features===
The [[spore]]s of ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'' are roughly spherical, smooth, and thick-walled, with a single oil droplet. They have dimensions of 4.5–5.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]].<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Handkea utriformis"/>

===Similar species===
A number of puffball species resemble ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'', including ''[[Calvatia cyathiformis]]s'', ''C.&nbsp;booniana'', and ''C.&nbsp;pachyderma''. ''Calvatia cyathiformis'' has a purple-colored gleba with a smooth exoperidium; ''C. booniana'' has an exoperidium that resembles felt or has tufts of soft "hairs" like ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'' but does not have any [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] and has a capillitium with rounded rather than sinuous pits; ''C.&nbsp;pachyderma'' has an exoperidium that is thicker and smoother than ''H.&nbsp;utriformis''.<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Handkea utriformis"/>

==Distribution and habitat==
''Handkea utriformis'' is widespread, and frequent in northern [[temperate zones]].<ref name=T.Laessoe>{{cite book| author = Laessoe T| year = 1998| title = Mushrooms (flexi bound)| publisher = Dorling Kindersley| isbn = 0-7513-1070-0}}</ref> It is found in Europe, continental Asia, Japan, eastern atlantic North America, Mexico, and South Africa.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bottomley AM|year=1948 |title=The Gasteromycetes of South Africa |journal=Bothalia |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=473–810|doi=10.4102/abc.v4i3.1859 |doi-access=free }}</ref> It has also been collected in Chile,<ref>{{cite journal |doi= 10.1002/fedr.19961070111 |vauthors=Kreisel H, Moreno G |year=1996 |title=The genus ''Handkea'' Kreisel (Basidiomycetes, Lycoperdaceae) in the southern hemisphere |journal=Feddes Repertorium |volume=107 |issue=1–2 |pages=83–87}}</ref> and New Zealand.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Gasteromycetes of Australia and New Zealand |author=Cunningham GH|year=1944 |location=Dunedin, New Zealand}}</ref> Growing alone or in small groups, it favors sandy open pastures, or [[heath (habitat)|heaths]], and is often found in coastal regions.

==Edibility==
[[image:Calvatia utriformis 1.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[gleba]] becomes dry and powdery in mature specimens]]
This fairly large [[puffball]] is edible only when the spore bearing flesh is young, and white.<ref name=Phillips06>{{cite book| author = Phillips R| year = 2006| title = Mushrooms| publisher = Pan MacMillan| isbn = 0-330-44237-6}}</ref> It is said to lack texture, and the taste and odor of the young fruiting bodies are described as "not distinctive".<ref name="urlCalifornia Fungi: Handkea utriformis"/> A 2007 study of the [[fatty acid]] composition of various edible Lycoperdaceae species determined the [[lipid]] content of ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'' to be quite low, approximately 1.8% (wet weight). The fatty acid content was largely [[linoleic acid]] (42.4%), [[oleic acid]] (23%), [[palmitic acid]] (12.2%), and [[stearic acid]] (3.6%); 17 other fatty acids of various chain lengths and degrees of [[unsaturated compound|unsaturation]] contributed to the total fatty acid composition.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nedelcheva D, Antonova D, Tsvetkova S, Marekov I, Momchilova S, Nikolova-Damyanova B, Gyosheva M |year=2007 |title=TLC and GC-MS probes into the fatty acid composition of some Lycoperdaceae mushrooms  |journal=Journal of Liquid Chromatography & Related Technologies |volume=30 |issue=18 |pages=2717–27 |doi= 10.1080/10826070701560629|s2cid=96089499 }}</ref>

==Antibiotic activity==
A 2005 study of the [[antimicrobial]] activity of several Lycoperdaceae revealed that ''Handkea utriformis'' has "significantly active" against a number of [[bacteria]], including ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Klebsiella pneumoniae]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Salmonella typhimurium]]'', ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium smegmatis]]''. On the other hand, ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'' has low [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] activity against the species ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Rhodotorula rubra]]'', and ''[[Kluyveromyces fragilis]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author= Dulger B|year=2005 |title=Antimicrobial activity of ten Lycoperdaceae |journal=Fitoterapia |volume=76 |issue=34 |pages=352–54 |doi= 10.1016/j.fitote.2005.02.004 |pmid= 15890468}}</ref>

==Bioaccumulation==
A study of the [[copper]] and [[zinc]] concentrations in 28 different species of edible mushroom showed that ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'' selectively [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulated]] both copper (251.9&nbsp;mg of copper per kilogram of mushroom) and zinc (282.1&nbsp;mg Zn/kg mushroom) to higher levels than all other mushrooms tested.<ref name="pmid12520390">{{cite journal|vauthors=Alonso J, García MA, Pérez-López M, Melgar MJ |title=The concentrations and bioconcentration factors of copper and zinc in edible mushrooms|journal=Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology|volume=44|issue=2|pages=180–88|year=2003|pmid=12520390|doi=10.1007/s00244-002-2051-0|s2cid=26965868}}<!--|access-date=2009-04-01--></ref> The authors note that although these [[Micronutrient|trace elements]] are important nutritional requirements for humans, and that ''H.&nbsp;utriformis'' may be considered a good source of these elements, it is known that absorption of the elements ([[bioavailability]]) from mushrooms is "low due to limited absorption from the small intestine".<ref>The authors (Alonso ''et al.'', 2003) cite from Kalač P, Nižnanská M, Bevilaqua D, Štašková I.
