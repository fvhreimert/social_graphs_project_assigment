'''''Agaricus litoralis''''', also known as the '''coastal mushroom''', is a species of mushroom in the genus ''[[Agaricus]]''.<ref name="MB114785"/><ref name="NBN">{{cite web |url=https://species.nbnatlas.org/species/NHMSYS0001473655 |title=''Agaricus litoralis'': Coastal Mushoom [sic!] |work=NBN Atlas |publisher=[[National Biodiversity Network]] |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref> It was first described by [[Elsie Maud Wakefield|Wakefield]] and A.

It occurs throughout Europe including Scandinavia and Great Britain. While it may be quite common locally, such as on [[Öland]] island, it is rarely found in most areas except for southern Europe. Its [[conservation status]] in Sweden is "near threatened".<ref name="SLU">{{cite web |url=https://artfakta.artdatabanken.se/taxon/2942 |title=Agaricus litoralis – Spetsfotad champinjon |language=Swedish |work=Artfakta |publisher=[[Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences]] |accessdate=3 February 2019}}</ref><ref name="NBN" />

==Description==
''A. litoralis'' is a white or grey-white mushroom with a compact cap that may reach a width of up to {{convert|12|cm|inch}}. The cap is often depressed when older and rests of the [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]] may occur on the outer rim. While rose-coloured at a young age, the [[Lamella (mycology)|gills]] become dark brown as the mushroom grows older. The stem is {{convert|5|-|6|cm|inch}} tall and {{convert|1.5|-|2|cm|inch}} wide. It is often remarkably shorter than the cap is wide. The [[spore]]s are dark brown and egg-shaped. The mushroom is [[saprotrophic]], i.e. it feeds on decaying matter. It prefers herbaceous dry grasslands, heaths and [[steppe]].<ref name="SLU" />
