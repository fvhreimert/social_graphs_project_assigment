'''''Cantharellus lateritius''''', commonly known as the '''smooth chanterelle''', is a species of [[edible mushroom|edible]] fungus in the [[mushroom]] family [[Cantharellaceae]]. The species has a complex [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history, and has undergone several name changes since its first [[species description|description]] by American mycologist [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]] in 1822. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface ([[hymenium]]) of the [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known [[golden chanterelle]], the hymenium of ''C.&nbsp;lateritius'' is much smoother.

[[Analytical chemistry|Chemical analysis]] has revealed the presence of several [[carotenoid]] compounds in the fruit bodies. Found in Asia, Africa, and North America, the species forms [[ectomycorrhiza]]l relationships.

The species was first [[species description|described]] in the scientific literature as ''Thelephora cantharella'' by the American [[Lewis David de Schweinitz]] in 1822, based on specimens collected in [[Ohio]].<ref name=Schweinitz1822/> [[Elias Magnus Fries]] later transferred it to ''[[Craterellus]]'' in his 1838 ''Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici''.<ref name=Fries1838/> In 1856, [[Miles Joseph Berkeley]] and [[Moses Ashley Curtis]] mentioned the fungus in their analysis of Schweinitz's specimens, but changed the [[specific name (botany)|epithet]], calling it ''Craterellus lateritius''.<ref name=Berkeley1856/> The motivation for the name change is unclear; [[Ronald H. Petersen]], in a 1979 publication, suggests that Berkeley "was apparently reluctant to surrender his own name for the organism".<ref name=Petersen1979/> Petersen suggests that Berkeley may have foreseen the necessity to avoid giving the species a [[tautonym]] (a situation where both the generic name and specific epithet are identical). However, as Petersen indicates, a future publication renders this explanation dubious: in 1873 Berkeley again referred to the species using his chosen name ''Craterellus lateritius'', and indicated a [[Type locality (biology)|type location]] ([[Alabama]]) different than the one mentioned by Schweinitz.<ref name=Berkeley1873/> Petersen considers Berkeley's name to be a ''[[nomen novum]]'' (new name), not a new species, as Berkeley clearly indicated that he thought ''Craterellus lateritius'' was [[synonym (taxonomy)|synonymous]] with Schweinitz's ''Thelephora cantharella''. Normally in these circumstances, Schweinitz's specimen would be considered the [[type (biology)|type]], but Petersen was unable to locate Schweinitz's original specimen, and thus according to the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature|rules of botanical nomenclature]], Berkeley's epithet has [[Principle of Priority|precedence]] as it is the earliest published name that has an associated type specimen.<ref name=Petersen1979/>

Another synonym is ''Trombetta lateritia'', used by [[Otto Kuntze]] in his 1891 ''[[Revisio Generum Plantarum]]''.<ref name=Kuntze1891/> American mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] transferred it to the genus ''Cantharellus'' in 1951.<ref name=Singer1951/> The mushroom is commonly known as the "smooth chanterelle".<ref name=Kuo2007/> The [[specific name (botany)|specific name]] ''lateritius'' means "bricklike", and refers to the smooth [[hymenium]].<ref name=Metzler1992/>

==Description==


The [[pileus (mycology)|caps]] of the ''C.&nbsp;lateritius'' [[basidiocarp|fruiting bodies]] typically range between {{convert|2|and|12|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} in diameter,<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=97}}</ref> with a flattened to somewhat funnel-shaped top surface and a wavy margin. The cap surface is dry, slightly [[wikt:tomentose|tomentose]] (covered with a layer of fine hairs), and a deep and bright orange-yellow color, with older specimens fading to more yellow in age; the distinctive margins of the cap are a paler yellow,<ref name=Bigelow1978/> and typically curve downward in young specimens.<ref name=Petersen1979/> Fruiting bodies can reach a height of {{convert|12|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}.<ref name=Petersen1979/>

The [[hymenophore]] (the spore-bearing surface) is initially smooth and without wrinkles, but gradually develops channels or ridges, and what appear to be very shallow [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] that are vein-like, and less than 1&nbsp;mm wide. The color is pale yellow, and is continuous with the surface of the stem. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is rather plump and stout, {{convert|1.5|to|10|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long and {{convert|0.5|to|2|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick, more or less cylindrical, tapering downwards towards the (sometimes white) base.<ref name=":02" /> Internally, the stems are either stuffed (filled with cotton-like [[mycelia]]) or solid. Rarely, fruiting bodies may be clumped together with stems conjoined at the base; in these cases there are usually no more than three fused stems.<ref name="Petersen1979" /> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is solid to partly hollow (sometimes due to insect larvae), with a pale yellow color;<ref name="Eyssartier2009" /> it is {{convert|0.5|to|0.9|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick.<ref name="Miller2006" />

The [[basidiospore|spores]] are smooth, with a roughly [[wikt:ellipsoid|ellipsoid]] shape, and have typical dimensions of 7–7.5 by 4.5–5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref>Bigelow (1978) reports more a permissive range of spore sizes: 7.5–9.5 (occasionally up to 12.5) by 4.5–6(6.5)&nbsp;μm</ref> In deposit, such as in a [[spore print]], the spores are light yellow orange,<ref name=Bigelow1978/> while under the microscope they are a very pale yellowish.<ref name="Eyssartier2009"/> The spore bearing cells—the [[basidia]]—are 75–80 by 7–9&nbsp;μm, 4-5-6-spored,<ref>Bigelow (1978) reports instead 35–72 by 5–7.5&nbsp;μm, and four spores.</ref> slightly club-shaped, and with a distinctly thickened wall at the base. [[Clamp connection]]s (short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of [[nucleus (cell)|nuclear]] division) are present in the [[hypha]]e of all parts of the fruiting body.<ref name="Eyssartier2009"/>

=== Bioactive compounds ===
In a 1998 study, the [[carotenoid]] composition of this species was compared to several other ''[[Cantharellus]]'' species, including ''[[Cantharellus cibarius|C.&nbsp;cibarus]]'', ''C.&nbsp;cibarius'' var. ''amythysteus'', and ''[[Cantharellus tabernensis|C.&nbsp;tabernensis]]''. The carotenoid content between species was "virtually identical", comprising {{Nowrap|[[γ-carotene]]}}, {{Nowrap|[[α-carotene]]}}, and {{Nowrap|[[β-carotene]]}}. The only significant difference was that ''C.&nbsp;lateritius'' contained a significant quantity of an unidentified carotene that was thought to be a [[chemical decomposition|breakdown product]] of β-carotene.<ref name="Mui1998" />

''Cantharellus lateritius'' is pinker than the golden chanterelle (''C.&nbsp;cibarius''),<ref name="Mui1998" /> and has thicker flesh in addition to the smoother hymenial surface.<ref name="Roody2003" /> ''[[Cantharellus odoratus|C.&nbsp;odoratus]]'' is also similar in appearance, and is distinguished by a thinner [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] and a hollow stem.<ref name="Bigelow1978" /> Microscopy or [[DNA analysis]] is required to distinguish ''[[Cantharellus flavolateritius|C.&nbsp;flavolateritius]]''.<ref name=":02" />

The [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] "Jack O'Lantern" mushroom, ''[[Omphalotus olearius]]'', is roughly similar in stature and color, but can be differentiated from ''C.&nbsp;lateritius'' by its true gills with sharply defined edges, and growth on decaying wood (although the wood may be buried in the soil), usually in large overlapping clusters.<ref name="Bessette1992" /> ''[[Craterellus odoratus]]'' is also similar.<ref name=":02" /><!-- Different from Cantharellus odoratus -->

One author considers ''C. lateritius'' to likely represent a [[species complex]], including "all the chanterelles with a completely smooth hymenophore, sweet smell, and clamped hyphae".<ref name="Eyssartier2009" />

==Distribution and habitat==
, Ohio]]

''Cantharellus lateritius'' is distributed in North America, Africa, Malaysia,<ref name="Eyssartier2009"/> and the [[Himalayas]] (specifically, the [[Almora]] hills in [[Uttar Pradesh]]).<ref name=Dhancholia1991/> In North America, it appears from June to September,<ref name=":02" /> with its range in the United States extending northward to [[Michigan]] and [[New England]].<ref name=Petersen1979/>

Typically found growing solitary, in groups or in clusters under [[hardwood]] trees, the fungus produces fruit bodies in the summer and autumn.<ref name=Miller2006/> In the [[New England]] area of the United States, mycologist Howard Bigelow has noted it to grow on road shoulders in grass near [[oak]]s;<ref name=Bigelow1978/> it also has a predilection for growing on sloping creek banks.<ref name=Metzler1992/> In Malaysia, it is found growing on the soil in forests, mostly under species of ''[[Shorea]]'' ([[rainforest]] trees in the family [[Dipterocarpaceae]]).<ref name="Eyssartier2009"/> ''C.&nbsp;lateritius'' has been reported from the [[Western Ghats]], [[Kerala]], India, forming [[ectomycorrhiza]]l association with [[endemism|endemic]] tree species like ''[[Vateria indica]]'', ''[[Hopea parviflora]]'', ''[[Diospyros malabarica]]'', and ''[[Myristica malabarica]]'' in semi-evergreen to evergreen forests.<ref name=Mohanan2011/>

== Edibility ==
Like all species in the genus ''Cantharellus'', ''C.&nbsp;lateritius'' is [[edible mushroom|edible]], and often considered choice.<ref name="Roody2003" /><ref name="McKnight1987" /><ref name="Miller2006" /> The odor resembles apricots, and the taste is mild,<ref name="Eyssartier2009" /> or "moderately to faintly acrid".<ref name="Petersen1979" /> In the opinion of McFarland and Mueller, authors of a field guide to edible fungi of [[Illinois]], compared to the well-known ''C.&nbsp;cibarius'', ''C.&nbsp;lateritius'' is "in general ... somewhat disappointing when compared with their delicious relatives".<ref name="Mueller2009" />
