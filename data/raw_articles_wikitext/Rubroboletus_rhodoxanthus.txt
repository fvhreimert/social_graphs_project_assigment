'''''Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus''''' is a species of [[bolete]] in the family [[Boletaceae]], native to [[Europe]]. Previously known as '''''Boletus rhodoxanthus''''', it was transferred in 2014 to the newly erected genus ''[[Rubroboletus]]'', based on [[DNA]] data.

It produces large, colourful [[Basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] with pink patches on the [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]], red pores in the [[hymenium|hymenial surface]] and has a robust [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] decorated in a dense, red-coloured network pattern. When longitudinally sliced, its flesh is distinctly bright yellow in the stem and discolours blue only in the cap, an excellent diagnostic feature distinguishing it from similar species.

The fungus is more widespread in warm [[broad-leaved]] forests of [[southern Europe]], where it grows in [[mycorrhizal]] [[symbiosis]] with trees of the family [[Fagaceae]], particularly oak (''[[Quercus]]'') and beech (''[[Fagus (plant)|Fagus]]''). However, it is rare in [[Northern Europe|northern regions]] and regarded as [[critically endangered]] or [[Extinction|extinct]] in some countries.

''Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus'' is generally regarded as inedible and may cause adverse gastrointestinal symptoms if consumed.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==

The fungus was first described  in 1836 by Czech [[mycologist]] [[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz]], who considered it to be a [[Variety (botany)|variety]] of ''Boletus sanguineus''.<ref>Krombholz JV von. (1836). Naturgetreue Abbildungen und Beschreibungen der Schwämme. 5: 1-17</ref> In 1925, it was recombined as a distinct [[species]] by German mycologist [[Franz Joseph Kallenbach]],<ref>Kallenbach FJ. (1925). Z. Pilzk. 5(1): 24</ref> and the fungus remained in genus ''[[Boletus]]'' until 2014. The species epithet is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''ρόδο'' (''rhódo'', "rose" or "pink") and ''ξανθός'' (''xanthós'', "blonde" or "fair").

The first extensive [[phylogenetic]] studies on [[Boletaceae]] in 2006<ref name="Binder&Hibbett 2006"/> and 2013,<ref name="Nuhn 2013"/> indicated that ''[[Boletus]]'' was not [[monophyletic]] and hence an artificial arrangement. A 2014 study by Wu and colleagues recognised 22 generic [[clade]]s within [[Boletaceae]], concluding that ''[[Boletus dupainii]]'' and some closely related red-pored species belong to a distinct clade, distant from the core clade of ''Boletus'' (comprising ''[[Boletus edulis]]'' and allied taxa).<ref name="Wu 2014"/> The new genus ''[[Rubroboletus]]'' was therefore described to accommodate species in this clade and ''B. rhodoxanthus'' was transferred to this genus.<ref name="Zhao 2014"/> The placement of the species in genus ''[[Suillellus]]'', following an online recombination by Blanco-Dios,<ref>Blanco-Dios JB. (2015). Nomenclatural novelties. Index Fungorum. 211: 1-2</ref> was not supported by molecular data and has been subsequently rejected by later authors.<ref>Wu G, Li YC, Zhu XT, Zhao K, Han LH, Cui YY, Li F, Xu J, Yang ZL. (2016). One hundred noteworthy boletes from China. Fungal Diversity 81(1): 25–188.</ref><ref name=Tibpromma2017/><ref name="zhao17"/><ref name="Loizides 2019"/>

==Description==
The [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]] is at first hemispherical, gradually becoming convex to almost flat as the fungus expands, with a diameter of {{convert|10|to|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}, but can sometimes grow up to {{convert|30|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}}. It is at first slightly velvety and coloured mostly whitish-grey, but soon becomes smooth, pinkish-grey, pinkish-beige or pinkish-red, especially towards the margin or when handled.<ref name="Ellis & Ellis 1990"/><ref name="Breitenbach 1991"/><ref name="Garnweidner 1994"/>

The [[Hymenium|tubes]] are adnate to emarginate, {{convert|0.5|to|1.5|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long and initially yellow, becoming somewhat olivaceous-yellow in very mature fruit bodies and staining blue when cut. The pores (tube mouths) are orange to deep red and instantly bluing when handled.<ref name="Galli 2007"/><ref name="Loizides et al. 2011"/>

The [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|8|to|12|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|3|to|6|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, bulbous or clavate when young, becoming more elongated and cylindrical at maturity. It is orange or orange-yellow at the top (apex), gradually becoming orange-red to carmine-red in the lower part and bears a dense, orange-red to carmine-red reticulation (network pattern).<ref name="Courtecuisse 1995"/><ref name=Phillips06/>



The [[Trama (mycology)|flesh]] is distinctly bright yellow and unchanging in the stem, but paler and turning blue when cut only in the cap. It has a mild taste.<ref name="Kibby 2016"/>

The [[spore]]s are olive-brown in mass. When viewed under the microscope they are [[ellipsoid]] to fusiform (spindle-shaped), measuring 10–15.5 by 4–5.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]]. The [[cap cuticle]] is a trichodermium of septate cylindrical [[hyphae]], sometimes finely incrusted.<ref name="Breitenbach 1991"/><ref name="Munoz 2005"/>


===Similar species===

*''[[Rubroboletus legaliae]]'' is very similar, but has a distinctive smell of [[chicory]] or [[hay]] and whitish flesh that stains blue in the cap, as well as the stem when cut.
*''[[Rubroboletus satanas]]'' has a whitish cap without flushes of pink and whitish flesh that usually stains pale blue also in the stem when cut.
*''[[Rubroboletus rubrosanguineus]]'' is mycorrhizal with spruce (''[[Picea]]'') or fir (''[[Abies]]'') and has pale yellow flesh that stains blue throughout.
*''[[Rubroboletus demonensis]]'', so far known only from [[southern Italy]] ([[Calabria]] and [[Sicily]]), has usually brighter colours on the cap ranging from pale grey to blood-red or purple, has yellow flesh that stains weakly to moderately blue throughout and microscopically has smaller spores, measuring 12.5–14 × 4.5–5 μm.
*''[[Imperator rhodopurpureus]]'' differs by its pinkish-red to crimson-red cap that has a roughened or "hammered" appearance and stains blue when handled, but also by its flesh that stains intensely dark blue throughout.

==Distribution and habitat==
Regarded as a rare species in northern [[Europe]], ''Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus'' is more frequently encountered in warm, [[southern Europe|southern]] regions. It forms [[ectomycorrhizal]] associations with members of the [[Fagaceae]], particularly oak (''[[Quercus]]'') and beech (''[[Fagus (plant)|Fagus]]''), but sometimes also with chestnut (''[[Castanea (plant)|Castanea]]'').<ref name="Munoz 2005"/><ref name="Galli 2007"/> Molecular [[phylogenetic]] testing has confirmed its presence in [[France]],<ref name="Loizides 2019"/> [[Italy]],<ref name="Zhao 2014"/> [[Portugal]]<ref name="Martin & Raidl 2002"/> and the islands of [[Cyprus]]<ref name="Loizides 2019"/> and [[Sardinia]],<ref name="Zhao 2014"/> but it is probably widespread throughout most of the [[Mediterranean region]].<ref name="Courtecuisse 1995"/><ref name="Munoz 2005"/>

It has been reported as locally frequent on the island of [[Cyprus]], where it appears in seasons with early rainfall, growing on [[serpentine soil]] under the endemic golden oak (''[[Quercus alnifolia]]'').<ref name="Loizides 2011"/> In contrast, it is considered [[critically endangered]] in the [[Czech Republic]]<ref name="Mikšik 2012"/> and reported as [[Extinction|extinct]] in [[England]].<ref name=Phillips06/> In the [[British Islands]] it known only from [[Northern Ireland]].<ref name="Kibby 2016"/>

==Toxicity==
''Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus'' is generally regarded as inedible<ref name="Breitenbach 1991"/> or even poisonous,<ref name="Hall 2003"/><ref name=Phillips06/><ref name="zhao17"/> and can cause an adverse gastrointestinal reaction if eaten. In the Colour Atlas of Poisonous Fungi,<ref name="Bresinsky"/> Bresinsky and Besl claim that the fungus might be edible if thoroughly cooked, but warn against collecting it because of its rarity and possibility of confusion with ''[[Rubroboletus satanas|R. satanas]]''.
