'''''Polyozellus'''''  is a fungal [[genus]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] Thelephoraceae, a grouping of [[mushroom]]s known collectively as the [[leathery earthfans]]. Previously considered a [[monotypic taxon|monotypic]] genus, it now contains the ''Polyozellus multiplex'' [[species complex]]. The genus name is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''poly'' meaning ''many'', and ''oz'', meaning ''branch''. It is [[common name|commonly]] known as the '''blue chanterelle''', the '''clustered blue chanterelle''', '''bluefan''',<ref>Siegel, Noah; Schwarz, Christian (September 1, 2024). ''Mushrooms of Cascadia: A Comprehensive Guide to Fungi of the Pacific Northwest''. Humboldt County, CA: Backcountry Press. p. 45. {{ISBN|9781941624197}}.</ref> or, in [[Alaska]], the '''black chanterelle'''. The distinctive [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] of this species comprises blue- to purple-colored clusters of vase- or spoon-shaped [[Pileus (mycology)|caps]] with veiny wrinkles on the undersurface that run down the length of the [[Stipe (mycology)|stem]].

''Polyozellus'' has had a varied [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] history and has been [[classification (biology)|reclassified]] several times at both the [[family (biology)|family]] and genus level.  The [[range (biology)|range]] of ''Polyozellus'' includes North America and eastern Asia, where it grows on the ground of [[temperate coniferous forest|coniferous forests]], usually under [[spruce]] and [[fir]] trees. It contains [[edible mushroom|edible]] species, and has been harvested for commercial purposes.

==Taxonomy==

The first published [[species description|description]] of the species was written by botanist [[Lucien Marcus Underwood|Lucien M. Underwood]] in 1899, based on a specimen found the previous year in the woods of [[Mount Desert, Maine]]. Although he called the new species a ''[[Cantharellus]]'', he noted that "the plant is a remarkable one and from its habit might well form a distinct genus since it has little in common with ''Cantharellus'' except its fold-like gills."<ref name=Underwood1899/> In 1910, [[William Murrill]] transferred it to the new genus ''Polyozellus''; Murrill thought the compound structure of the stem to be a sufficiently unique characteristic to warrant it being separated from ''Cantharellus'' species, which have simpler stem structures.<ref name=Murrill1910/> In 1920, specimens from a Japanese collection compiled by A.&nbsp;Yasuda were sent to mycologist [[Curtis Gates Lloyd]], who believed the fungus to be a new species and named it ''Phyllocarbon yasudai''.<ref name=Lloyd1921/>

 of ''[[Gomphus clavatus]]'', shown here.]]
No further collections of the fungus were reported until 1937, when it was found in [[Quebec]], Canada.<ref name=Mounce1937/> The next year, Paul Shope considered the genus ''Polyozellus'' to be superfluous, pointed out that the compound [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] and the wrinkled [[hymenium]] were instead consistent with the genus ''[[Craterellus]]''.<ref name=Shope1938/> In 1939, American mycologist [[Lee Oras Overholts]], in a letter to the journal ''[[Mycologia]]'', opined that both of these authors had overlooked a 1925 publication by [[Calvin Henry Kauffman]], who made notes and photos of the species collected in the [[Rocky Mountains]] of [[Wyoming]] and [[Colorado]], and in the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountains]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]].<ref name=Kauffman1925/> Kauffman believed the species to be merely "a very extreme growth condition" of ''Cantharellus clavatus'' (now known as ''[[Gomphus clavatus]]'') and suggested there was no reason for transferring the species to the genus ''Craterellus''.<ref name=Overholts1939/> Mycologists [[Alexander Hanchett Smith|Alexander H.&nbsp;Smith]] and [[Elizabeth Eaton Morse]], in their 1947 publication on ''Cantharellus'' species in the United States, placed the species in a new section ''Polyozellus'', but did not separate it from the genus ''Cantharellus''; they defined the distinguishing characteristics of ''Polyozellus'' as the small, roughened, [[hyaline]] spores and the color change of the flesh in [[potassium hydroxide]] solution, adding that "the spores are unusual for the genus but in our estimation do not warrant excluding the species."<ref name=Smith1947/>
]]
In 1953, Rokuya Imazeki took into consideration differences in [[Basidiospore|spore]] characteristics: species in the genus ''Cantharellus'' were not known to have spores that were subglobose (roughly spherical) and tuberculate (covered with wart-like projections) like ''Polyozellus''; however, these spore characteristics were common in species in the family Thelephoraceae (''Cantharellus'' belongs in a different family, the [[Cantharellaceae]]). Other characteristics linking the blue chanterelle with the Thelephoraceae included the dark color, the strong odor (especially in dried specimens), and the presence of [[thelephoric acid]], a mushroom [[pigment]] common in the family. Taken together, these factors led Imazeki to propose the new family Phylacteriaceae.<ref name=Sawada1952/> The suggested family-level [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomical]] change was not accepted by other authors; for example, in 1954, Seiichi Kawamura renamed it ''Thelephora multiplex''.<ref name=Kawamura1954/>

In 2017, researchers from eastern Europe and North America collaborated on a molecular phylogeny of the previously monotypic ''Polyozellus multiplex''.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Voitk |first1=Andrus |last2=Saar |first2=Irja |last3=Trudell |first3=Steven |last4=Spirin |first4=Viacheslav |last5=Beug |first5=Michael |last6=Kõljalg |first6=Urmas |date=2017-11-02 |title=Polyozellus multiplex (Thelephorales) is a species complex containing four new species |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00275514.2017.1416246 |journal=Mycologia |language=en |volume=109 |issue=6 |pages=975–992 |doi=10.1080/00275514.2017.1416246 |pmid=29494282 |s2cid=4149082 |issn=0027-5514|url-access=subscription }}</ref> They determined that ''Polyozellus'' contains five species that are distinguished by spore size and geographic region: the small-spored ''[[Polyozellus multiplex|P.&nbsp;multiplex]]'' and ''P.&nbsp;atrolazulinus'' and the large-spored ''P.&nbsp;mariae, P.&nbsp;marymargaretae'', and ''P.&nbsp;purpureoniger.'' As of 2022, both [[Index Fungorum]]<ref name="urlFungorum" /> and [[MycoBank]]<ref name="urlStalpers2009" /> list ''Polyozellus'' as being within the family [[Thelephoraceae]], a grouping of mushrooms commonly known as the [[leathery earthfans]].<ref name="Pilz p17 2003">Pilz ''et al''., p. 17.</ref>

[[Common name]]s for this genus include the blue chanterelle and the clustered blue chanterelle.<ref name="Ammirati1987" /> In [[Alaska]], where specimens typically have very dark-colored fruit bodies, it is called the black chanterelle,<ref name="Pilz p38 2003">Pilz ''et al''., p. 38.</ref> although this name is shared with some ''[[Craterellus]]'' species.<ref name="Arora1991" />
