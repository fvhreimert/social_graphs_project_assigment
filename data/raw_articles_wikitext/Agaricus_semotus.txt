'''''Agaricus semotus''''' is a woodland mushroom of the fungus [[order (biology)|order]] ''[[Agaricales]]''. Like many of its relatives, it can be found spread throughout wooded, moist areas in the southern United States, and has been found in areas ranging from [[California]] to [[Florida]]. It is also indigenous to [[Great Britain]] and [[Europe]]. ''A. semotus'' has also been collected in [[New Zealand]].<ref>Mitchell AD, Walter M. (1999). "Species of ''Agaricus'' occurring in New Zealand". ''New Zealand Journal of Botany'' '''37'''(4): 715&ndash;25.</ref> Although various authors disagree about its edibility, its modest size prevents it from being a significant source of nutrition.

==Description==

The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is 2&ndash;7&nbsp;cm in diameter, initially convex while flattening with age; it typically has a low umbo&ndash;a raised, conical mound in the center of the cap.<ref name="isbn0-7627-3109-5">{{cite book |vauthors =Miller HR, Miller OK |title=North American mushrooms: a field guide to edible and inedible fungi |publisher=Falcon Guide |location=Guilford, Conn |year=2006 |page=281 |isbn=0-7627-3109-5 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=zjvXkLpqsEgC&pg=PA274&dq=%22agaricus+semotus%22#PPA281,M1 Google Books]</ref> The surface color can range from a lighter cream to a darker tan, with brownish scales thinning out towards the margin of the cap. The [[Lamella (mycology)|gill]]s are free from the stalk and packed closely together, showing a pink to salmon color in youth and aging to a darker brown.

The [[Stipe (mycology)|stalk]] is 3&ndash;7&nbsp;cm tall and 0.4&ndash;0.8&nbsp;cm broad, and bruises yellow when handled. A [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] or remnants thereof are often evident, while the [[partial veil]] is often absent or minutely visible along the margin of the cap. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is white throughout and stains yellow when bruised. The [[spore print]] is [[brown|dark brown]].

The taste is said to be slightly reminiscent of anise or almond while the odor is often more distinctive.

The [[spore]]s are 4.5&ndash;5.5 x 3&ndash;3.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], smooth, [[nonamyloid]], and elliptical. The [[basidia]], the spore-bearing cells, are 4-spored, while the [[cystidia]] (relatively large non-spore producing cells typically found on the [[hymenium]]) are roughly club-shaped with thin walls.<ref name="isbn0-7112-2379-3">{{cite book |author =Jordan, Michael |title=The encyclopedia of fungi of Britain and Europe |publisher=Frances Lincoln |location=London |year=2004 |page=225 |isbn=0-7112-2379-3 }}</ref>

==Phylogenetics==
[[Phylogenetic]] analysis shows ''A. semotus'' to be closely related to a [[clade]] known as subgenus ''Flavoagaricus'' or section ''Arvense''. This clade also includes the species ''[[Agaricus silvicola|A. silvicola]]'', ''[[Agaricus arvensis|A. arvensis]]'' and ''[[Agaricus abruptibulbus|A. abruptibulbus]]''; these species also bruise yellow, and smell of almonds.<ref>Mitchell AD, Bresinsky A. (1999). "Phylogenetic relationships of ''Agaricus'' species based on ITS-2 and 28S ribosomal DNA sequences". ''[[Mycologia]]'', '''91'''(5): 811&ndash;19.</ref> However, analysis of additional species suggests ''A. semotus'' properly belongs to the distinct subgenus ''Minores'', which includes the smaller relatives of the ''Arvense'' clade (and was formerly included there).
