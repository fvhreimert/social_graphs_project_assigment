'''''Hydnum repandum''''', commonly known as the '''sweet tooth''', '''pig's trotter''',<ref name="Arora 1986"/> '''wood hedgehog''' or '''hedgehog mushroom''', is a [[basidiomycete]] fungus of the family [[Hydnaceae]]. First [[species description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in 1753, it is the [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Hydnum]]''. The fungus produces [[fruit bodies]] (mushrooms) that are characterized by their [[Basidiospore|spore]]-bearing structures—in the form of spines rather than [[lamella (mycology)|gills]]—which hang down from the underside of the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]]. The cap is dry, colored yellow to light orange to brown, and often develops an irregular shape, especially when it has grown closely crowded with adjacent fruit bodies. The [[mushroom tissue]] is white with a pleasant odor and a spicy or bitter taste. All parts of the mushroom stain orange with age or when bruised.

A [[mycorrhiza]]l fungus, ''Hydnum repandum'' is broadly distributed in Europe<ref name="Swenie Baroni Matheny pp. 35–72">{{cite journal | last1=Swenie | first1=Rachel A. | last2=Baroni | first2=Timothy J. | last3=Matheny | first3=P.

It has no poisonous lookalikes.

== Taxonomy ==
First officially [[species description|described]] by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in his 1753 ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', ''Hydnum repandum'' was [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] by Swedish mycologist [[Elias Fries]] in 1821.<ref name="Fries 1821"/> The species has been shuffled among several genera: ''Hypothele'' by French naturalist [[Jean-Jacques Paulet]] in 1812; ''Dentinum'' by British botanist [[Samuel Frederick Gray]] in 1821; ''Tyrodon'' by Finnish mycologist [[Petter Karsten]] in 1881; ''[[Sarcodon]]'' by French naturalist [[Lucien Quélet]] in 1886.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Hydnum repandum"/> After a 1977 [[binomial nomenclature|nomenclatural]] proposal by American mycologist [[Ron Petersen|Ronald H. Petersen]]<ref name="Petersen 1977"/> was accepted, ''Hydnum repandum'' became the official [[type species]] of the genus ''Hydnum''. Previously, supporting arguments for making ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' the type were made by Dutch taxonomist [[Marinus Anton Donk]] (1958)<ref name="Donk 1958"/> and Petersen (1973),<ref name="Petersen 1973"/> while Czech mycologist [[Zdeněk Pouzar]] (1958)<ref name="Pouzar 1958"/> and Canadian mycologist [[Kenneth A. Harrison|Kenneth Harrison]] (1971) thought that ''[[Sarcodon imbricatus|H.&nbsp;imbricatum]]'' should be the type.<ref name="Harrison 1971"/>

Several [[form (botany)|forms]] and [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' have been described. Forms ''albidum'' and ''rufescens'', found in Russia, were published by T.L. Nikolajeva in 1961;<ref name="Nikolajeva 1961"/> the latter [[taxon]] is [[synonym (biology)|synonymous]] with ''[[Hydnum rufescens|H.&nbsp;rufescens]]''.<ref name="urlMycoBank: Hydnum repandum f. rufescens "/> Form ''amarum'', published from Slovenia by Zlata Stropnik, Bogdan Tratnik and Garbrijel Seljak in 1988,<ref name="Stropnik 1988"/> is illegitimate as per article 36.1 of the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]], as it was not given a sufficiently comprehensive description. French botanist [[Jean-Baptiste Barla]] described ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' var. ''rufescens'' in 1859.<ref name="Barla 1859"/> English naturalist [[Carleton Rea]] described the white-fruit bodied version as a variety—''H.&nbsp;repandum'' var. ''album''—in 1922.<ref name="Rea 1922"/>

[[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular]] studies have shown that the current [[species concept]] for ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' needed revision as there was a poor overlap between [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] and molecular species concepts. A 2009 [[phylogenetic]] analysis of European specimens, based on [[internal transcribed spacer]] and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicated that ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' specimens form two distinct [[clade]]s, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences foreshadowed the presence of undescribed [[cryptic species]], and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive [[speciation]].<ref name="Grebenc 2009"/> A comprehensive genetic study published in 2016 of members of the genus worldwide found that there are at least four species in the broad concept of ''H.&nbsp;repandum'': two species from southern China, one from Europe and eastern North America, and ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' itself from Europe and northern (and alpine southwestern) China and Japan. Although it is missing from Central America, genetic material has been recovered from Venezuela from the tree ''[[Pakaraimaea|Pakaraimaea dipterocarpacea]]'', suggesting it somehow migrated there and had changed hosts.<ref name=feng16/>

The [[botanical name|specific epithet]] ''repandum'' means "bent back", referring to the wavy cap margin. The varietal epithet ''album'' means "white as an egg".<ref name="Roody 2003"/> ''Hydnum repandum'' has been given several [[common name|vernacular names]]: "sweet tooth",<ref name="Phillips 2005"/> "yellow tooth fungus",<ref name="Schalkwijk-Barendsen 1991"/> "wood urchin",<ref name="Pegler 1997"/> "spreading hedgehog",<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> "hedgehog mushroom", or "pig's trotter".<ref name="Arora 1986"/> The variety ''album'' is known as "white wood".<ref name="Roody 2003"/>

== Description ==


The orange-, yellow- or tan-colored [[Pileus (mycology)|pileus]] (cap) is up to {{convert|17|cm|frac=2}} wide, although specimens measuring {{convert|25|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} have been documented. It is generally somewhat irregular in shape (possibly being convex or concave at maturity), with a wavy margin that is rolled inward when young.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> Caps grow in a distorted shape when [[fruit bodies]] are closely clustered.<ref name="Laessoe 2002"/> The cap surface is generally dry and smooth, although mature specimens may show cracking.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> Viewed from above, the caps of mature specimens resemble somewhat those of chanterelles.<ref name="urlHydnum"/> The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick, white, firm, brittle, and bruises yellow to orange-brown. The underside is densely covered with small, slender whitish spines measuring {{convert|2–7|mm|frac=16|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> These spines sometimes run down at least one side of the [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]].<ref name="Pegler 1997"/> The stipe, typically {{convert|3–10|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1–3|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} thick, is either white or the same color as the cap, and is sometimes off-center.<ref name="Arora 1986"/> It is easy to overlook the mushrooms when they are situated amongst [[agaric|gilled mushrooms]] and [[bolete]]s, because the cap and stipe are fairly nondescript and the mushrooms must be turned over to reveal their spines.<ref name="Abel 1993"/> The pure white variety of this species, ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' var. ''album'', is smaller than the main variety, with a cap measuring {{convert|2–7|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} wide and a stipe that is {{convert|1–3|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} long.<ref name="Roody 2003"/>

The [[spore print]] is pale [[cream (colour)|cream]]. The [[basidiospore]]s are smooth, thin-walled and [[hyaline]] (translucent), roughly spherical to broadly egg-shaped, and measure 5.5–7.5 by 4.5–5.5&nbsp;[[μm]]. They usually contain a single, large [[refractive]] oil droplet. The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 30–45 by 6–10&nbsp;μm. The [[cap cuticle]] is a trichodermium (where the outermost [[hypha]]e emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface) of narrow, club-shaped cells that are 2.5–4&nbsp;μm wide. Underneath this tissue is the subhymenial layer of interwoven hyphae measuring 10–20&nbsp;μm in diameter. The spine tissue is made of narrow (2–5&nbsp;μm diameter), thin-walled hyphae with [[clamp connection]]s.<ref name="Pegler 1997"/>


=== Chemistry ===
Both ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' and the variety ''album'' contain the [[epoxide|diepoxide]] compound [[repandiol]] (2''R'',3''R'',8''R'',9''R'')-4,6-decadiyne-2,3:8,9-diepoxy-1,10-diol), which is under laboratory research to determine its possible effects.<ref name="Takahashi 1992" /> The [[volatile organic compound]]s responsible for the fruity aroma of the mushroom include eight-[[carbon]] derivatives, such as [[1-octen-3-ol]], (''E'')-2-octenol, and (''E'')-[[1,3-octadiene]].<ref name="Fons 2003" />

European studies conducted after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]] showed that the fruit bodies have a high rate of [[bioaccumulation|accumulation]] of the radioactive isotope [[caesium]].<ref name="Stachowiak 2012" />

=== Similar species ===
North American lookalikes include the white hedgehog (''[[Hydnum albidum]]'') and the giant hedgehog (''[[Hydnum albomagnum|H.&nbsp;albomagnum]]''). ''H.&nbsp;albidum'' has a white to pale yellowish grey fruit body that bruises yellow to orange. ''H.&nbsp;albomagnum'' is large and paler than ''H.&nbsp;repandum''.<ref name="Roberts 2011" /> ''[[Hydnum umbilicatum]]'' is smaller, with caps measuring {{convert|3–5|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} in diameter, and thinner stipes that are {{convert|0.5–1|cm|frac=4|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name="Davis 2012" /> Its caps are umbilicate (with a navel-like cavity), sometimes with a hole in the center of the cap,<ref name="Laessoe 2002" /> unlike the flattened or slightly depressed caps of ''H.&nbsp;repandum''.<ref name="Roody 2003" /> Microscopically, ''H.&nbsp;umbilicatum'' has spores that are larger and more elliptical than those of ''H.&nbsp;repandum'', measuring 7.5–9 by 6–7.5&nbsp;μm.<ref name="urlHydnum" /> A European lookalike, ''[[Hydnum rufescens|H.&nbsp;rufescens]]'', is also smaller than ''H.&nbsp;repandum'', and has a deeper [[apricot (color)|apricot]] to orange color.<ref name="Sterry 2009" /> ''[[Hydnum ellipsosporum]]'', described as a new species from Germany in 2004, differs from ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' by the shape and length of its spores, which are [[ellipsoid]] and measure 9–11 by 6–7.5&nbsp;μm. Compared to ''H.&nbsp;repandum'', it has smaller fruit bodies, with cap diameters ranging from {{convert|3 to 5|cm|frac=2|abbr=on}} wide.<ref name="Ostrow 2004" />

== Habitat and distribution ==

=== Nutrition ===
Dried ''H. repandum'' is 56% [[carbohydrate]]s, 4% [[fat]], and 20% [[protein (nutrient)|protein]]. In a 100 gram reference amount, several [[mineral (nutrient)|dietary minerals]] are high in content, especially [[copper]] and [[manganese]]. Major [[fatty acid]]s include [[palmitic acid]] (16%), [[stearic acid]] (1%), [[oleic acid]] (26%), [[linoleic acid]] (48%), and [[linolenic acid]] (20%). [[plant sterol|Mycosterol]] is present.<ref name="Kalač 2009"/>

===Culinary===

''H. repandum'' is considered to be a good [[edible mushroom]], having a sweet, nutty taste and a crunchy texture. Some consider it to be the culinary equivalent of the [[chanterelle]].<ref name="Ammirati 1987"/> Author Michael Kuo rates it as "great", noting that there are no [[mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] lookalikes and that ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' mushrooms are unlikely to be infested with maggots.

Delicately brushing the cap and stipe of specimens immediately after harvest will help prevent soil from getting lodged between the teeth. ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' mushrooms can be cooked by [[pickling]],<ref name="Mabey 2007"/> [[simmering]] in milk or [[stock (food)|stock]], and [[sautéeing]], which creates a "tender, meaty texture and a mild flavor."<ref name="Kuo 2007"/> The mushroom tissue absorbs liquids well and assumes the flavors of added ingredients.<ref name="Kuo 2007"/> The firm texture of the cooked mushroom makes it suitable for freezing. Its natural flavor is reportedly similar to the peppery taste of [[watercress]],<ref name="Abel 1993"/> or [[oyster]]s.<ref name="Sept 2006"/> Older specimens may have a bitter taste, but boiling can remove the bitterness.<ref name="Mabey 2007"/> Specimens found under conifers can taste "unpleasantly strong".<ref name="Courtecuisse 1999"/> The form ''amarum'', locally common in Slovakia, is reportedly inedible because its fruit body has a bitter taste at all developmental stages.<ref name="Stropnik 1988"/>

''Hydnum repandum'' is frequently sold with chanterelles in Italy, and in France, it is one of the officially recognized edible species sold in markets.<ref name="Dickinson 1982"/> In Europe, it is usually sold under its French name ''pied-de-mouton'' (sheep's foot).<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> ''H.&nbsp;repandum'' mushrooms are also used as a food source by the [[red squirrel]] (''Sciurus vulgaris'').<ref name="Grönwall 1984"/>
