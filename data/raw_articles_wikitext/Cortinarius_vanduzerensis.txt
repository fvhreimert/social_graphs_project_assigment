'''''Cortinarius vanduzerensis''''' is a species of fungus described as new to science in 1972. The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of the fungus, or [[mushroom]]s, have a slimy dark [[chestnut (color)|chestnut]]-brown [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] that becomes deeply radially grooved or [[wikt:corrugated|corrugated]] in maturity, and reaches diameters of up to {{convert|8|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}}. The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] on the underside of the cap are initially pinkish-buff before becoming pale brown when the [[Basidiospore|spores]] mature. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is lavender, measuring {{convert|10–18|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}} long and {{convert|1–2|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick. The mushroom produces a rusty-brown [[spore print]], with individual spores measuring 12–14 by 7–8&nbsp;[[μm]].

The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the species is unknown and it resembles [[poisonous mushrooms]]. It is known only from the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America, where it grows under [[conifer]]s such as [[spruce]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]], and [[Douglas-fir]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was described in 1972 by mycologists [[Alexander H. Smith]] and [[James M. Trappe]], based on specimens they found in [[Cascade Head]] in [[Tillamook County, Oregon]], in October and November 1970.<ref name=Smith1972/> The species had also been called ''[[Cortinarius elatior]]'', but that name refers to a European species.<ref name=Trudell2009/>  Within the genus ''[[Cortinarius]]'', ''C.&nbsp;vanduzerensis'' is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[subgenus]] ''Myxacium''.<ref name=Smith1972/> This subgenus includes species in which both the cap and stem are sticky as a result of a glutinous [[universal veil]].<ref name=Kibby2009/> Based on the [[nucleic acid sequence]] similarity in the [[internal transcribed spacer]] region, ''C.&nbsp;vanduzerensis'' is closely related to the European and North American ''[[Cortinarius mucifluus|C.&nbsp;mucifluus]]'' and the Costa Rican species ''[[Cortinarius costaricensis|C.&nbsp;costaricensis]]''.<ref name=Ammirati2007/>

A [[common name]] for the species is the "pointed Cortinarius", while the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''vanduzerensis'' refers to the [[H. B. Van Duzer Forest State Scenic Corridor|H.&nbsp;B. van Duzer Forest]] where the species was originally collected.<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/>

==Description==
Young [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] of ''C.&nbsp;vanduzerensis'' are covered with a slimy [[universal veil]];<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> the slime layer persists on the [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] of young mushrooms, or in moist weather. The shape of the cap is oval to conical with the margin initially [[wikt:appressed|appressed]], expanding to broadly conic or somewhat flattened in maturity, eventually reaching diameters of {{convert|3.5–9|cm|abbr=on|frac=4}}.<ref name="audu">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |pages=646}}</ref> The cap color is initially chestnut-brown to black, but becomes paler brown as it matures. The surface is radially wrinkled or corrugated, especially near the margin. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is pallid but soon pale cinnamon-buff. The odor and taste are not distinctive. A drop of [[Iron(II) sulfate|FeSO<sub>4</sub>]] solution (a reagent commonly used in [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|mushroom identification]]) applied to the surface of the cap will turn olive-green.<ref name=Smith1972/>

The [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are pinkish-buff when young (in unopened caps), dull cinnamon-brown at maturity when the spores mature. They are packed close together, and are adnate or adnexed. The [[stipe (mycology)|stem]] is {{convert|7–20|cm|abbr=on|round=0.5}} long,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R. Michael|title=Field Guide to Mushrooms of Western North America|last2=Sommer|first2=Robert|last3=Menge|first3=John A.|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2012|isbn=978-0-520-95360-4|location=Berkeley|pages=266|oclc=797915861}}</ref> {{convert|1–2|cm|abbr=on|frac=8}} thick,<ref name="audu" /> narrowed slightly to the base. It is pallid within but slowly cinnamon buff at least near the base. The stem surface has a thick slime-veil, and is [[lavender (color)|lavender]] to light purple on the upper portion, but darker on the lower portion. Sometimes the [[universal veil]] breaks up into concentric zones over the lower third of the stem.<ref name=Smith1972/>

The [[edible mushroom|edibility]] of the mushroom is not known.<ref name="urlCalifornia"/> [[David Arora]] notes that it is "much too slippery to be of value".<ref name=Arora1986/> It is also not recommended due to its similarity to deadly [[Mushroom poisoning|poisonous]] species.<ref name=":0" />

The [[spore print]] is a rusty-brown color. In face view, the [[Basidiospore|spores]] are broadly elliptic to [[wikt:ovate|ovate]] (egg-shaped), while in profile they appear broadly inequilateral; they have dimensions of 12–14 by 7–8&nbsp;[[μm]]. The spore surface is roughened with warts, and they lack an [[germ pore|apical pore]]. The spores contain two [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]].<ref name=Horton2006/> The [[basidia]] (spore-bearing cells in the [[hymenium]]) are four-spored, broadly club-shaped, and have contents that are often in the form of yellow masses or [[granule (cell biology)|granules]] when [[staining|stained]] in [[Melzer's reagent]]. The cheilocystida ([[cystidia]] on the gill edge) are club-shaped, sometimes with an abruptly tapering point, and measure 17–26 by 9–15&nbsp;μm. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue is made of [[hypha]]e that are arranged in a roughly parallel fashion (subparallel); there are also brownish to orange-brown fat-containing hyphae present. The epicutis (outer layer of tissue) of the cap is made of a turf of gelatinous hyphae that measure 2.5–6&nbsp;μm wide; [[clamp connection]]s are absent to rare in the hyphae. The veil hyphae are 4–8&nbsp;μm wide, and [[hyaline]] (translucent) to yellow when mounted in a dilute solution of [[potassium hydroxide|KOH]]. The hyphae of the cortex of the stem are subparallel, and clamps are present.<ref name=Smith1972/>

Smith and Trappe noted a similarity to the European ''Cortinarius elatior'', but this species has violet gills at first.<ref name=Smith1972/> ''[[Cortinarius collinitis|C.&nbsp;collinitis]]'' has a lighter brown slimy cap, with glutinous bands on the stem that are rarely tinged purple. A third species in this group, ''[[Cortinarius cylindripes|C.&nbsp;cylindripes]]'' has a lighter colored, sometimes wrinkled cap, and gills that are pale purple when young with fringed edges.<ref name="urlCalifornia"/> ''[[Cortinarius stillatitius|C.&nbsp;stillatitius]]'' is a related European species found in coniferous (sometimes in [[mixed forest|mixed]]) forests.<ref name=Trudell2009/>  Another glutinous, dark-brown capped species with which ''C.&nbsp;vanduzerensis'' might be confused is ''[[Phaeocollybia spadicea]]'', but this species has pseudorhiza (a subterranean elongation of the stem) at the stem base and gills that are free from attachment to the stem.<ref name=GTR/>

==Habitat and distribution==
]]

''Cortinarius vanduzerensis'' is a [[mycorrhiza]]l mushroom that grows in association with [[conifer]] trees.<ref name="urlKuo"/> The fruit bodies grow solitarily, scattered, in [[fairy ring|rings]] or in groups under [[spruce]], [[Tsuga|hemlock]],<ref name=Smith1972/><ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> and [[Douglas-fir]].<ref name=Barroetavena2007/> The mushroom is known only from the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of North America,<ref name=Arora1986/> including the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]] on the north Coast of [[British Columbia, Canada]].<ref name="urlFungi of Haida Gwaii"/> It fruits in the autumn and early winter,<ref name=Arora1986/> or in the late summer in western Canada.<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/> Its frequency of occurrence has been described variously as "very common",<ref name=Trudell2009/> to "fairly common",<ref name=Arora1986/> or "rare" everywhere except Oregon".<ref name=SchalkwijkBarendsen1991/>
