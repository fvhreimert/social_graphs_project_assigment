'''''Craterellus tubaeformis''''' (formerly ''Cantharellus tubaeformis'') is an [[edible fungus]], also known as the '''winter chanterelle''',<ref>{{Cite book |last=Arora |first=David |title=All That the Rain Promises and More: A Hip Pocket Guide to Western Mushrooms |date=February 1991 |publisher=[[Ten Speed Press]] |isbn=978-0-89815-388-0 |location=Berkeley, CA |pages=6}}</ref> '''yellowfoot''', '''winter mushroom''', or '''funnel chanterelle'''. It was reclassified from ''[[Cantharellus]]'', which has been supported by [[molecular phylogenetics]].

''C. tubaeformis'' is a yellowish-brown and trumpet-shaped mushroom found in great numbers late in the mushroom season, thus earning the common name winter mushroom. The cap is convex and sometimes hollow down the middle. The gills are widely separated and of lighter color than the cap.

The species grows in temperate and cold parts of Northern America and Europe. It is [[mycorrhiza]]l, forming [[symbiotic]] associations with plants. It is an excellent food mushroom, especially [[frying|fried]] or in [[soup]]s.

==Taxonomy==
[[Molecular phylogenetics]] has shown that ''C. tubaeformis'' deserves its reclassification from ''[[Cantharellus]]'' to ''[[Craterellus]]''.  Additionally, it appears that there are two distinct genetic populations that have traditionally been called ''tubaeformis'': one in Europe and eastern North America, and another in western North America.  If these two groups are defined as separate species, the "eastern" yellowfoot would retain the scientific epithet ''tubaeformis'' due to the origin of the type specimens in Sweden.<ref name="dahl00" />

==Description==
The mushroom is mostly yellow with a grayish-brown [[Pileus (mycology)|cap]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |last=[[Audubon]] |title=Mushrooms of North America |publisher=[[Knopf]] |year=2023 |isbn=978-0-593-31998-7 |page=101}}</ref> The cap is {{Convert|1–4|cm|abbr=off|frac=4}} wide, generally flat with a depressed center, funnel-shaped, waxy, with a wavy margin, and mild odor and taste.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The [[Basidiospore|spores]] are whitish, elliptical, and smooth.<ref name=":0" /> The [[spore print]] is light orangish-pink.<ref name=":02" />

It usually fruits later than other mushrooms, sometimes near ''[[Hydnum repandum]]''.<ref name=":0" /> It usually grows in large groups.<ref name=":1" />

===Similar species===
It is smaller than ''[[Cantharellus cibarius]]'' (the golden chanterelle) and has a dark brown cap with paler gills and a hollow yellow stem. ''C.&nbsp;tubaeformis'' tastes stronger but less fruity than the golden chanterelle.

==Distribution and habitat==
It grows in temperate and cold parts of Northern America (near both coasts)<ref name=":02" /> and Europe, including Scandinavia, Finland, Russia, and the British Isles, as well as in the Himalayas in Asia, including [[Assam]],{{cn|date=July 2023}} in the central parts of the [[Indian subcontinent]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Borkar |first1=Pramod |last2=Doshi |first2=Anila |last3=Navathe |first3=Sudhir |year=2015 |title=Mushroom Diversity of Konkan Region of Maharashtra, India |url=http://en.calameo.com/read/001552297201c26c611cb |journal=Journal of Threatened Taxa |volume=7 |pages=7625–7640 |doi=10.11609/jott.o4283.7625-40 |doi-access=free |number=10}}</ref> and in Thailand.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Phosri |first1=Cherdchai |last2=Polme |first2=Sergei |last3=Taylor |first3=Andy F.

==Ecology==
The species is [[mycorrhiza]]l (forming [[symbiotic]] associations with plants), providing an obstacle to its [[Fungiculture|cultivation]].

The western North American ''C. tubaeformis'' has been shown to make [[ectomycorrhiza]]l relationships with western hemlock (''[[Tsuga heterophylla]]'') and Douglas-fir (''[[Pseudotsuga menziesii]]'').<ref name="trappe04" />
