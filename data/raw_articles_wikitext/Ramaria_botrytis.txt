'''''Ramaria botrytis''''', commonly known as the '''clustered coral''', the '''pink-tipped coral mushroom''', or the '''cauliflower coral''', is a species of [[coral fungus]] in the family [[Gomphaceae]]. The [[type species]] of the genus ''[[Ramaria]]'', ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' was first [[species description|described]] scientifically in 1797 by mycologist [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]].

The robust [[basidiocarp|fruit body]] can grow up to {{convert|15|cm|0|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|20|cm|0|abbr=on}} tall, and resembles some [[coral|marine coral]]. Its dense branches, which originate from a stout, massive base, are swollen at the tips and divided into several small [[branchlet]]s. The branches are initially whitish but age to [[buff (color)|buff]] or [[tan (color)|tan]], with tips that are pink to reddish. The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is thick and white. The [[spore]]s, yellowish in [[spore print|deposit]], are [[ellipsoid]], feature longitudinal striations, and measure about 13.8 by 4.7&nbsp;[[micrometers]]. It resembles several species of coral fungi, some of which require [[microscopy]] to reliably identify.

A widely distributed species, it is found in North America, Australia, North Africa, central and eastern Europe, and Asia. The fungus is [[mycorrhiza]]l with [[broadleaf trees]], and fruits on the ground in wooded areas. The fruit bodies are [[Edible mushroom|edible]] and young specimens have a mild, fruity taste. Some authors warn of [[laxative]] effects in susceptible individuals. The fungus contains several [[chemical compound]]s with ''[[in vitro]]'' biological activity, and fruit bodies have [[antimicrobial]] activity against several species and strains of [[drug-resistant]] bacteria that [[pathogen|cause disease]] in humans.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first named as ''Clavaria botrytis'' in 1797 by [[Christian Hendrik Persoon]].<ref name="Persoon 1797"/> In 1821, [[Elias Magnus Fries]] [[sanctioned name|sanctioned]] the genus name ''[[Clavaria]]'', and treated ''[[Ramaria]]'' as a [[section (biology)|section]] of ''Clavaria''.<ref name="Fries 1821"/> It was given its current name in 1918 by [[Adalbert Ricken]].<ref name="Ricken 1918"/> Obsolete historical [[Synonym (biology)|synonyms]] include [[Gotthold Hahn]]'s 1883 ''Corallium botrytis''<ref name="Hahn 1883"/> and [[Arthur Anselm Pearson]]'s [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''Clavaria botrytis'' var. ''alba'',<ref name="Pearson 1946"/> which is no longer recognized as an independent [[taxon]].<ref name="urlFungorum: Ramaria botrytis"/> Currie Marr and [[Daniel Stuntz]] described the variety ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' var. ''aurantiiramosa'' in their 1973 [[monograph]] of western [[Washington (state)|Washington]] ''Ramaria'';<ref name="Marr1973 pp.38-9">Marr and Stuntz (1973), pp. 38–9.</ref> Edwin Schild and G.&nbsp;Ricci described variety ''compactospora'' from Italy in 1998.<ref name="Schild 1998"/> In 1950, [[E. J. H. Corner|E.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;H. Corner]] published [[George F. Atkinson]]'s 1908 ''Clavaria holorubella'' as ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' var. ''holorubella'',<ref name="Corner 1950"/> but this taxon is now known as the independent species ''Ramaria holorubella''.<ref name="urlFungorum: Ramaria holorubella"/>

The [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] ''botrytis'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|βότρυς}} (''botrus'') meaning "bunch of grapes".<ref name="Rea 1922"/> The species is [[common name|commonly known]] as the "cauliflower coral",<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> the "pink-tipped coral mushroom",<ref name=Arora1986/> or the "rosso coral".<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> In the [[Cofre de Perote]] region of [[Veracruz]], Mexico, ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' is known by the local names ''escobea'', meaning "broom", or ''pechuga'', meaning "breast meat of chicken".<ref name="Jarvis 2004"/>

''Ramaria botrytis'' was designated the [[type species]] of ''Ramaria'' in 1933 by [[Marinus Anton Donk]].<ref name="Petersen 1968"/> Modern [[molecular phylogenetics|molecular]] analysis indicates that ''Ramaria'' is a [[polyphyletic]] assemblage of species with [[clavarioid fungi|clavarioid]] fruit bodies.<ref name="Humpert 2001"/><ref name="Hosaka 2006"/> According to the infrageneric [[classification (biology)|classification]] scheme proposed by Marr and Stuntz, ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' is included in the [[subgenus]] ''Ramaria'', which includes species that have grooved spores, [[clamp connections|clamps]] present in the [[hypha]]e, and fruit bodies with a large, profusely branched [[cauliflower]]-like appearance.<ref name="Marr1973 pp.38-9"/> [[Phylogenetic]] analysis of nuclear [[28S ribosomal RNA|large subunit]] [[ribosomal DNA]] suggests that ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' is closely related to ''[[Ramaria rubripermanens|R.&nbsp;rubripermanens]]'' and ''[[Ramaria rubrievanescens|R.&nbsp;rubrievanescens]]'', and that these species form a [[cladistics|clade]] that is [[sister group|sister]] (sharing a recent [[common descent|common ancestor]]) to the [[false truffle]] genus ''[[Gautieria]]'', the most [[Synapomorphy|derived]] group within the studied [[taxon|taxa]].<ref name="Humpert 2001"/>

==Description==

The [[basidiocarp|fruit bodies]] produced by the fungus are {{convert|6 to 20|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} tall and {{convert|4 to 30|cm|abbr=on|frac=2}} wide.<ref name="Corner 1950"/><ref>{{Cite book|last1=Davis|first1=R.

The [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is solid and white,<ref name=Arora1986/> and has an odor described variously as indistinct<ref name="Jordan 2004"/> or pleasant.<ref name="Kibby 1994"/> A drop of [[Melzer's reagent]] applied to the stem tissue reveals a weak [[amyloid (mycology)|amyloid]] staining [[Chemical tests in mushroom identification|reaction]] that often requires more than 30 minutes to develop. This reaction can be used to help distinguish ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' from other similar fungi.<ref name="Marr1973 pp.38-9"/>

[[Basidiospore|Spore]]s are produced by [[basidia]] on the outer surface of the branches. Viewed in [[spore print|deposit]], the spores are pale yellow. Microscopically, they have fine longitudinal or oblique striations that often fuse together in a vein-like network. They range in shape from roughly cylindrical to sigmoid (curved like the letter "S"), and their dimensions are 12–16 by 4–5&nbsp;[[μm]].<ref name="Burt 1922"/><ref name="Ellis 1990"/> Basidia are four-spored (occasionally two-spored), and measure 59–82 by 8–11&nbsp;μm. The [[sterigma]]ta (slender projections of the basidia that attach to the spores) are 4–8&nbsp;μm long. The [[hymenium]] and subhymenium (the tissue layer immediately under the hymenium) combined are about 80&nbsp;μm thick. Hyphae comprising the subhymenium are interwoven, 2.5–4.5&nbsp;μm in diameter, thin-walled, and clamped.<ref name="Marr1973 pp.38-9"/>

The variety ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' var. ''aurantiiramosa'' is distinguished from the more common variety by the orange color of the upper branches.<ref name="Castellano 1999"/> Variety ''compactospora'' tends to show a more pronounced wine-red, purple, or reddish color in the branch tips, and has smaller spores measuring 9.2–12.8 by 4–5.4&nbsp;μm.<ref name="Schild 1998"/>

==Habitat and distribution==
An [[ectomycorrhiza]]l species, ''R. botrytis'' forms [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] associations with [[broadleaf tree]]s, particularly [[beech]]. In a study to determine the effectiveness of several edible ectomycorrhizal fungi in promoting growth and nutrient accumulation of [[large-fruited red mahogany]] (''Eucalyptus pellita''), ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' was the best at improving root colonization and [[macronutrient]] uptake.<ref name="Aggangan 2013"/> Records of associations with [[conifer]]s<ref name="audu" /> probably represent similar species.<ref name="Roberts 2011"/> Fruit bodies grow on the ground singly, scattered, or in small groups among leaves in woods.<ref name="Burt 1922"/> They can also grow in [[fairy ring]]s.<ref name="Dickinson 1982"/> ''Ramaria botrytis'' is a "[[snowbank fungus]]", meaning it commonly fruits near the edges of melting snowbanks in the spring.<ref name=Arora1986/> In Korea, it is prevalent at sites that also produce the choice edible species ''[[Tricholoma matsutake]]''.<ref name="Na 1992"/>

''Ramaria botrytis'' is found in Africa ([[Tunisia]]),<ref name="Saldi 2009"/> Australia,<ref name="May 2003"/> Chile, Asia (including the eastern [[Himalayas]] of India,<ref name="Thind 1985"/> Nepal,<ref name="Boa 2004"/> Japan,<ref name="Yaoita 2007"/> Korea,<ref name="Na 1992"/> Pakistan,<ref name="Gardezi 2002"/> China,<ref name="Boa 2004"/> the [[Russian Far East|Far East of Russia]],<ref name="Govorova 2003"/> and Turkey)<ref name="Sesli 2006"/> and Europe (including the Netherlands,<ref name="Tolsma 1999"/> France,<ref name="INPN 2013"/> Portugal,<ref name="Barros 2009"/> Italy,<ref name="Pieroni 1999"/> Bulgaria,<ref name="Boa 2004"/> and Spain).<ref name="Rivera 2007"/> It is widely distributed in North America<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> (October–January on the West Coast and July–September elsewhere),<ref name="audu" /> where it is most common in the southeast and along the [[Pacific Coast]]<ref name="Dickinson 1982" /> but also appears in Mexico and [[Guatemala]].<ref name="Boa 2004" /> The variety ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' var. ''aurantiiramosa'', limited in distribution to [[Lewis County, Washington]], associates with [[Douglas-fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii'') and [[western hemlock]] (''Tsuga heterophylla'').<ref name="Castellano 1999"/> Variety ''compactospora'' is known from [[Sardinia]], Italy, where it has been found growing in sandy soil in forests comprising [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''Arbutus unedo''), [[tree heath]] (''Erica arborea''), and [[Quercus agrifolia|holm oak]] (''Quercus ilex'').<ref name="Schild 1998"/>

==Uses==
''Ramaria botrytis'' is an [[edible mushroom|edible]] species, and some rate it as choice.<ref name=Arora1986/><ref name="Bessette 1997"/> Its taste is "slight", or "fruity",<ref name="Jordan 2004"/> and has been likened to [[sauerkraut]], green peanuts (fresh harvested peanuts that have not been dehydrated), or pea pods.<ref name="Coker 1923"/> Older fruit bodies develop an acidic flavor.<ref name="Dickinson 1982"/> It is sold in food markets in Japan as ''Nedzumi-take'',<ref name="Yaoita 2007"/> and harvested from the wild in Korea and Nepal.<ref name="Dugan 2011"/> The thick base and main branches require longer cooking than the smaller branchlets.<ref name="Dickinson 1982"/> In the [[Garfagnana]] region of central Italy, the mushroom is stewed, or [[pickled]] in oil.<ref name="Pieroni 1999"/><ref name="Wright 2001"/> Fruit bodies can be preserved by slicing thinly and drying.<ref name="Burrows 2005"/> One field guide rates the edibility as "questionable", warning of the possible danger of confusing specimens with the poisonous ''Ramaria formosa''.<ref name="McKnight 1987"/> Other authors warn that some individuals may experience [[laxative]] effects from consuming the mushroom.<ref name=Arora1986/><ref name="Fergus 2003"/> Caution is advised when collecting fruit bodies near polluted areas, as the species is known to [[bioaccumulate]] toxic [[arsenic]].<ref name="Slekovec 1996"/>

Chemical analysis shows ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' to have a [[food energy]] value of 154 [[kilojoule]]s per 100 grams of fresh fruit bodies,<ref name="Barros 2008"/> which is comparable to the 120–150 kJ range reported for commercially grown edible mushrooms. As a percentage of [[dry matter]], the fruit bodies contain 39.0% crude [[protein (nutrient)|protein]], 1.4% [[lipid]]s, 50.8% [[carbohydrate]]s, and 8.8% [[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]. The majority of the lipid content comprises [[oleic]] (43.9%), [[linoleic]] (38.3%), and [[palmitic]] (9.9%) [[fatty acid]]s.<ref name="Kalač 2009"/>

===Chemistry===


[[Extract]]s of the fruit body of ''Ramaria botrytis'' have been shown to favorably influence the growth and development of [[HeLa]] cells grown in [[tissue culture]].<ref name="Chung 1979"/> The mushroom contains [[nicotianamine]], an [[ACE inhibitor]] ([[angiotensin-converting enzyme]]).<ref name="Izawa 2006"/> Nicotianamine is a metal-[[chelating]] compound essential in iron metabolism and utilization in plants.<ref name="Briat 2007"/> Several [[sterol]]s have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22''E'')-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, [[ergosterol peroxide]], [[cerevisterol]], and {{Nowrap|9α-hydroxycerevisterol}}, in addition to the previously unknown [[ceramide]] (2''S'',2{{'}}''R'',3''R'',4''E'',8''E'')-''N''-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.<ref name="Yaoita 2007"/>

[[Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing|Laboratory tests]] show that fruit bodies have [[antimicrobial]] activity against several strains of [[drug-resistant]] bacteria that are [[pathogen]]ic in humans. Extracts [[bacteriostatic agent|inhibit]] the growth of the [[gram-positive]] bacteria ''[[Enterococcus faecalis]]'' and ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]'', and [[bactericide|kill]] the gram-positive species ''[[Pasteurella multocida]]'', ''[[Streptococcus agalactiae]]'' and ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes|S.&nbsp;pyogenes]]''.<ref name="Alves 2012"/> 

In a 2009 study of 16 Portuguese edible wild mushroom species, ''R.&nbsp;botrytis'' was shown to have the highest concentration of [[phenolic acid]]s (356.7&nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] per [[kilogram|kg]] of fresh fruit body), made up largely of [[protocatechuic acid]]; it also had the highest [[antioxidant]] capacity. Phenolic compounds—common in fruits and vegetables—are being scientifically investigated for their potential health benefits associated with reduced risk of [[chronic disease|chronic]] and [[degenerative disease]]s.<ref name="Barros 2009"/>
