'''''Amanita zambiana''''', commonly known as the '''Zambian slender Caesar''', is a [[basidiomycete]] [[fungus]] in the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. An [[edible mushroom]], it is found in Africa, where it is commonly sold in markets.

== Description ==
The [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] attains a diameter of {{convert|10|to|20|cm|abbr=off|frac=2}}. It is initially spherical to egg-shaped and uniformly [[wikt:olivaceous|olivaceous]] brown in color, but later becomes flattened and uniformly white from the center. The sticky cap surface is smooth and shiny, and does not retain any fragments of the [[partial veil]]; the cap margin has fine radial grooves. [[lamella (mycology)|Gills]] are free from attachment to the [[stipe (mycology)|stem]], white, and up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} broad (measuring from the top to the bottom of the gill). Crowded closely together, they are interspersed with three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap margin to the stem). The gill edges are finely notched and have a woolly appearance. The stem is {{convert|10|to|15|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=2}} long by {{convert|1.5|to|2|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick, cylindrical, stout, and hollow. Its surface is whitish, [[wikt:fibrillose|fibrillose]], and ringed. An ample membrane-like [[annulus (mycology)|ring]] is finely grooved and attached to the upper part of the stem. At the base of the stem lies a broad sac-like [[volva (mycology)|volva]], which has dimensions of {{convert|5|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=4}} by {{convert|3|to|5|cm|in|abbr=on|frac=4}}. Initially black-brown in color, the outer layer of the volva eventually breaks up into large warts. The soft cap [[trama (mycology)|flesh]] is up to {{convert|1.5|cm|in|1|abbr=on|frac=4}} thick in the center, white, and does not change color when cut. [[Spore]]s are 9–13 by 8–10.5&nbsp;[[micrometre|μm]], roughly spherical to broadly egg-shaped, [[hyaline]] (translucent), [[inamyloid]], thin-walled, and usually contain a single oil drop.<ref name="Pegler 1997" />

==Taxonomy==
The species was first [[species description|described]] scientifically by British mycologists [[David Pegler]] and Graham Piearce from [[Zambia]] in 1980 in an account of popular [[edible mushroom]]s of Zambia.<ref name="Pegler 1980"/> Piearce had published an illustration of the species three years earlier, but without a description.<ref name="Piearce 1977"/> The [[type (biology)|type]] specimen was purchased on the roadside between [[Kitwe]] and [[Ndola]] in January, 1975. It is [[classification (biology)|classified]] in the [[section (botany)|section]] ''Vaginatae''.<ref name="Pegler 1980"/> French mycologist Bart Buyck has suggested that the species described by Beeli in 1936<ref name="Beeli 1936"/> as ''Amanita loosii'' from Zaire may represent an earlier name for the species;<ref name="Buyck 1994"/> this opinion was corroborated later by Walleyn and Verbeken in their survey of ''Amanita'' in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref name="Walleyn 1998"/>

== Distribution and habitat ==
Like all ''Amanita'' species, ''A.&nbsp;zambiana'' is [[mycorrhiza]]l. It typically associates with trees in the genus ''[[Brachystegia]]''. Fruit bodies are often found in small groups at the side of gravel roads. Its [[range (biology)|distribution]] includes Zimbabwe,<ref name="deRoman 2010"/> Zambia, [[Malawi]], and southern [[Tanzania]]. In Zambia, it is known locally as ''tente'' in the [[Bemba language]], or ''ndelema'' in [[Kaonde]] and [[Nyanja]]. It is also known as the ''Christmas mushroom'', as it is most abundant around December and early January.<ref name="Pegler 1980"/> A popular edible,<ref name="Harkonen 1995"/> it contributes significantly to Zimbabwean household [[food security]] when it is in season.<ref name="Zimbabwe 2009"/> It is widely marketed at roadside stalls and markets, but only the cap is sold. Occasionally, the mushroom is dried for storage, but only after first boiling it and draining the water.<ref name="Pegler 1997"/> According to a 2002 publication, the average price paid to mushroom harvesters in Zambia was about US$3 per kg.<ref name="deRoman 2010"/>
