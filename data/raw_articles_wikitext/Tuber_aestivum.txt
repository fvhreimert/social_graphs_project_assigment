The '''summer truffle''' (''Tuber aestivum'') or '''burgundy truffle''' (''Tuber uncinatum'') is a species of [[truffle]], found in almost all European countries.<ref name="Hall 106">[https://books.google.com/books?id=taQGqqcaEYoC&pg=PA107 Hall et al., 106-110]</ref>

==Taxonomy==
In cuisine and commerce, particularly in France and Italy, the summer truffle (''T. aestivum'') is distinguished from the burgundy truffle (''T. uncinatum''). However, molecular analysis showed in 2004 that these two varieties of truffle are one [[species]]. The differences between them are therefore likely due to environmental factors.<ref name="Hall 61">[https://books.google.com/books?id=taQGqqcaEYoC&pg=PA61 Hall et al., 61-63]</ref><ref>Paolocci et al.</ref>

This article uses the older of the two [[binomial name]]s, or senior synonym, ''T. aestivum'', to designate the species,<ref>As recommended by Hall et al., 63.</ref> while discussing the characteristics of the two varieties separately.

==Burgundy truffles==
Burgundy truffles ({{langx|fr|truffe de Bourgogne}}; {{langx|it|tartufo nero di [[Fragno]]}} or ''scorzone'', "bark"; {{langx|es|trufa de verano}}; {{langx|ca|tòfona gravada}}; {{langx|sv|svart sommartryffel}}), have a  [[hazelnut]]-like aroma and are prized for their gastronomic qualities. They are used in the ''[[haute cuisine]]'' of France and Italy, sometimes as a less expensive, milder substitute for the Périgord black truffle (''[[Tuber melanosporum|T. melanosporum]]'') when the latter are not available. Like other truffles, they are also packaged for export.<ref name="Hall  61" />

With bodies ([[ascocarp]]s) from {{convert|2|to|10|cm|in|0|abbr=off}} in diameter, burgundy truffles are relatively large. Their brown or black outer skin ([[peridium]]) forms pyramidal warts about {{convert|3|to|9|mm|in|frac=32|abbr=on}} wide, resembling rough [[Bark (botany)|bark]].<ref name="Hall  61" />

Burgundy truffles are harvested from September to late December, sometimes also until late January.<ref name="Hall  61" /> They have a wider distribution than any other truffle species. Burgundy truffles are found across Europe, from Spain to eastern Europe and from Sweden to North Africa. In France they are found mainly in the north-east and in Italy, in the north. In the United Kingdom they were plentiful prior to the 20th century, but are now rare. Their distribution may not yet be definitively established: there are as of 2007 unconfirmed reports of findings in China.<ref name="Hall 106" />

==Summer truffles==
The flavor, size and color of summer truffles ({{langx|it|tartufo estivo}}; {{langx|fr|truffe d'été}}; {{langx|ca|tòfona d'estiu}}) is similar to that of burgundy truffles, but their aroma is less intense and the flesh ([[gleba]]) is a paler hazel color.<ref name="Hall  61" />

As their name suggests, summer truffles are harvested earlier than burgundy truffles, from May to August.<ref name="Hall  61" /> They are most often found in the southern part of the distribution area of the species, notably in the [[Mediterranean climate]] areas of France, Italy and Spain.<ref name="Hall 106" />
